# Study 1: Building the AI Story Scale
This is the initial study for drafting the items for the AISS, and exploring their factorial structure. Based on the results of this study, I constructed the version of the AISS.

This study also contains a few proof-of-concept analyzes to show how the AISS can be used to gain a more detailed understanding of how different generation settings can lead to different type of stories.

## Method
### Participants
For this study, 398 participants were recruited from two sources: I gathered participants from the community of users of AI storytelling apps as well as from panels for academic research.

* Community: Recruited from community forums of users of AI storytelling apps. Recruitment was carried out on the [NovelAI Discord](https://discord.com/invite/novelai), [NovelAI Reddit](https://discord.com/invite/novelai) and the [AI Multiverse Discord](https://discord.com/invite/puRyrw869h). (165 participants)
* Panels: Recruited from panels for academic research ([SurveySwap.io](https://surveyswap.io/) and [SurveyCircle.com](https://www.surveycircle.com/)). (233 participants)

The survey for participant panels did contain two additional quality-control items to sort out respondents with low data quality. This led to the exclusion of 72 participants. Furthermore, three participants did not provide answers for all items and were also excluded. This left 323 participants for the analysis (162 from the community sample, 161 from the panels sample).

### Item Generation
In order to draft the questions for the AISS, I took stock of existing scales for evaluating different aspects of stories. Existing research that I deemed relevant for evaluating subjective story experiences included are summarized in the following table:

| Authors (Year) | Title | Measured Factors (# Items) | Psychometric Validation? | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| [Bussele & Bilandzic</br>(2009)](http://hypermedia468.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/80687372/measuring%20narrative%20engagement.pdf) | Measuring Narrative Engagement | Narrative Engagement (4 Subscales):</br>- Narrative Understanding<br>- Attentional Focus<br>- Narrative Presence<br>- Emptional Engagement</br>(3 per subscale) | Yes<br>(EFA & CFA study) | Scale was originally intended for measuring narrative engagement with movies, and has not been used in research on GLMs.</br>Most measured factors were deemed to high-level for the purpose of judging current stories from GLMs.</br>Only (modified) items for narrative understanding were considered relevant for the AISS. |
| [Purdy, Wang, He, & Riedl</br>(2018)](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~riedl/pubs/purdy-aiide18.pdf) | Predicting Generated Story Quality with Quantitative Measures | - Grammaticality</br>- Temporal Ordering</br>- Local Contextuality</br>- Repetition</br>- Interesting Language</br>- Enjoyment</br>- Quality</br>(1 item each) | No | |
| [Tambwekar et al.</br>(2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10736.pdf) | Controllable Neural Story Plot Generation via Reward Shaping  | - Single Plot</br>- Sopa Opera</br>(1 item each) | No | </br>The question on resemblance to a soap opera was specific to the tested model, and not used for this study.</br>Also contained the 7 items from [Purdy et al., 2018](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~riedl/pubs/purdy-aiide18.pdf) |
| [DeLucia, Mueller & Li</br>(2021)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07375.pdf) | Decoding Methods for Neural Narrative Generation | - Interestingness</br>- Fluency</br>- Coherence</br>- Relevance</br>(1 item each) | No | Original items were [double-barreled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-barreled_question) (or even multiple-barreled) and deemed unnecessarily complex for participants.</br>However, descriptions provided for the factors were quite detailed and were used as inspiration for item generation.</br>Relevance regards the study of the prompt -> output relationship, which is not the current focus of the AISS and was therefore not considered further. |

_Notes: EFA = exploratory factor analysis, CFA = confirmatory factor analysis._

I then categorized these existing items into different hypothesized story aspects. These story aspects were coherence, creativity, general story quality, repetitiveness and writing style.

Furthermore, I interviewed various users of AI storytelling apps to gather feedback on what aspects of AI-generated stories they deem important. Based on these interviews, I reviewed the existing list of items gathered from existing research and decided to add two more tentative story aspects, namely consistent characterization and pace.

After establishing these 7 initial story aspects, I inspected the number of items per story aspect. In accordance with common guidelines for scale construction I aimed for 8-12 provisional items per factor, anticipating that I would discard roughly half of my drafted items ([Hinkins et al., 1998](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/109442819800100106)). Therefore, I drafted additional items as needed in order to create a solid base for later scale construction. This led to a total of 73 provisional items for the first draft of the AISS.

### Procedure
After signing an informed consent, participants first read a story excerpt of roughly 5 minute reading time. For participants from the panel sample, the story excerpt was followed by the first quality-control question. Subsequently, participants evaluated the story excerpts on the 73 provisonal items for the AISS.

## Results
### Item Reduction
#### Preliminary Analysis
Initial inspection of the intercorrelations between the items showed a sufficient number of correlations above the recommended threshold of |_r_| > .3 ([Tabachnik, Fidell, 2018](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/using-multivariate-statistics/P200000003097?view=educator)). However, the determinant was far below the recommend threshold of _det_ > .00001, indicating strong multicollinearity and the presence of redundant items. To address this issue, I removed the item with the highest variance inflation factor (VIF) in an iterative process, until the determinant was above .00001. This resulted in the exclusion of 42 questions with 31 remaining items, _det_ = 00002.
The appropriateness of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) for this data was assessed using the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy. The KMO indicated that the data was well-suited for EFA, _KMO_ = .86.
