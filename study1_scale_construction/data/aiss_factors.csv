The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""You're sure this is where we need to go?"" he asked. ""The river here doesn't look very deep.""
""This is one of the most important places in all of the lands,"" said Naius. ""People come here from all around to pay homage to the gods and pray for guidance.""
""I see,"" said Olem, though that wasn't quite what he meant.
Naius didn't seem to notice his confusion. ""It's about time you saw something so beautiful. I'm tired of your complaining. You'd think you were back at home again.""
Olem shook his head. He hated how easily his friend could get him riled up these days. As much as he hated to admit it, there was truth to Naius' words. He had been complaining more than usual since they left Aratay and headed south, and now here was another example. If only he would just shut up and let them continue on without questioning every little thing.
They walked down a dirt road that meandered between the houses toward the center of the village. Olem eyed the buildings as they passed. They weren't large like the ones in the cities they had visited, but they looked sturdy enough. There were no windows and few doors that he could see, but the rooflines all appeared to be constructed from wood rather than stone. The whole place smelled of fresh air and pine needles.
Ahead of them, Naius stopped abruptly and turned to face the wall surrounding the town. It was low enough that Olem couldn't see over it, but he could tell that a gate stood open at the top.
""That's odd,"" said Olem.
He stepped forward to see if he could make out any details, but the wall blocked his view completely.
""What do you mean?""
""Well, shouldn't there be guards here? This looks like an obvious spot to watch who comes and goes into the village.""
""So what? We'll just have to sneak in past whoever is guarding the gate.""
""We've already found ourselves in trouble once today. I don't want to risk getting caught again.""
Naius nodded thoughtfully, then took a step forward.
Olem jumped to keep pace with him. ""Wait! What are you doing?""
His friend kept walking forward until he reached the edge of the wall. Then he paused to peer over the top. He quickly disappeared from sight.
Olem waited for a moment, then called out, ""Hey, wait!""
There was no response. Olem tried to hear anything beyond the sounds of birds and water flowing over rocks.
After a moment, he turned around and started making his way back through the trees. When he neared the spot where they had emerged from the woods, he heard a sound behind him. He spun around and saw Naius coming back toward him, carrying something.
""What did you find up there?"" he asked.
""Nothing,"" answered Naius, tossing a handful of leaves onto the ground beside him. Olem bent down to pick them up.
""What are those?"" he asked. ""Are they from the trees?""
""No, these are from the forest floor.""
Olem glanced at him suspiciously. ""And what does that mean?""
""Just keep looking.""
Olem sighed in exasperation and set the leaves aside.
When he straightened back up, he was surprised to see that he was standing in front of the open gate.
Naius was waiting for him. ""This is the last one, Olem. Are you ready to go inside yet?""
The two of them climbed over the wall together, then made their way into the town.
As they walked, Olem studied the area carefully. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but he remained alert nonetheless. The villagers' clothing was different from what he was used to seeing in the city, but other than that, everything looked the same as it always did.
""Where are we going?"" he asked after a few minutes.
""To the temple of the gods. And believe me, you will not be disappointed.""
Olem followed his companion, wondering what sort of miracle Naius was talking about.
The streets were mostly empty, save for a couple of children playing nearby. Their parents, sitting on benches outside the buildings, watched them play until their youngest brother wandered too close to the edge of the lake. At that point, they all looked up and started shouting at him.
""What happened?"" asked Olem, stopping to listen.
""Don't wander off, boy!""
""Come back here right now!""
""I told you to stay away from the water!""
The boy, who couldn't have been older than eight, ran at the lake with a loud splash, startling several ducks that flew into the air in fright. His siblings laughed.
""Stop it!"" shouted one of the adults. ""You're going to scare them all away.""
The boy ignored her, running full speed toward the shore.
Then the scream came.
Olem dropped to his knees and covered his ears, trying to block out the sound. But it was no use. It pierced the air over and over again, echoing between the buildings.
Finally he realized that he recognized it.
""That's a woman's voice,"" he said.
Naius nodded grimly, clutching his forehead with both hands. ""Yes...it's terrible.""
He took a few steps closer to the water, then turned to stare at Olem. ""Do you know what this means?""
""I think so,"" said Olem. ""But let's get a little closer before we start guessing.""
They approached the edge of the lake, careful not to step inside the water itself.
Olem scanned the area, looking for any sign of the person who had screamed. There was nothing to indicate that anything bad had happened, which suggested that she hadn't fallen into the water after all.
""Maybe it was just a trick of the wind,"" he said, hoping to reassure himself.
""Do you really think that possible?"" asked Naius, moving closer to him. ""Think about it. What sort of noise would cause everyone within earshot to react this way?""
Olem frowned, thinking hard. He didn't have to search long for an answer.
""She was being murdered,"" he said.
Naius looked at him in horror. ""You can hear it?""
""Not exactly,"" answered Olem. ""But I know it's true. We just need to find her.""",1105,0.3928993309481726,1.088291667196539,0.3505880414599741,1.7558524826455226,0.5738780973688645
1,R_3CCMkj9T7UgOtgP,ALL_HR_3,Historical Romance,All-Nighter,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her long blonde hair was braided in intricate patterns and fell around her shoulders. The light from the candles on the table cast shadows against her pale skin, but even then, he could see that she was beautiful.
He'd been so busy staring at her that he hadn't noticed that another man had also noticed her. The man stood up, reached for the girl's hand and pulled her out of her chair.
""Go,"" he said to the young woman with a look of disgust. ""Go before I tell the owner to throw you out.""
She didn't need telling twice. She ran out of the tavern like a frightened child, leaving the other man sitting alone at the table.
He'd felt so angry that he wanted to get up and go after the man who had touched her, but he couldn't move. He just sat there staring after her until the other man left. When he got back to work later on that evening, he told everyone what had happened. Everyone agreed that he should do something about it. They were all men, and they knew how much he hated the idea of anyone touching a woman without her consent.
But he didn't know where to start looking. She might have gone home, or to one of the nearby brothels. But if he went to one of those places, he'd probably be beaten to within an inch of his life. That was what would happen if he went to any of the other taverns in the town, where men like him drank too much and thought with their dicks rather than their brains.
So he spent most of the night walking the streets, hoping that he would see her again, or at least some trace of her. By dawn, he was exhausted and sore all over. He'd walked all around the town, but hadn't found a single thing.
The next morning, he went to the market square and looked around there, but she wasn't there either. The only place he could think to look now was the church, and that's where he headed. He had no idea what he would say when he got there. All he knew was that he couldn't let the man who had hurt her walk free.
It took him almost half an hour to walk there, but when he finally got to the small church, he felt as though he had been walking for days. There were no windows, so it was dark inside. A single candle was lit in one corner of the room, but even its light barely penetrated the shadows. It was like walking through a tunnel, with just enough light to make out the path ahead of him.
He stood in the doorway, taking in the scene before him. A large wooden cross hung on the wall behind the altar. In front of him were rows of pews, which were filled with people. Men and women sat quietly, some praying, others looking straight ahead, while a few looked up at the ceiling. He was the only one standing, his eyes fixed on the cross.
A woman appeared from the shadows, a candle in her hand. ""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""but this is a private service. We're not allowed to allow anyone in.""
He turned to face her. ""You don't understand. I want to see if someone has been hurt here.""
""No one here has been hurt, and we can't help you anyway,"" she replied.
""But they have. She came into the tavern and I saw the man who did it. He left without paying for his drink. When she tried to leave, he pulled her back and grabbed at her. If you go up to the church and open the door, I know it will be there.""
She looked at him closely. ""You've been drinking. That's not very clever. You'll end up getting hurt if you go anywhere near that church. And I'm not going to let you in anyway, so there's no point in arguing.""
He stepped forward and reached out for her. ""Please. I won't ask again.""
The woman held up her hand to stop him. ""I don't think so. This isn't your fight. Go away, before I call the police.""
He grabbed hold of her wrist and pulled her towards him. ""Don't tell me what to do.""
He was too drunk to remember anything about it afterwards, but he remembered feeling angry, and then suddenly, everything went black.
When he woke up, he felt like he had been hit by a truck. He lay there for what seemed like an eternity, trying to remember where he was, but nothing would come. Finally, he got up and staggered across to the altar, where he looked down at the cross.
His eyes followed the path of the wooden beam to its base. The nails were still in place, and he could feel them digging into his hands as he moved closer to the cross. There was blood on some of them, but he couldn't see any sign of what had caused it.
He sat down in one of the pews and watched the people praying. Most of them were dressed in their Sunday best, but there were a few who were obviously drunk or high on drugs. They just stared ahead with vacant looks in their eyes.
It took him a while to realise why he was there. It wasn't because of the girl he'd seen that night, but because of something else. When he'd first started coming to the tavern, the men had always given him a hard time. Some of them would make fun of him because of the way he spoke, and others would take great delight in seeing him fall over. They didn't care if he was hurt; all they cared about was making him feel small.
He hated those people, and he wished that he could kill every one of them. He wanted to tear out their throats and rip out their hearts, just like he'd seen done in one of the movies. But he knew that he couldn't do that, even though it made him feel better sometimes. He was a man, not a monster.
So he left the church, went back to the tavern and drank himself to sleep.
The next morning, he woke up feeling more refreshed than he had for months. He felt as if he could face the world again, and that's exactly what he did.
He walked through the market square, heading towards the other taverns. He wasn't going there to start trouble; he just wanted to get some answers. As he passed each of them, he spoke to the owners, asking them if they had ever seen the girl he'd mentioned. But they all denied it. They told him she must have been lying.
By mid-afternoon, he had no more leads, so he went back to the church. He sat down in front of the altar once again, looking at the cross.
He looked up to see a woman standing in the doorway. She was holding a candle in her hand. ""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""but we can't let you in here.""",1239,-0.582793947548457,-1.2964000515775371,1.5132460828373586,0.8723022605661804,0.5366084761599507
2,R_3PBKFhmDXlAQNO6,ALL_HOR_2,Horror,All-Nighter,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had red eyes that were glowing in the dark, like they were made of flames.
The man in the mirror spoke. ""Hello there,"" he said. ""My name is John. You're dead."" He paused for a second as if he wanted to say more.
""Why did you do that?"" I asked, my voice coming out in a whisper. ""What is happening?""
The man in the mirror smiled and then started laughing. ""It's funny, isn't it?"" he said. ""You're dead and I'm alive.""
I didn't know what to say. What was going on? Why did this man keep talking to me when he should be dead too? I knew that I was dead, but why would a spirit speak to someone who was dead? Was I going crazy? Maybe I really was dying. That was it. The fever was finally getting to me and I was hallucinating.
""John,"" I said. ""Who are you?""
""My name is John,"" he repeated. ""You're dead and I'm alive.""
""No, that can't be right,"" I said. ""You died just like I did. We're both dead, remember? I saw your body lying there.""
""You don't have to see me to talk to me,"" John said. ""If you want, you can go to your grave and ask my ghost to speak to you instead of me. He'll be able to talk to you there. I just happen to be here because you are the one person who needs my help.""
""Why would I need your help?"" I asked. ""What do you mean by that?""
John took a deep breath and said, ""You've been given a second chance to live.""
""That can't be right,"" I said. ""I died. I saw your body. How can you possibly be alive?""
John smiled at me. ""We don't die in our world,"" he said. ""Not until we leave. You can't be dead if you don't know it yet.""
I stood up and walked over to the door. ""I have to get out of here,"" I said. ""I don't believe any of this. I need to get some fresh air.""
John nodded. ""I understand. That's exactly what you should do,"" he said. ""You don't have to believe it. Just take it on faith. Trust me, okay? I know what I'm talking about.""
""Okay,"" I said, not believing a word he was saying. ""But if I go outside, won't everyone see that I'm dead?""
""Yes,"" John said. ""That's true.""
""Then why don't you tell them?"" I asked.
John sighed and then looked at me with sad eyes. ""Because it wouldn't be fair,"" he said.
""Fair?"" I asked.
""It would be unfair for them to learn that you're dead without you knowing it,"" John said. ""I don't want to cause you more pain than you already have.""
I stared at the man in the mirror, not believing a word he said. But then I thought back to when I had been standing there next to my father. I remembered the look in his eyes when I had told him I was going to die. He'd been devastated. If he knew that I was still alive, would he feel better or worse? It didn't matter either way, I decided. What mattered most was that I got out of the room.
I grabbed my shoes and started putting them on. I was about to open the door when I heard someone call out from behind me. I turned around and saw a woman in black standing there. She was beautiful, even though her face was covered by a long white veil. She had red hair that fell down her shoulders, and her eyes were a dark blue.
""Who are you?"" I asked.
The woman smiled. ""I'm your guardian angel,"" she said. ""My name is Eve.""
""Eve?"" I asked. ""What does that mean?""
""It means I am the mother of all life,"" she replied. ""And now you are too.""
I couldn't believe what I was hearing. ""You're telling me that I'm going to live forever?"" I asked.
""That's right,"" she said.
I started laughing. ""This is crazy,"" I said. ""Why would anyone ever want to do that?""
Eve put her arm around my shoulder and said, ""Don't laugh. You'll find out soon enough.""
I felt a strange warmth coming off her skin, and I suddenly understood why people liked touching angels. There was something soothing about being near one of them. They made me feel safe, like nothing bad could happen to me if I was with them.
""Let's go,"" Eve said. ""You need to see what's outside so you can make up your mind.""
I looked at Eve and then back into the mirror. I was tempted to ask her where she was taking me, but I wasn't sure how to say it.
""I think I'd rather stay here,"" I said.
Eve shook her head and said, ""No. You have to go out there. I've already sent John to talk to you, but you still need to know the truth about yourself.""
She walked over to the bed and pulled out a blanket. Then she wrapped herself in it and placed the pillow on top of it. She looked back at me and said, ""Please don't be afraid.""
I took the blanket and the pillow from her. I wrapped myself up in them and said, ""I'm not afraid.""
Then I went to the door and opened it. The light hit me like a blow and I gasped. It hurt so much that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding again.
When I stood outside, I could finally see clearly. The first thing I noticed was the sky. It was so beautiful, even though it was filled with black clouds and dark gray skies. The trees were tall and green, and the grass was soft under my feet. I could smell the flowers all around me and hear the birds chirping. It was amazing to be alive again, but I still felt as if I was dreaming.
The ground started moving below me and I knew that I had to get away from it before it swallowed me whole. I ran for the house, but when I got there, I saw that it was on fire. I could see flames shooting up into the air, and they were spreading quickly. I turned and ran as fast as I could, but the fire followed me. It chased me down the hill and into a forest where the trees grew taller than any building.",1134,-1.572414248199465,-0.8936225486364533,1.466000203214635,0.42189570683707506,-0.8040090744810955
3,R_upGgPQKBWAUY7tL,LOW_HR_7,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The man's wife had been murdered and she was there to find out what the murderer looked like so that she could give her husband justice.
He'd never seen anyone so beautiful before. Tall and lithe, with long flowing blonde hair and bright blue eyes that shone like stars, she made him feel as if he was nothing more than dirt beneath her feet. He wanted to touch her skin, run his hands over her body until he felt those breasts under his palms, or better yet bury his nose in her neck and breathe deep the sweet scent of woman. It was as if someone had poured ice water down his back when he realized it wasn't a man sitting next to the pretty woman but a young woman who should have been his age. His mind was filled with a thousand images of him touching her, kissing her, loving her in ways that would make them both scream out with joy. He was a monster for even thinking such things about his own flesh and blood.
She left the tavern, telling him she needed to be alone to think. The image of her face stayed in his mind and tormented him every day. Her beauty had stolen his heart right from his chest. Every single time he closed his eyes all he could see was her.
After a time, she appeared again and came to his table. She sat down across from him and stared straight into his eyes without blinking once. ""I can't stop thinking about you,"" she said simply.
""And why is that?""
Her smile was radiant as she answered, ""Because I know what you are.""
He shook his head, confused. ""You do?""
""I'm a Hunter. My name is Talia. What's your name?""
He knew exactly how she knew what he was. ""My name is Gabriel. You must have heard of me.""
She smiled sadly, ""Yes, everyone has heard of you. You're famous around here. Everyone is terrified of you. There is no hope for us ever being together. If we were to get involved, there would be nothing good in our lives.""
He tried to hide his hurt by changing the subject. ""What makes you think that?""
""I've read many stories about Hunters and I've also heard what you did in the last battle against the evil King of Shadows.""
Gabriel nodded, ""I was only trying to save my people from slavery.""
Her voice took on an angry edge. ""But you killed hundreds of innocent men women and children because they were in the way of your fight. Is that really what you call saving them? You don't seem to care at all about what happened after the war ended.""
His voice softened as he explained, ""I know that's true but I have to keep them safe at all costs. There are too few of us to let anything happen to one of us.""
She stood up, tears in her eyes. ""Then you need to kill yourself. There are far too many bad memories for me now that I know what you are.""
Before Gabriel could say another word, she vanished. He went to find her later that night, determined that he wouldn't leave her side unless she was dead. He found her walking down the street towards a large building. He ran to catch up with her as quickly as he could, not wanting her to leave his sight again.
Once inside the building, she walked through the darkness to a small room that housed an enormous bed with dark red sheets. A beautiful woman lay on top of the covers, her head pillowed in Gabriel's lap while his fingers ran through her silken hair. Her eyes fluttered open slowly but didn't focus as they rested on him.
Talia watched silently as Gabriel gently lifted the woman's arm off the bed and put it around his shoulders. As soon as he touched her, she pulled away from him. ""Don't touch me!"" Her voice was cold as ice.
Talia turned around and began to walk away.
Gabriel called out to her in a gentle voice, ""Talia please wait, I want to speak to you.""
Her eyes snapped open and her anger grew. ""What do you want?""
He reached out and grabbed her hand, holding it tightly so that she couldn't pull away. ""You can't just leave, I won't allow it.""
She jerked her hand from his and screamed, ""I hate you! I despise you for being the monster everyone thinks you are and you still expect me to stay with you forever? No way! Never again will I be near you.""
Talia turned and stormed out the door leaving him behind. He sat in the chair, stunned. He didn't even try to stop her as she hurried away from him. It wasn't long before he lost sight of her completely.
It's been months since then. Gabriel has searched for any trace of her but has yet to find her. When he thought he saw her earlier tonight he ran after her only to learn she was nowhere to be found. He knows this is all part of his destiny; the Hunter and the woman he loves will never meet. But he still has hope that one day he will find her again.
He sighed and shook his head, wishing the night would end quickly so that he could go home and get some rest. Gabriel walked to the door of the tavern and paused, suddenly remembering what had brought him here in the first place.
""What's wrong?"" The innkeeper asked in alarm.
""Nothing,"" Gabriel replied, looking around to see if anyone else was paying attention to him. He opened the door and stepped outside. He looked both ways down the empty street then slipped into the shadows between two buildings.
His footsteps crunched against the loose gravel as he hurried towards the river. He crossed the bridge carefully and kept going, his heart pounding in his ears. He moved as quietly as he could, not wanting to scare away the animals that lived there. Once on the other side, he followed the path that led to the old ruins.
As he approached the entrance to the ancient cave, Gabriel heard voices coming from the shadows. He listened closely and recognized the sound of a man and a woman arguing.
""You need to tell me where she is,"" the man demanded angrily.
""I don't know,"" a soft voice whispered in response.
""How can you not know? Have you gone blind? Or maybe your brains have turned to mush?""
The woman was afraid of the angry man and was desperately trying to avoid confrontation. ""Please, let's talk about this somewhere else. I'm begging you.""
""We need to settle things right now,"" the man continued. ""I want you to tell me where she is.""
""No!"" she yelled, throwing herself down onto the ground. ""I can't betray my friends.""
Gabriel crept closer, his eyes focused on the couple. They seemed to be arguing about something very important and the woman sounded like she was hiding something big from him.
""Your friend isn't really your friend anymore,"" he growled.
""Stop saying that!"" the woman cried, struggling to stand up against him. ""Why do you keep insisting on hurting her?",1255,-0.11003165168331293,0.42995766831084314,1.3752638628800862,1.1311557257225984,0.2800376535952907
4,R_2A0WFAxmTP8WJRW,ALL_HOR_3,Horror,All-Nighter,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me.
It wasn't mine, but it did look vaguely familiar. I could see a few wrinkles around the eyes and a thin line going down from his nose to the bottom of his mouth. The face had no hair and wore an old, faded black suit with a red tie and matching handkerchief.
""Who are you?"" I said as I tried to open the door. It didn't budge, and the face just stared at me.
""You can call me Mr. Smith,"" he said in a deep voice that sounded like it was coming through the mirror. ""And if you ever want to leave this room alive, you'd better tell me who you are.""
I backed away and ran back into my bedroom. The mirror was still there, but when I went to shut off the light, I couldn't find the switch. Then I realized the lightbulb wasn't working, and it was dark in the room. I could still hear the sound of the knocking. I walked over to the mirror and tried to turn the handle to open the door, but it wouldn't move. I started banging on it.
""Please open!"" I yelled. ""I don't know you. You've got to let me out of here.""
The sound stopped for a second, then resumed again.
""Please stop!"" I screamed.
This time, the door opened a crack, and the face in the mirror looked down at me. ""I'm afraid I can't do that,"" he said. ""I've been sent to protect you. And I have to say, I haven't had much success so far.""
I took a few steps closer to the door and tried to grab the handle. It moved easily in my hand, but I couldn't pull it open.
""Mr. Smith?"" I said. ""If you're not Mr. Smith, who are you?""
""I'm just your reflection,"" he said.
I turned to go back into the bedroom when I saw something on the floor. As I bent down to pick it up, I realized it was my watch.
""What happened to it?"" I asked.
""It's nothing you need to worry about,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Just put it back on.""
I picked up the watch and put it on.
""Good,"" said the man in the mirror. ""Now, if you'd be so kind as to leave, I'll show you out.""
""How am I supposed to leave with you standing there?"" I asked.
""You're not,"" he said.
I stepped toward the mirror again, but before I could touch it, he disappeared. I grabbed the handle of the door and pulled hard. It didn't budge.
I started banging on it again. Then I remembered my cell phone and called my friend's number. He answered after a few rings.
""Hey, what's up?"" he said.
""It's me. Is that you in the mirror?""
""No.""
""I don't know this guy.""
""Neither do I,"" he said. ""He's a new face in town, and he says he's protecting me from some evil spirits.""
""Sounds like a bunch of hooey.""
""Yeah, I thought so too at first, but then I started seeing things.""
I told him about what had happened to me and asked him if he knew anything about Mr. Smith or the spirit world.
""Well, there's a lot I don't know about the spirit world,"" he said. ""But I've never heard of anything like what you described. Why don't you call your landlord? Maybe they can help.""
I hung up and went back into the bedroom. I got out my laptop and started looking around the internet for information about the man in the mirror. I found a few stories that mentioned him, but most of them were just rumors and urban legends.
The next day, I was sitting in a café drinking coffee when I saw Mr. Smith walk by. I followed him out of the café and followed him until he stopped in front of a building. I watched him go inside, and I realized he must have been waiting for someone. I decided to wait around to see who it was.
A few minutes later, a man came walking up to the door, and Mr. Smith opened it for him. The man walked inside, and Mr. Smith closed the door behind him. I waited outside until I couldn't see anyone in the window.
As soon as I turned to leave, the man came out. He looked like he hadn't slept in a week, and his eyes were red and puffy. Mr. Smith walked him to a car parked on the street and opened the door. Then they got into the backseat together, and they drove off.
I waited around for another hour, and then I got back in my car and left town. As I drove away, I wondered why the man had been so eager to get away from Mr. Smith. But then again, maybe there was no reason for him to be afraid of Mr. Smith. It didn't matter anyway; I'd seen enough, and I wasn't going to stick around any longer.
When I got home, I took a long hot shower. Then I put on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt, and I went to the kitchen for a beer. After a while, I started thinking about Mr. Smith, and I wondered what had become of him. Did he disappear after he helped the guy in the car? Or did he just disappear into thin air once the guy was gone?
The next day, I got back in my car and drove to the town where Mr. Smith said he was from. When I got there, I pulled up in front of a small apartment building, and I found a payphone across the street.
I called Mr. Smith's number and waited for someone to pick up. I hung up when I heard no answer. I called back and waited again, but no one answered. I kept calling back every half hour until finally I got an answering machine. I left a message saying I wanted to know more about the spirit world and how it works, and I told him to call me as soon as possible.
A few days later, I was at home when I heard the phone ring. I picked it up and saw that the caller was Mr. Smith. I didn't recognize his voice.
""Who is this?"" he asked. ""You don't know who this is, do you?""
""I'm not sure,"" I said. ""Can I help you with something?""
""Yes,"" he said. ""I want you to come over here right away.""
""Why?""
""Because I need your help.""
""How can I help you?""
""I have to ask you a few questions before you get here.""",1161,0.3618569459499632,-0.927168209360733,2.0959746101379566,-0.21603417965414595,0.8947130940335634
5,R_8G32A9CQhSkkXTj,ACE_HSF_6,Hard Sci-Fi,Ace of Spade,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I headed towards the center of town where most government buildings were located. The streets were quiet and empty as I made my way through the city. When I finally reached the presidential building I was surprised to see so few people around. Normally there would be throngs of tourists and journalists trying to get a glimpse of their new president. But today there was no one outside. Just as well; if they had been there then they would all know about the letter from the president.
Inside the lobby was also deserted except for a secretary who gave me directions to the president's office. As I walked up the stairs I could feel my heart beating faster. This was really happening! I wasn't sure how the president was going to react to the news that I'd found another alien race but I knew he wanted to talk to me about it. If he didn't want to hear anything more about the aliens then I couldn't do anything about that. So long as he wanted to speak to me I was willing to give him what information I had. That was all I could do anyway.
When I stepped into the president's office he stood up and came over to shake hands. He was a tall man with a shaved head and wore a simple gray suit. His handshake felt firm and confident.
""It's good to finally meet you, Mr. Davis,"" he said. ""I'm President Janssen. You must forgive us for not being able to come down to greet you when you arrived.""
""That's alright, sir,"" I replied. ""The whole world is watching right now so I don't think you can blame anyone else for that.""
We sat down and he asked me to tell him everything I had learned since arriving on Mars. After a couple hours of talking he stopped me mid sentence.
""So, what are your conclusions?"" he asked.
I told him about the alien ship that crashed on the surface of the planet and the creatures inside it. I explained that I thought the creatures were probably the same species as the ones living in the underground caverns and tunnels under the surface of the planet. I described them in detail and showed him some of the photos I'd taken during our journey.
""And you're certain these are the same kind of aliens that live beneath the surface?"" he asked.
I nodded.
""Well, that certainly makes things easier,"" he said. ""But I still need to understand exactly why these aliens decided to build ships like this.""
""You mean why they built their own space vessels? Why they left Earth behind?""
""Exactly,"" he replied. ""There are several possible answers to those questions. Some of them will be good and some won't. Which do you think is correct?""
My mind raced back to the alien ship in the crater. It looked like something that had been designed by humans, yet it seemed so alien to me. Was there any possibility that someone else had created it?
""If I had to guess, I'd say that whoever built this vessel did so because they believed that Earth had become too dangerous for them,"" I said. ""They saw humanity as a threat and needed to leave.""
""But that doesn't explain how they got here in the first place,"" he pointed out. ""How did they even find our planet?""
""Well, if they did indeed leave Earth, then perhaps they followed the same path as the other civilizations that have gone before us. They may have used some sort of wormhole or warp drive technology to travel between star systems.""
The president shook his head.
""No, that doesn't make sense either. We've studied every bit of data we have on ancient human history and nobody ever mentions any such thing. In fact, our best scientists agree that the only way we managed to reach the stars is by traveling via rocketships.""
""But maybe they didn't use rocketships,"" I suggested. ""Maybe they flew here using some other method.""
""Like what?""
""I don't know. Maybe they used some kind of wormholes, or hyperdrive engines.""
""What difference does it make if they came here by rocket or spaceship? What matters is whether they have the ability to communicate with us. And judging from what you've seen, they clearly can't.""
He paused and stared at me for a moment, thinking hard. Then he turned to me.
""Okay, let me ask you another question,"" he said. ""Are you absolutely certain that the creatures living beneath the surface are the same as the ones above ground?""
""Yes, sir. I'm completely sure of it.""
""Why?""
I hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to answer his question.
""Because... Well... I just am. It feels right to me, sir.""
He smiled at me.
""Thank you, Mr. Davis. Your instincts seem to be working just fine for once.""
As I walked away from the president's office I couldn't help smiling to myself. It was nice to know that someone actually believed me. The rest of the day was spent talking to different people within the administration. Everyone agreed that I was telling the truth. Even the president himself admitted that he wasn't entirely sure about the alien story, but that he was willing to listen to me. By nightfall I was exhausted from speaking to so many people. All I wanted to do was go home, take a shower and sleep.
I was lying in bed, listening to music and reading a book when there was a knock on my door. When I opened it I saw two men standing outside. One of them introduced himself as the head of security and handed me an envelope.
""This is a personal note from the president to you,"" he said. ""He wants you to open it in private, but he also asks that you read it aloud to him.""
I took the envelope and thanked him before closing the door. I carefully opened the envelope and pulled out a sheet of paper. The president's handwriting was neat and clear to read, despite his age.
""Mr. Davis,
""I have been thinking long and hard about your discovery. I realize that I cannot deny that you have uncovered evidence of a new alien race. But I also know that I cannot accept your claims without concrete proof. There is a great deal of work ahead of us and I hope that together we can continue to discover the truth. I would like to invite you to join me for a meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss the situation further. Please meet me in my office at 1:00 PM. I look forward to seeing you again.
""Sincerely,
""John Janssen, President of the United States of America.""
I read the letter to myself twice before putting it down and looking at the clock on my wall. It was already 11:30 PM so I knew that if I wanted to get enough sleep I'd better hit the sack soon.",1231,1.4930755883469664,-0.1736831588961901,0.4093941326353541,-0.03013630079817072,-0.11470457541341283

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I made my way across town to the presidential palace where I would be meeting with the president himself. As I approached, I saw a small crowd forming outside of the gates, but no one was actually waiting there. Curious, I walked up and asked what they were all standing around for. One man told me that he had heard the president had arrived yesterday.
""You mean the president is here?"" I asked, surprised by the news. He nodded.
""Yes. We've been expecting you,"" he replied.
I shook his hand then turned towards the front doors when another person stepped forward and told me not to go any further. I looked back at him confused as he handed me a badge with a number printed on it. ""This will get you through security. You'll need it to enter the inner circle,"" he said, pointing to the line of people who had gathered behind me. I put my hands inside my pockets, trying to figure out why they'd give me a badge if they didn't want me to go in. When I thought about it, it made sense. The only reason anyone would ever be given a badge like that was because they were expected to show up somewhere. And since they were giving them away now, obviously someone had come to see me today.
That was enough for me. I put the badge on and went into the palace, walking past several armed guards who eyed me warily as I passed. Inside, I was greeted by two other men wearing similar badges, which meant I could proceed deeper into the compound. Once inside, I followed the signs until I came to a set of double doors that led to the president's office. I walked in, passing several more security checkpoints along the way, finally arriving at the president's office.
The room was large and well decorated, filled with paintings of historical figures, sculptures of important scientists, and various artifacts of ancient civilizations. It wasn't quite as impressive as some of the rooms in the White House or even Buckingham Palace, but it still held its own. A man in a black suit stood next to the door, looking at me expectantly as I approached. ""Good morning, Mr. Smith,"" he said as I entered the room. His voice sounded familiar, though I couldn't place it. ""I'm President Theodore Roosevelt.""
""Hello, Mr. President,"" I said, shaking his hand. ""My name is Peter Smith, and I believe you know my father.""
The president smiled warmly. ""Of course I do. I understand your family has been very supportive of our efforts here on Mars.""
""Yes sir, we certainly have. That's why I'm here today,"" I explained.
President Roosevelt nodded, motioning to the seat across from his desk. ""Please, take a seat. There's something I wanted to discuss with you.""
""What did you wish to speak with me about, Mr. President? Was it something related to the work I'm doing on Mars?"" I asked.
""Not exactly, though I think you might find it interesting. First, let me apologize for making you wait so long for my arrival,"" he began, sitting down in his chair. ""It's just that we've received a lot of attention recently, both positive and negative, and I felt it best to avoid unnecessary distractions while we're dealing with everything else going on here.""
I sat down too and nodded. ""No problem, Mr. President. I can appreciate how busy you must be right now. Is there anything I can help you with?""
The president smiled again. ""Actually, yes. I was hoping you might be able to assist us with a new initiative.""
""New initiative?"" I repeated.
""Yes. I've spoken with many of my advisors about this idea, and they all agree it would be beneficial to humanity, particularly if implemented early enough,"" he explained.
""Early enough?"" I questioned. ""For what purpose?""
""We're working hard to prepare for a future where humans may have to leave Earth entirely,"" he answered.
""Leave Earth…you mean go to another planet?"" I asked incredulously.
""Precisely,"" he confirmed. ""Right now, we don't have any plans to abandon our home world, but we're always prepared for such an eventuality. In fact, I think it would be wise to begin preparing for such a move immediately rather than waiting until we absolutely have to make the decision to evacuate. If we start moving things off-planet now, it should make things easier when it comes time to relocate.""
""Moving things off-planet…that sounds expensive,"" I remarked.
""Well, it would be. But we are talking about a much larger undertaking than simply relocating a few hundred thousand people,"" he noted.
""How big?"" I asked, curious.
""Let's just say there's no shortage of people willing to invest in the endeavor. We'd also need to build a ship capable of carrying millions of people, and there are plenty of companies and private investors who are interested in participating,"" he said.
""A ship…carrying millions?"" I asked. ""I thought the first mission to Mars only carried a couple of dozen astronauts.""
""Those were test missions. We needed to make sure the technology worked before sending humans there permanently. Our current plan calls for launching a fleet of ships, each carrying thousands of passengers and cargo,"" he explained. ""Once the ships arrive on Mars, they'll unload their supplies and equipment then send the remaining passengers to the surface. They'll be joined by additional ships as the population grows over time.""
I shook my head, thinking it all seemed incredibly risky. ""If the colony fails, everyone dies,"" I pointed out.
""Yes, I suppose you're right,"" the president agreed. ""But we believe the risks are worth taking. Not only would it give us a second chance at life, but it could also pave the way for the expansion of human civilization beyond our solar system. After all, once we've established ourselves on Mars, there's nothing stopping us from exploring the rest of the galaxy. We'll be free to travel anywhere in the universe.""
I shook my head. ""That's a lot to ask of anyone. Even if the risk is worthwhile, it seems like it would take a significant amount of money to pull it off.""
""We already have a good chunk of the funding,"" the president replied. ""In addition to the investments I mentioned earlier, several major corporations and private investors have pledged to contribute. I just need you to get the word out and encourage others to join the cause.""
""I'll do what I can,"" I assured him. ""Though I imagine the president of the United States isn't the best person to be asking for donations.""
The president chuckled. ""You're probably correct,"" he admitted. ""But I've got a feeling you'll come up with a solution to that problem soon enough.",1192,-1.0242495536192537,-1.355206738245632,1.0338165386500064,1.0745721008771094,0.4229207957606849
7,R_1OTumnq5CvwErvT,MOR_HF_9,High Fantasy,Morpho,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. There was no sign of life.
""I hope they're friendly,"" said Dara.
""They have to be, right? Otherwise we're in trouble.""
""Why do you say that?""
""Well, we're trespassing in their territory.""
""So are they.""
""And I'm not talking about the elves. I'm talking about the dragons.""
""Why do you suppose they're here?"" asked Dara.
""They're here to protect the village.""
""From what?""
""From what it is.""
Dara studied the buildings and towers for a moment. ""I'm not sure what that means.""
""We'll find out soon enough,"" said Ryn. ""Let's go and see what we can find.""
They approached the village and found an empty patch of ground where they could sit and watch the area. Soon after, a dragon descended from the sky and landed on the shore of the lake. The dragon looked more like a lizard than anything else but it had scales all over its body and wings that extended from its back like a bat's wings. It was much larger than any dragon Dara had ever seen and she was surprised to see that it was just a hatchling. Its eyes were open but it hadn't yet learned to fly properly. More than once it crashed into trees or into the lake as it attempted to take off again.
It was too big to eat so Dara was a bit disappointed when it didn't even look at them as it made its way upriver.
""So much for them being friendly,"" said Dara.
""They were probably just curious about the new arrivals."" Ryn shrugged. ""Besides, they were the ones that invited us here.""
Dara frowned and watched as the dragon disappeared into the trees on the far side of the lake. ""You know we're going to have to cross that lake eventually, right?""
Ryn looked at her sideways. ""You want to swim across?"" He shook his head. ""No, I don't think so.""
""Me neither.""
They sat and watched for a while longer but nothing else of interest happened so they decided to move on to the next valley over. When they arrived there they found another large lake where a dragon hovered over a small island in its center. It had two heads, one on either side of its long neck, and when it looked up at them from where it stood at the edge of its domain, she saw that there were two large pairs of eyes staring back at her from each of its heads. It was a strange sight and she felt as if it could see through her very soul. Its eyes were dark and penetrating, yet somehow friendly, and she wondered if they were some kind of magic or if maybe dragons can see into your heart like she can when she looks into people's eyes. She wasn't sure how to react to the sight of such an unusual creature so she just stood there as if frozen in place, staring at it in silence until Ryn nudged her in the ribs and motioned for her to come on. She shook herself out of her stupor and followed him as he walked up to meet it. She was about to speak when she realized that the dragon's two heads were talking with one another in some kind of tongue she didn't understand, yet it seemed to be having an animated conversation about something or other. After a while, they both turned their heads toward Dara and Ryn and with a wave of his head, he beckoned them forward so that they might speak with him. As they approached, Dara could see that his skin was green and scaly like a lizard's but his scales were smooth and shiny with what appeared to be oil or some other liquid. His chest was covered in feathers which were plumed out like a peacock's tail, while his neck was covered with long, black spikes which extended up his back to a long neck full of even longer spikes which formed into a ruff around his head like an ornate hood or crown. His wings were long, slender and leathery with long spikes along their edges like a bird's claws, and at his sides he had four long legs covered in scales like a lizard's too, but these scales were more smooth and shiny than rough and scaly like those on his chest and back. They were also covered in feathers which gave them a sort of puffed up look. The scales on his belly were more dull than sharp like his wings and legs, and they extended down onto his tail which was covered in feathers too but also had long spikes protruding out from either side like a plumed tail. He was an odd looking creature but Dara found herself drawn to him anyway because he reminded her somehow of her father who had been killed by something very similar not too long ago by a dragon with two heads. She wondered if this one was responsible for her father's death as well but before she could ask him, he spoke for himself first.
""I am Hralien,"" he said in a voice full of confidence and power. ""I am called Hralien because I am one of the Hralien who guards this valley of Tethys."" Hralien turned his head away from them to look off into the distance where he could see another dragon flying toward him from over the mountains on the far side of the valley. ""I have been told that you are seeking information about where you might find your mother in Valdyr where I believe you might find those who would help you if you are prepared to pay for their services."" He paused expectantly, waiting for something from them but Dara didn't know what that something was supposed to be, so she just stared back blankly at him while Ryn frowned at him and crossed his arms over his chest in annoyance. Eventually, Hralien sighed and motioned for them to follow him back toward his home on the island where he told them they could rest for the night before making their way across Tethys once more to Valdyr if that was their wish. They followed him through thick undergrowth which was damp and humid, smelling faintly of earth and vegetation with just enough saltiness present in the air to remind Dara that they were on a lake somewhere near sea level, not far from water's edge. Their path led them through small groves of trees where Dara saw clusters of small white flowers growing under their branches while birds sang all around them in cheerful voices punctuated by loud screeches every now and then as they competed with one another for territory or food or mates or whatever it is birds do when there are no dragons about to keep them away from the humans who happen by. They reached Hralien's home eventually where he led them to a small clearing among tall trees with tall gray trunks standing like sentinels along either side of him as he approached a large tree with thick roots that extended down into mud beneath their feet where he stopped in front of it, then turned around and motioned for them to come closer so that they might hear him talk better where it wasn't so noisy out here in the forest away from his home.",1308,0.1860780400521737,-1.2157968098927856,-1.673089910261865,1.5777721487797376,0.5391316102451664
8,R_3e1fmK7yo3kaaYN,ALL_HR_4,Historical Romance,All-Nighter,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been watching the men playing cards and drinking ale, trying to keep from staring at the beautiful young woman who was sitting there with them.
She was so very beautiful. The red hair that hung down to her shoulders, the golden-brown skin of her face, those bright blue eyes—he couldn't take his eyes off of her. His breath caught as she looked up from her drink and smiled at him. She seemed to know he was staring, but it didn't matter to her; she just gave him a little wave before turning back to the conversation she was having with the others seated around her.
He tried not to stare at her, but he could tell the men were all talking about him, how they hadn't seen anything like it before. ""Look at that pretty boy,"" one man said. ""He can't even look away when that woman walks by."" Another laughed. ""No doubt he's a virgin, and she'll be his first. He won't have a chance to get her home without losing his heart.""
He wanted to laugh along with them, but he couldn't. The way she looked at him made his stomach hurt. It was almost as if she knew he was looking at her. When the women walked by, she would give him a little smile before turning back to her friends.
She came back the next day. The same thing happened. She looked up at him whenever she passed by, and he always had to force himself to look away. That night, though, he found himself staring again. Her hair was pulled up, and the light caught on it as she moved. Her long, white dress swished out behind her, making him think of the water in the bayou. She seemed to move more gracefully than any of the women he'd seen before, and the way her body moved made his blood race through his veins.
The next time she came in, he made sure to sit right by her table. It wasn't long before she caught on, and she smiled at him again. This time, when she saw him staring, she put a hand on his arm.
""You're staring at me,"" she said.
He blushed, embarrassed that he hadn't been able to stop himself from watching her. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""It's just... you're so beautiful.""
She laughed. ""Well, thank you, I suppose. You're not bad-looking yourself.""
He felt his face heat up. ""Thank you,"" he said.
She leaned forward, lowering her voice. ""My name is Marie, and yours?""
""I'm Patrick. Patrick O'Sullivan.""
Her eyes widened slightly. ""Patrick? Are you Irish?""
""Yes, my family lives near there."" He didn't know why he had told her that. It seemed like he should have known better.
""I've never met an Irishman before,"" she said. ""What part of Ireland are you from?""
""I'm from Cork, in the south.""
She smiled. ""That's a lovely place. My grandmother grew up there. We used to visit her when we were young, and I remember how beautiful it was. So green."" She turned her head back toward the others at the table. ""Did you say you work here?""
""I do,"" he said. ""I clean tables.""
She gave him a small smile. ""It looks like you're very good at it. Did you train for that?""
He nodded. ""I did.""
""Then I guess I'll see you again tomorrow.""
He watched as she got up from her seat. She walked over to the men who had been sitting with her and started talking to them. When she came back, he could see that they were all looking at her. He thought about leaving, but he couldn't bring himself to go. He knew if he did, he'd regret it. He sat there watching her while she talked, and after she left, he couldn't take his eyes off of her.
She came back two days later, and she had brought some of her friends with her. The way she looked at him made him blush. She laughed at him, saying he was always staring at her. He felt so embarrassed that he had no choice but to leave.
When she came back the next day, she saw him and smiled. This time, when she was done with the men who had come with her, she walked over to him. ""Patrick,"" she said. ""Would you like to go out with me?""
He nodded, too surprised to say anything. ""Yes, ma'am.""
She laughed. ""You don't seem to know much about the ways of the world."" She put her hand on his arm and looked into his eyes. ""I'm asking you to take me home tonight. You can spend the night with me, if you want to.""
He nodded. ""Of course,"" he said. ""That sounds wonderful.""
The smile on her face grew bigger. She turned away and walked back over to where the others were sitting. After she left, he went over to the other table. It wasn't long before the men who had been sitting with her were laughing at him again, talking about how a girl as beautiful as Marie would have no trouble finding someone to take her home. They made fun of him for wanting to go with her. One man said that Patrick didn't even know what kind of girl she was; he thought she was just an innocent little thing.
They started calling him the Irish virgin. They teased him that he would be lucky if she took him home, because they all knew she wouldn't. When he heard them, he couldn't help but feel bad. He'd never seen another woman before, and she had asked him out.
But it didn't matter. None of it mattered, anyway. All he could think about was going home with her, taking her in his arms and holding her there.
""Patrick?"" Marie's voice pulled him out of his thoughts.
He looked up. She was standing in front of him. He smiled at her. ""Yes, ma'am?""
""Would you like to come home with me tonight? We could go by carriage, if you would rather not walk.""
He shook his head. ""I don't mind walking. I'll see you tomorrow?""
She nodded. ""Yes, of course.""
He turned to go. Before he got out of sight, though, one of the men from the other table called out to him. ""Hey, Patrick!""
He turned around and looked at the man. ""What is it?""
The man laughed. ""Don't be fooled. She's a whore, just like the rest of them. She'll probably be in bed with ten other men by the time you get her home.""
He wanted to tell them that he was no such thing, but he kept his mouth shut. Instead, he walked away.",1159,1.5389412227912875,0.21681342808183957,0.6430758849853211,1.1558869934589049,1.4190851539877172
9,R_1iaEiZstGQv0gmP,ALL_HR_1,Historical Romance,All-Nighter,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He hadn't known she was there until she spoke to him. She'd said something about not being able to find someone. It had sounded as if it was an excuse. The truth of it was that he was afraid she wouldn't be able to afford to buy a drink from him, and so he'd given her his best price—one copper for the cheapest glass of wine in the house.
He'd thought it was generous; he'd never given anyone less than two coppers before. But then, he'd always had more money than he could ever spend. And yet she hadn't seemed to mind the price at all, just as if she were used to getting things for free.
And when he'd handed her the glass and told her how much it cost, he realized that she was beautiful. She looked like some kind of princess—she had a regal bearing about her. Her long blond hair fell in loose ringlets around her shoulders, and her green eyes glittered with intelligence. She wore a dress that was cut high on her chest, but low enough to show the shape of her hips and the curve of her breasts, and he'd nearly forgotten what he'd been thinking about before.
But when she'd taken her glass and left the room, he couldn't help remembering why he didn't want her to come back. She'd asked him how much a night would cost, and he'd told her that it was ten coppers for the cheapest room. Then she'd said, ""That's too expensive. I don't have ten coppers.""
He'd thought she was just being difficult. She seemed to think that nothing in the tavern was worth more than one copper, and so she had probably meant to say that she didn't have ten coppers, not that she couldn't afford it. He'd thought about taking the money from his own pocket—he always carried a small purse with him for such emergencies—but then he'd decided against it. It wouldn't have been fair, he'd thought, to take the money out of his own savings when she clearly had none.
But now she was here, in his room, asking for something even more expensive than the cheapest room in the inn. He knew better than to refuse her outright. There was no telling what she might do. If he did that, he would be forced to give her the room anyway—or worse.
""You can pay me tomorrow,"" he said. ""I'm not going to turn you away because I'm afraid you'll hurt my reputation.""
She laughed softly. ""My reputation isn't the only thing that will suffer if I don't get a bath tonight.""
He stared at her. She was wearing a dress made of some sort of light material that clung tightly to her body and revealed every curve. Her breasts were full and round, and her nipples were darkly colored. He could see them through the thin cloth of her dress. He tried to look away from her, but he couldn't stop staring at her.
""I'll be right back,"" he said, and hurried into his private bathroom.
It wasn't like him to be so bold with a woman he barely knew, but she had caught his eye and held it. She looked almost as if she belonged to royalty. And yet he had never seen anyone else who seemed quite so… ordinary.
He was still standing under the water when he heard the sound of the door opening again. He turned his head just enough to look over his shoulder, and saw her walking toward him.
She was wearing a different dress, this one cut low in front. He couldn't tell where it stopped and her skin began.
""Here,"" he said, taking the soap from his shelf. ""I'll wash your hair for you.""
She took the soap from him and smiled. ""Thank you,"" she said. Then she turned around, lifted her arms up, and bent her head forward slightly, exposing herself to him.
He felt his face flush with embarrassment. It wasn't that he hadn't seen naked women before; he had. But it was always with other men. The thought of being alone with a naked woman—especially a woman who was as beautiful as she was—made him uncomfortable. He was embarrassed that he had been caught staring at her like this, and he didn't want to give her any more reason to think badly of him than she already did.
But then she started to wash his hair, and he forgot about everything but her. She massaged the soap into his scalp gently, and he could feel her fingers sliding against his skin. She smelled good, like some kind of flowery perfume. And she kept looking up at him, as if she were trying to see whether he was enjoying what she was doing.
It made him uncomfortable, too, but in a different way. He wanted to tell her that he was enjoying himself, but he didn't know how to do that without seeming rude.
And then he realized that she was watching him very carefully. She wasn't looking at his face—he could tell because her eyes were fixed on his chest—but she was watching him very closely, as if she expected to learn something about him by watching him.
""How old are you?"" he asked her. ""You're not much older than I am, I think.""
She smiled at him, but it didn't quite reach her eyes. ""I'm older than I look,"" she said.
He looked at her face and saw that she wasn't joking. Her expression was serious, almost stern. ""I'm sorry,"" he said.
She shook her head. ""Don't apologize for asking me something you need to know."" Then she leaned closer to him and ran her hand over his chest. He felt the touch of her palm against his skin, and the sensation went all the way down to his groin.
She took her hand away from his chest, and he felt the loss of her touch like a physical pain.
""Are you married?"" she asked him.
He hadn't meant to say anything; he had been thinking of nothing more than getting her out of the room so he could finish his bath. But now he found himself responding to her question. ""No,"" he said. ""I'm not married.""
Her smile returned. ""I knew it."" She sat back against the side of the tub and folded her arms across her breasts, giving him a clear view of her nipples.
""I'm not gay,"" he said. ""I've just never… well, I don't want to be with a woman who is my wife.""
She laughed softly. ""I know,"" she said. ""But I'm not your wife. I'm just a young woman who needs a place to sleep tonight. You're an innkeeper, aren't you? Do you have a room for rent?""
""I do,"" he said, feeling a little uncomfortable about it. She wasn't someone he knew. And yet he wanted to give her what she was asking for.
""Good,"" she said, ""then we can go to my room.",1208,1.83135391231212,-1.4054770499769529,1.712887051987188,0.27149055441857883,0.8295686890130874
10,R_XO2XxlFvLFdAI3T,ACE_HSF_4,Hard Sci-Fi,Ace of Spade,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. As I walked toward the presidential palace, I saw a lot of people milling around near the plaza in front of it, but there were no protests or riots going on anywhere I could see. There had been some minor demonstrations when we first landed, but those had died down as word got out about our mission objectives.
When I arrived at the gate to the compound where the president lived, I was greeted by two soldiers who looked like they were ready for battle at any moment. They checked my credentials, then let me pass through. I followed the signs until I came upon a set of wide stone stairs leading up to the main doors. The guards stationed there eyed me suspiciously as I approached them. One stepped forward and handed me back my ID card without even looking at it, while the other opened the door so that I could enter. I made my way inside, past several more guards standing guard along the walls. They all saluted as I passed, but I just nodded politely back at them. I didn't know if they'd seen me in the news, and I certainly wasn't planning on talking to anyone. All I wanted was to get to the president's office and hand off the letter from him. Once that was done, I would be heading straight home to my wife.
The hallway beyond the guards' station was lined with paintings of former presidents, and the air was warm and dry. The walls were decorated with framed pictures of various national landmarks, including one large image showing what appeared to be the entire city of New York. A man in a suit sat behind a desk near the end of the hall, working quietly away at something. When he noticed me approaching, he stood up and extended his hand.
""Mr. Fletcher?"" he asked. He sounded surprised to hear my name come out of my mouth. ""You're not scheduled to be meeting with the president today, are you? Is there some kind of emergency?""
I shook my head. ""No, sir,"" I replied, taking his offered hand and shaking it firmly. ""Dr. Sato has brought me here to give you this letter from President Anderson.""
He accepted it gratefully, and pulled a pair of glasses from his pocket to read it quickly. After a few moments, he handed the note back to me and gestured toward a side room. ""Please follow me. We'll take care of this right away.""
We walked together into another corridor, passing a number of offices on either side, each one staffed with people sitting behind desks and staring blankly at their monitors. Finally, we reached a small conference room. Two men and a woman were seated around the table, looking very much like your standard middle management types. Their suits were impeccable, and they were all wearing dark blue ties. At least these guys weren't armed. The only person in the group who seemed to be paying any attention to us was the woman, a tall, thin blonde. She smiled as we entered and motioned to the empty chairs in front of the table. I sat down next to the president, leaving Dr. Sato to sit across from me. The others also gave us a nod as we sat down.
""This is Mr. Jones, Director of Operations, Mr. Carter, General Manager of the Colonies, and Ms. Henderson, Executive Assistant to the President."" The four of them introduced themselves as they continued to smile. ""Mr. Fletcher, please forgive us for having to bring you here under such short notice. Our schedule has been extremely busy lately, and I'm afraid that we've neglected to notify you properly of our plans for the future of Mars.""
They spoke so fast that I couldn't keep up with everything they said. What did they mean by neglecting to notify me? And why did they think I knew anything about the future of Mars? Wasn't that the whole point of landing humans on the surface of Mars in the first place? Why else would the government send astronauts there in the first place? I glanced over at Dr. Sato, trying to gauge her reaction, but she looked calm enough. Maybe she didn't realize that I knew nothing about their plan for Mars. But how could I possibly know? It hadn't been announced yet!
President Anderson cleared his throat and addressed me directly. ""As you may have heard, the colonization of Mars will be ending soon. This is due to budget cuts being proposed by the U.S. Congress, which would effectively put an end to the project altogether. As you can imagine, this is a difficult situation for us here at NASA, as we believe the colonization effort is vital to the long-term success of the human race. However, we don't feel that we have any choice but to make some adjustments in order to save money and ensure that the rest of our programs continue on uninterrupted.""
There was a knock on the door before I had time to respond. It slid open, revealing a young woman with red hair and a stern expression. She was dressed in a white lab coat, and carried a clipboard in one hand. Without saying a word, she walked into the room and took a seat beside me, crossing her legs in a very ladylike fashion. I stared at her in shock as everyone else turned to look at her. Her eyes darted around the table, stopping at every member of the team, as if memorizing their faces.
""Hello, Mr. Fletcher,"" she finally said. ""My name is Doctor Marie Laveau, and I am here to evaluate your mental state. You should understand that you're not under arrest, but that the evaluation process will require a certain level of cooperation on your part. Do you understand?""
She waited patiently, as I struggled to find the words to reply. Then, after a moment's thought, I realized that there was no way to refuse without causing a scene. So, I simply nodded my head, hoping that it would be sufficient. The doctor leaned forward slightly, and I could tell that she was studying me closely. I tried to ignore the fact that she was probably reading my thoughts. I wondered if they had given me any drugs to help me cooperate, or maybe they had implanted a chip into my brain to record my responses. Whatever they had planned, I hoped I wouldn't regret my decision.
""Very good. Please turn to page three of the letter and begin reading the first paragraph.""
I looked at the paper, then began reading: ""Dear Dr. Anderson, I wanted to let you know personally about the changes we are making to the colony. I hope to discuss them with you during my next visit to Earth. In the meantime, please let me assure you that our top priority remains the safety of the colonists. Thank you, President Anderson.""
I looked up and saw the doctor smiling. I couldn't tell if it was a genuine expression, or if she were just faking it to get me to go along with whatever they had in store for me. I started reading again, and a few minutes later finished the passage: ""I look forward to speaking to you again soon, and I wish you the best of luck with the upcoming elections. Your friend, Mark Fletcher. P.S. Please do not tell anyone of our plans to end the colonization efforts.""
After finishing the letter, I handed it to the president, who took it with shaking hands and read it carefully.",1335,0.785711754997455,-0.329520539899139,-0.006554241661672579,1.4563555082358708,0.4061395821149846
11,R_2fczC7qjIMURCcl,MOR_HOR_2,Horror,Morpho,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a woman's face, but it was also a face that had been melted by fire. She looked like a burn victim, but the face was still perfectly formed. The eyes were milky white and burned out. The rest of her face was charred black. I screamed and fell back into bed.
""Who are you?"" I shouted at her in the mirror. ""What do you want? Why are you here?""
""I'm here to kill you,"" she said.
""Kill me?"" I said back to her. ""Why would you want to kill me?""
""You're the one who called for me,"" she said. ""You're the one who killed my husband.""
""I didn't kill him,"" I said to the face in the mirror. ""I killed a man who killed him.""
""You're lying,"" she said to me. ""You killed my husband.""
""And how do you know that?"" I asked back at her. ""I don't know anything about you.""
""I know everything about you,"" she said. ""It was you who burned my family.""
""My family?"" I asked back at her. ""What are you talking about? I don't have a family.""
""You have a husband and two children,"" she said to me. ""You murdered them in their sleep.""
""How can you even know that?"" I asked back at her. ""I don't know any of that.""
""I know everything about you, Mr. Smith,"" she said to me. ""You're the one who killed my family.""
""You're crazy,"" I said to her in the mirror. ""That's not me. That's not my name.""
""You're lying to me,"" she said to me in the mirror. ""I know your real name. I know where you live. I know what you look like.""
""That's not true,"" I said back to her in the mirror, but I knew it was true. She knew all of that about me and she seemed to know it without being told.
""Look at yourself in the mirror,"" she said to me in the mirror. ""I'm not lying to you.""
""I don't have anything left,"" I told her in the mirror. ""I'm all alone now.""
""All alone? Not anymore,"" she said to me in the mirror, and I knew she was talking about me and not my family. ""I'm going to kill you, Mr. Smith.""
""That's not my name!"" I shouted back at her in the mirror, but she didn't seem to care about what my name was. She seemed more interested in killing me than anything else.
""What is your name?"" she asked me in the mirror.
""My name is John Smith,"" I told her in the mirror, but she didn't seem to care how my name was spelled either way.
""I'm going to kill you, John Smith!"" she shouted at me in the mirror, and then she screamed as though she had been stabbed in the chest by a knife. Her face distorted as though she were in shock or agony, and then her body began to melt away into a puddle of black smoke that floated up out of the mirror and then disappeared into nothingness.
I ran out of my bedroom and down into the living room where I saw that there were three charred bodies lying on the floor, one on top of another as though they were piled on top of each other, and they looked like they had been burned from head to toe by an awful fire that had destroyed their lives and their bodies at the same time. The bodies had been disfigured beyond recognition and there was no way any of them could have been one of mine or my wife's or our children's since they didn't look anything like us at all anymore, but there they lay on the floor just like that woman in that mirror had done only moments before, only these bodies had been burned beyond recognition and there was no way that any of them could have been one of mine or my wife's or our children's. They were just like those charred bodies that had once been a woman's body that had once been a man's body until they were burned beyond recognition and then disappeared into nothingness.",744,0.10193529640723535,-1.720264376931497,-0.7305503091795724,-2.05187419239863,-1.927426901570325

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
I walked to the bus stop outside, and took the first available vehicle that arrived. I had a couple hours until my appointment, so I figured I'd head out to the Red Planet for some sightseeing.
As usual, the bus didn't come for several minutes, but I was patient as I waited. Once it arrived, I got on, and settled in for the ride to the spaceport. The bus was small and cramped, and the seats were uncomfortable, but they did have an entertainment system that let you watch videos and listen to music while you were riding.
The trip lasted about an hour, and once we landed at the spaceport I exited and walked across to where my ship was docked.
I stepped up onto the gangway and walked down the steps into the ship. It was a little smaller than the one I had been on the last time I had been on Mars. I suppose if you want to go somewhere nice, you can't really afford to take a lot of things with you.
""Hello there."" I turned around to see the pilot who had brought me here standing behind me. ""You're looking for something?"" she asked.
""Yes, I am. My ship is in orbit right now, and I'm hoping to go out to Mars for the day.""
She looked at me for a moment and then nodded. ""Well, I could give you a lift to the surface if you'd like, or you can wait for a shuttle.""
""What are the conditions like out there today?"" I asked.
""It's about forty-five degrees Celsius out right now, with winds of about twenty kilometers per hour. Not too bad.""
I decided that since I only had a couple hours before I needed to be back, that I might as well get out there and enjoy the day.
""Give me a couple minutes, and I'll be ready,"" I said. She nodded and went back outside.
I grabbed my gear and put it in the lockers provided by the company that ran the transportation system on Mars. They had a pretty good service here. The shuttles were fast, and there weren't many delays.
After I had finished packing, I stepped out of the ship and went down the stairs into the main terminal building. There were people everywhere, and everyone seemed to be in a hurry.
I took my time getting through security and walking over to where the shuttle would leave from. Once I got there, I found a seat and sat down to wait. I was the only one there, so I figured I'd have a bit of peace and quiet while I waited.
The shuttle didn't take very long to arrive, and soon enough we were on our way to the surface. When we landed, I was the first off the ship, and I quickly made my way over to where the shuttle bus would depart from. It was a short walk, but the weather was nice, and the wind wasn't bad at all.
When I reached the bus stop, I saw Dr. Sato standing there waiting for me.
""Hey, I'm glad you decided to go,"" she said when I got close enough. ""Come on, we need to hurry if we want to make it to the president's office in time.""
She led me inside, and down a few corridors to where the president's office was located. We walked past several other rooms until we got there. The room itself was quite large, and it was lined with couches and chairs where people could sit and wait.
We stepped inside, and I saw that there were already three people sitting in the room. The two men had been talking when we walked in, but they stopped when Dr. Sato introduced us to them.
""Dr. Sato,"" said the older man who seemed to be the president of the colony, ""this is my aide, Mr. Gomes, and his assistant, Ms. Jones.""
They both nodded their heads as we were introduced. I noticed that Ms. Jones was a little younger than me. She had a pretty face, and her blonde hair was cut in a short style. Her body was slim, and she wore a tight fitting business suit.
""It's nice to meet you both,"" I said as Dr. Sato shook hands with the two men. ""I'm sorry we're late. Is everything alright?""
""Yes, no problem,"" said Mr. Gomes. ""You are here now, so let's get started.""
He looked over to me, and I sat down next to Ms. Jones.
""As you know, this is the first time that a representative from Earth has visited Mars in nearly ten years,"" he continued. ""The president feels that it is important that you be treated to a tour of our colony. This way you will have an opportunity to see firsthand what your government is doing here, and how we are faring as a group.""
""I think that would be very beneficial for me,"" I said. ""I've been here for a couple months now, and it's only going to be a matter of time before I need to report back to my superiors about what's happening here on Mars.""
""Then we'll make sure that you do,"" said Mr. Gomes.
""Well, I don't mind showing off my home to someone,"" said Ms. Jones. ""It might even help us to find more people like you.""
Mr. Gomes nodded, and then turned to me again. ""If you'll just go wait in the lobby, we'll be right there."" He stood up and walked out of the room.
I got up and followed him. The two women stayed behind, and soon after Mr. Gomes left, Ms. Jones spoke up.
""So, you're from Earth?"" she asked.
""Yes, I am. I'm a scientist working on a project down in Texas. It's pretty boring there, so I decided to take a vacation to somewhere a bit more exciting. That's where I met Dr. Sato.""
She looked at me, and then smiled. ""That must have been quite an experience, having the opportunity to meet her.""
I was about to ask her why she thought that, when I saw Mr. Gomes walking towards the door. I got up and walked with him until we were outside.
""You can come with me,"" he said as he led me to a waiting car. ""We'll get you set up and show you around before you go to meet the president.""
""What about Ms. Jones and Ms. Sato?"" I asked.
He shook his head. ""They'll be fine. We have security stationed around the building to make sure nothing happens while we're gone.""
""Alright then,"" I said as he opened the door for me.
I climbed into the back seat and waited as the driver got behind the wheel. When he was ready, the car pulled away from the curb and headed out towards the center of the city.
As we drove, I could see the buildings getting larger and taller as we moved farther and farther from the spaceport. There were some small shops here and there, but mostly this area seemed to be residential.",1250,0.8839274104150814,0.6044598105560037,0.2603701289768663,-0.15883928638059588,0.9657359100906445
13,R_0TXiNMLGRzorJtL,GEN_HR_4,Historical Romance,Genesis,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been working on cleaning up the beer spilled by some of the drunks who came in before closing. The girl's gaze had locked onto him as she sat there drinking what looked to be a cup of wine. A man stood behind her, a tall, handsome fellow with dark hair and bright eyes. For a moment he thought it might have been an escort, but when he spoke to the woman and turned his back to the room, Kip realized that this must be the mysterious stranger. The two were talking quietly. Kip heard only bits of their conversation. It seemed they were both searching for someone. When the man rose from his seat, the girl followed him out of the tavern without looking back at Kip or saying anything more to him.
This encounter had happened several weeks ago, but it still haunted Kip's dreams. He couldn't get the image of the woman out of his mind. Her long brown hair fell over her shoulders and down her back. His fingers itched just thinking about brushing through those soft strands. And her eyes—he could see himself buried beneath them for days. They were a pale gray color, almost silver.
Kip knew he was no good for anyone. He was not wealthy; he wore cheap clothes because he couldn't afford better ones. He wasn't particularly handsome. In fact, most people would probably describe him as plain. But he did have a certain charm. He was tall, strong, and quick-witted. He also had a great sense of humor. He didn't take life too seriously. People liked him. That's why his father had sent him here in the first place.
He rubbed his hands together nervously. It had been five years since he arrived in this city, and he hadn't found a job yet. But he didn't really care about that. What he wanted was to meet someone like the mysterious woman who'd walked into the bar. Not someone like his father or mother, whose marriages were miserable and ended in divorce. Or someone like his brother, who married the wrong woman and lived a joyless life. No, what Kip had been hoping for all these years was to find someone like the mysterious stranger from the tavern. Someone beautiful and smart and strong enough to stand beside him against everything.
At least he had met one person like that once. He had been twelve at the time, and her name was Cinda. She had loved animals like he did, and she had teased him mercilessly, even when they weren't alone. He remembered how her smile would light up the whole world around him. The way he felt when he saw her had made him feel as if nothing else mattered anymore.
So when he saw her again, sitting at the same table in the tavern, he was ecstatic. If she recognized him, he was sure he would lose his chance forever. He had to act quickly. He had to speak to her before she left. If he could get close to her, maybe somehow convince her that she should stay here with him, then perhaps he would finally have a chance to show her what life was supposed to be like.
""I'll buy you another drink,"" Kip said loudly.
She looked up at him, and her eyes widened slightly. ""Are you offering me a bribe?"" she asked in a throaty voice.
He grinned. ""No, I'm buying my friend a drink."" He pointed to the man standing next to her.
The man laughed. ""Not much of a friend if he won't buy me a drink, is he?""
Kip shrugged. ""Perhaps not. But he's a nice guy, so let him buy you a drink.""
The man smiled and nodded.
Cinda's eyebrows rose. ""You're not going to order anything?"" she asked.
He shook his head. ""Not tonight,"" he said. ""We've got work tomorrow. We need our sleep.""
She nodded. ""Well, thank you for your kindness. Maybe you should come by later.""
Kip gave her a big grin. ""I will,"" he promised. ""And I promise to spend every last coin in my pocket just to be with you.""
Cinda smiled back at him. ""Is that a promise?""
He nodded. ""It's a promise."" He leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek.
Her eyes lit up. ""Oh, very well!"" she exclaimed.
Kip took a deep breath, wondering if he would ever see her again after she had gone from the tavern. He glanced at his friend and tried to hide his disappointment.
But that night, the stranger returned to the tavern. She and her companion sat at a table in front of Kip, and they ordered drinks. Kip waited until the man was busy with another customer. Then he walked over to her and touched her hand.
""Hello,"" he said. ""Did you enjoy your drink?""
She pulled away, and her cheeks turned pink. ""Yes, thank you,"" she answered. ""Your friend was quite kind to offer. Thank you for coming to the rescue.""
He smiled. ""It was my pleasure.""
She looked into his eyes. ""I think you are very brave, coming to see me today. You aren't afraid of me?""
""Afraid? Of course not. Why would I be?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Do you know who I am?""
He shook his head. ""No, but I do know who you are. I don't believe we've met, but I can tell by your eyes.""
""My eyes?"" she asked. ""What does my eye color have to do with anything?""
He chuckled. ""I told you, I know who you are.""
She tilted her head to the side, studying him. ""How do you know who I am?""
His heart thumped in his chest, and he couldn't help but notice how her fingers moved lightly across her mouth as though she was imagining kissing him. ""Because you're the mysterious woman from the tavern.""
She blushed again. ""You mean … ?""
""Yes, the one who sat at the table in front of me.""
A flicker of embarrassment passed over her face. ""I'm sorry. I didn't realize you would remember us from such a short time ago. You probably think I'm some sort of strange lady who frequents taverns.""
""No, no! It's just that …"" He paused, trying to find the right words. ""It seems like I saw you somewhere before. Perhaps in a dream. That's all. Just a dream.""
She studied him carefully. ""Where did you see me before?""
He squirmed. ""In a dream.""
""You saw me in a dream?""
He nodded.",1127,1.1650600625885785,0.08614636025412192,-0.6523551011296715,-0.3373590283753458,0.8376028365114242

The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It looks peaceful here,"" said Aleph as he watched his companions take in their surroundings. ""Perhaps we've reached our goal.""
""Not exactly,"" said Leila as she looked back over her shoulder towards the tower that marked the entrance. ""I'd say this is definitely where we're meant to start though, if I had to guess.""
""Let's go inside then,"" said Aleph. He looked at the rest of them. ""Unless you lot want to just keep on walking around outside until the sun sets?""
They made their way into the town. The buildings were all stone and mortar, making it hard for the sun to penetrate into any interior spaces. They followed the main road down towards the lake. It wasn't very large but it was certainly wide enough for their party to walk abreast without bumping into one another. There was no noise except for the sound of birds chirping in the trees overhead, and even the breeze that rustled the leaves could barely be heard.
""What do you think these people do for fun?"" said Aleph as he walked ahead of the group. He stopped and turned around. ""We haven't seen anyone about, have we? It's awfully quiet.""
Aleph couldn't help but laugh at his own words. They weren't at all quiet – the whole world around him felt eerily still, like a doll's house made from stone. It was as though the air itself was holding its breath.
""No,"" said Leila after a moment's hesitation. ""I don't think so.""
The silence that settled upon them didn't last long, but when it did the people seemed to suddenly come to life. Children ran out of nowhere, yelling and laughing. Mothers and fathers with small children were carrying buckets of water from the lake or setting them down beside the houses, or perhaps taking them to the edge and showing them how to paddle and dive. They all looked at the party as they passed by. All of them wore simple homespun clothing and seemed to be making an honest living, albeit a simple one. No one asked the newcomers anything or called out to them in greeting, nor did any of them say anything as the strangers walked on. The only ones to react were the children, and for that the others were thankful.
""It's probably best not to stick out too much,"" said Leila, breaking the silence as they continued their journey. ""They're probably used to seeing travelers pass through.""
They made their way down towards the lake shore. A sandy beach ran alongside a narrow path that led off to the right. It wound up one of the mountainsides to disappear around the corner. From where they stood it appeared to be a well-trodden trail, perhaps one the children played on.
Aleph frowned. ""This is odd. There's no reason for the path to run this way."" He reached out and picked a stone from the ground. He studied it closely before tossing it back into the dirt. ""I can't imagine anyone would go up there. It's almost completely vertical.""
He looked around at his companions. They all seemed equally perplexed.
""Let's keep going,"" said Aleph. ""I think it'll be quicker if we follow the path.""
As they began to walk along the beach, they came across an old man sitting on a stool by the waters' edge. The breeze was cool against Aleph's face but there was nothing in the water to warrant the temperature difference. It must have been the heat that had driven him away from it.
""Good day, sir!"" called Aleph as they drew closer. The man looked up at them without moving. His eyes were glazed over and he seemed unaware of their presence.
Aleph stopped and stared down at him. ""What is your name?""
The old man didn't respond.
""Do you live here?"" asked Aleph. The old man remained silent. ""Are you waiting for someone to come and fetch you? Are you a fisherman?""
Still no response.
""We're just passing through,"" said Aleph. ""We were wondering if you could tell us how long we've been gone?""
He turned and looked back at his companions. All of them stared at the old man with an equal degree of puzzlement and fear.
Aleph looked back at the old man one last time, then walked towards him. He took two more steps, then reached out and placed a hand on the old man's shoulder. The stranger still did not react.
Aleph frowned as he stepped closer to him.
""What is it, my friend?"" called Aleph. ""Tell me what you are. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.""
He could barely hear his own voice over the sound of the wind blowing past them. His companions didn't seem to notice anything was amiss.
""Aleph,"" called Leila, ""do you need something from this man?"" She was the first to speak. ""Perhaps he's ill.""
Aleph ignored her and kept walking, drawing nearer until he could smell the stench of the stranger's breath. When he saw the man's lips move, he pulled his head away and nearly vomited in disgust. He put both hands on the old man's shoulders, then began to shake him gently.
""Hello? Can you hear me?""
Nothing.
Aleph gave a frustrated sigh. He started to pull on the old man's arms, trying to lift him up. When that didn't work he put both hands around his waist and began to haul him back towards the others. As the stranger's body began to rise into the air, Aleph suddenly felt the ground begin to shift beneath his feet. His skin began to tingle as if all the life had been sucked from it. All the color drained from the world and a sharp, agonizing pain cut through his mind.
He could not move.
""Aleph!"" shouted Leila, rushing towards him. ""Are you okay?""
He tried to speak, but all that came out of his mouth was the word 'no'.
She looked around, seeing nothing amiss with their surroundings.
""Aleph,"" she said again, her voice full of panic. ""What's wrong?""
It took a moment for his vision to clear and the pain to cease.
When it did, he saw Leila standing next to him. He looked over at his companions, who were staring back at him. They all seemed stunned, as though they couldn't believe what they had seen.
Leila stepped closer, concern on her face. ""Aleph?""
""I'm sorry,"" he managed to say. ""I should have warned you.""
She frowned. ""Warned me about what?""
Aleph glanced over her shoulder. The old man had disappeared. A faint breeze blew past them, but there was no trace of him in the water or along the shores.
Aleph turned his attention back to Leila, whose expression had turned from curiosity to confusion.",1204,0.3041063651754896,-0.4906974634557535,0.35947444558569935,0.44693974204667924,0.19160124444924975
15,R_3DvGVlEJlR5tKj2,ACE_HF_10,High Fantasy,Ace of Spade,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They rode down toward the lake where the water sparkled under the afternoon light.
""What do you think?"" Ryl asked his companions as they dismounted. ""Should we head back? I don't know what we're going to find here."" He looked around nervously at the empty village and the still waters of the lake.
""I'm not sure,"" Alara replied. ""But this is definitely not the place that I expected. There are no signs of struggle, no bodies, nothing that would suggest there had been any violence. This could just be an abandoned village; however, I have never heard of such a thing before. It's possible that there's something else going on here that we haven't yet figured out.""
""Or maybe it's simply too early in the day to tell anything about them,"" Zera suggested. She walked her horse down to the shoreline. ""This looks peaceful enough."" She pointed out towards the center of the lake where a small island stood alone.
Ryl couldn't see any sign of anyone on the island but he did notice that the surface of the water rippled slightly as if someone were moving about on the other side. As he watched, a figure emerged from beneath the waves and swam to the shore. The woman climbed out of the water, shook off the last few drops and then began walking across the grassy plain toward the village. When she reached the edge of the forest line, she paused for a moment and then disappeared inside the woods.
Alara stepped forward and spoke in a low voice. ""That seems strange to me.""
Zera shrugged. ""It may be nothing, but I will keep my senses open for anything that might prove otherwise."" She nodded toward the woods. ""I'll take point while we investigate.""
She kicked her heels against her mount and led the way into the trees.
As they moved deeper into the forest, the sounds of birds and animals filled the air. Their path wound between two large boulders until finally reaching a small clearing. Here, they stopped and listened. From somewhere deep within the trees, they could hear the soft sound of a river running through the ground below them. Zera motioned for them to wait and then took a few steps farther into the clearing. After listening intently, she returned to them. ""There is definitely a stream nearby. We should try to follow it upstream so that we can get a better sense of the area.""
They continued following the river upstream until it met another small creek. At first, they followed the banks downstream but soon found themselves traveling directly alongside the smaller tributary. It wasn't long before Zera spotted something sticking out of the water ahead. She pulled her bow from her shoulder and nocked an arrow. ""Stay close and watch your step,"" she said quietly before drawing the string back.
Her aim was true and she shot straight through the floating object without hitting anything else. When she lowered her weapon, Ryl saw a dark-haired young man lying face down in the water. He quickly scanned the bank above him and saw several more bodies scattered among the brush. Each one appeared to be unconscious but breathing normally.
""We've got to move fast,"" Alara whispered. ""If they wake up, they will be a problem.""
The three of them silently made their way closer to the nearest body. With only a few feet separating them, the man opened his eyes and looked directly at them. His mouth dropped open in shock when he recognized Zera.
""Get away from her!"" he shouted, scrambling to his feet. He pulled a dagger from his belt and started making his way toward her.
Without thinking, Ryl reached behind him and grabbed the hilt of his sword. He brought it around quickly, knocking the blade from the man's hand. Before he could react, Ryl drove his elbow backward into his stomach. He fell back onto his rear end, gasping for breath.
""You are dead,"" he gasped, looking up at Ryl with hatred in his eyes.
Zera raised her bow again, preparing to shoot him again but Ryl held up his hand, stopping her. ""He is not our enemy,"" Ryl told her calmly.
Before either of them could respond, a loud howl erupted from the opposite side of the clearing. The four men who had been watching the scene unfold now charged toward them. In less than a heartbeat, their weapons were drawn and ready. Ryl readied his sword, trying to decide which direction to go.
""Leave this place, or die!"" the leader screamed, advancing on them with his sword in front of him.
Ryl didn't hesitate. He ducked under the man's swing and swept the blade upward, cutting deep into his arm. As he turned back to meet the charge, Ryl felt the sting of steel against his cheek. He spun around to block another blow but the man had already thrown his sword aside and taken hold of Ryl's arm. Ryl twisted sideways, forcing the attacker's blade to slide past his own. He then used the momentum to spin around and slam the man's wrist against the ground. With a quick twist of his hips, he threw the man over his head. The man landed hard on his back with a thud.
The second man was coming at Ryl now, swinging wildly at him with the same short sword that the leader had been wielding. Ryl parried each of his strikes effortlessly and then thrust his blade into the man's chest. He let go of his opponent's throat as he fell back to the ground.
Ryl looked around, searching for the next attacker. There were two of them left standing, both armed with swords. They backed away slowly, keeping a wary eye on him.
""Why are you here?"" one of the men asked, his tone showing little respect or fear.
""Where are you going?"" the other added.
""Back to the village. That is where we're supposed to be.""
""That's where we're going too. We are not afraid of you.""
""Well, I am. I have a wife and children that need me. I'm going home.""
""Not without us.""
""You want to come with us?""
""Yes, I do.""
""Then fight me like a real warrior.""
The men exchanged a look before rushing at him together.
Ryl barely had time to bring his sword around before they attacked. Both blades slashed across his torso, slicing flesh and leaving shallow cuts. Without missing a beat, Ryl countered with a slash of his own. He caught the man's blade on the downward stroke and knocked it out of position. He followed this attack by sweeping his leg, catching the other man in midair and sending him crashing to the ground.
As Ryl prepared for the third man's assault, he noticed that there were no more bodies in sight. ""Did you kill everyone?""
""No, they ran when we killed the others.""",1232,1.1696444305315818,1.4227092088319773,0.2740271490183596,1.5720803936977723,1.6507492151981693
16,R_1ob7H7Qz7CeIVhA,FAN_HSF_4,Hard Sci-Fi,Fandango,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The short days had been a shock when I first arrived, but with the time difference, they were actually shorter than what I was used to.
I walked down the street to my apartment complex, where I lived with the other research team members at Site 19. A small building surrounded by a low wall, it was one of four similar ones, housing about forty people. They were mostly researchers or support staff, though I knew a few of them were military as well.
Once inside the complex, I took the elevator up to the top floor, then walked through the double doors to the right, where Dr. Sato's desk sat next to a window. A woman stood behind it, talking on the phone. When she hung up, Dr. Sato got up and came around, shaking my hand warmly, like old friends.
""How are things going?"" she asked.
""Good,"" I replied. ""Just finished a presentation that went quite well.""
""I'm glad to hear it,"" she smiled. ""The president would like us to meet in his office at three o'clock. I've just finished setting up the meeting; if you'd like to grab something to eat while I get everything ready?""
I nodded, so she led me into the kitchen, where two others were already seated around the table. One was a young man who was probably in his late twenties, with short brown hair and an athletic build. He smiled at me when he saw that I was there, introducing himself.
""I'm Alex, the head of the security team on site,"" he said. ""Welcome.""
""Thanks,"" I replied. ""This is Sam, our resident artist.""
""Nice to meet you,"" he said. Then he looked at Dr. Sato. ""I heard you're recruiting more scientists.""
Dr. Sato nodded. ""Yes, we are! I'll be putting out some requests later today, once everyone else gets back in from lunch. Are either of you interested?""
""Not really,"" said Alex. ""We both work with the president directly; he likes us close by in case he has any questions.""
""Oh,"" said Sam. He didn't look happy about it, but then again, he didn't seem overly friendly either. I guess he was just reserved. ""Well, I'm interested in the art part, if that works out. We have some stuff coming up that needs painting.""
The last person there was a man about my age who worked on the research side of things. His name tag read Raul.
""Raul and me, we're the only nonmilitary folks on site,"" Alex said, looking at the newcomer, who nodded politely.
""It's nice to meet you!"" I smiled. ""I'm Sam Cooper.""
He shook my hand. ""I'm Raul Martinez.""
""I know,"" I grinned. ""I was hoping I'd see some familiar faces since I've been here for a while."" I looked at Dr. Sato, who just gave me a smile and a nod.
After we got up to leave, Dr. Sato told the three of them to go ahead and continue with their lunch, so she could put together an agenda. Alex and Raul walked outside to eat, which left Sam and I alone in the kitchen. While he ate, he kept glancing at me. I noticed that he didn't speak much, so I let him do the talking.
""So, are you from here originally?"" he asked.
""Nope,"" I said. ""I'm from the United States, which is why I don't pronounce all the words like everyone else does."" That seemed to please him. ""Where are you from?""
""Here,"" he said. ""Born and raised.""
""Really? You seem pretty different from the rest of us.""
He shrugged. ""Everyone's always like that; even with all of the military personnel here, we still get weird looks sometimes. Like when you walked into the room.""
""Yeah, I noticed."" We shared a momentary grin.
""You like art?"" he asked me.
""Sure. Why wouldn't I?""
""I dunno,"" he said. ""All of the other researchers that came in before you, they're into the heavy stuff; all about the science. None of them have ever shown any interest in art, or painting or drawing. Maybe you're not really a researcher at heart.""
""Is that what I'm supposed to be?"" I asked.
He laughed. ""No, no, just teasing. I think your parents just wanted you to be a doctor because the pay's better.""
I shook my head, laughing as well. ""You're funny, you know that?""
""I mean it,"" he said seriously. ""That presentation you did yesterday... I wish I could've seen it.""
When it came time to leave, I followed Dr. Sato down the hall, leaving Sam behind. We stopped at the front office, which was also the entrance to the president's office, and she went inside for a few minutes. When she came out, I noticed that Alex and Raul were nowhere to be found. We headed in, and I was surprised to see the president sitting behind the desk, reading over some papers.
""Hello, Dr. Cooper,"" he said. ""Please, take a seat."" Then he pointed to the chair on the opposite side of the desk. When I looked at Dr. Sato, she told me to go ahead, so I sat down. ""Now, let's talk about your presentation.""
""My presentation?"" I wasn't sure why he was asking; it had been over a week ago, after all.
""Yes,"" he smiled. ""We have a lot of people who watched it; it was very informative.""
He picked up a paper, then handed it to me, explaining, ""This is the feedback we've gotten from the viewers. Some of it's negative, but for the most part, they found it very beneficial.""
""Oh, okay."" It was interesting to see the results; some of it made me feel a little sad, but at least I knew they all agreed with me. I took the paper and put it in my bag, along with the envelope from Dr. Sato. They were just extra things I'd brought, in case I needed a snack.
The president nodded at me, then got up and came around the desk. He extended his hand. ""Sam, would you mind joining us?""
I stood up as he reached for it. ""Of course.""
He turned back to me. ""I'm sorry, I'm not sure if you've met each other yet, but this is Sam.""",1102,-0.6456615979913027,-0.5136315537768145,0.19035703451892036,1.1974137970883842,-1.5457337700290952
17,R_8GPni0ZCmVT9NSh,GEN_HF_5,High Fantasy,Genesis,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It's an idyllic place,"" said Rufra. ""A perfect place for us to meet."" He waved his hand at the water. ""Can't you just feel that calmness?""
""I can see why they chose this spot,"" said Laith.
Rufra had decided to show them the way himself. He was pleased they were so willing to follow him and hoped he would not regret it later. He could have used one of his men, but if he did, they might ask questions about where he'd been. If he stayed ahead of them, then no one need know what had happened since he last saw them.
He walked down to the edge of the water, looking back at his warriors as they followed. They looked eager now, faces alight with excitement. Maybe it was because of what they'd seen in the hills outside the city, maybe it was because of Rufra himself. Either way, there was little doubt that they believed they were going to win this war.
""What do you think they'll be like?"" said Jula.
Laith made a face. ""I don't know. I've never met people who live in such a place. It seems almost magical.""
""We won't judge them by their surroundings,"" said Rufra. ""They will still be people, just like us. We are all the same under our skins. What we choose to reveal is another story.""
Jula nodded her agreement. She turned away and watched the villagers, hoping she could get a glimpse of the women who lived there.
""Do you really think the king will listen to us?"" said Laith.
Rufra smiled. ""Who knows? But he has to make decisions based on facts, not just stories told by people who want something. Will you tell me the truth about what happened to the man you killed?""
Laith shrugged. ""He was going to kill me. He tried first but missed. Then he went for my friends. I'm sorry, but it wasn't your fault. You couldn't have known. And even if you had seen it coming, how would you have stopped him? I wouldn't have.""
Rufra looked at him, trying to work out if Laith was telling the truth or whether he was hiding something. In the end, he decided it didn't matter. If his plan worked, he would soon enough be dead anyway.
""There's nothing we can do about it now,"" he said. ""Let's talk about other things. Did you catch anything last night?""
""Yes, thank you,"" said Laith and pointed to the fish laid out on the ground between them.
""I thought you only caught a few?""
""No, I caught more than that. There's no point giving you them though. You're too big. Besides, I ate them all myself. I am a growing boy after all.""
""You certainly look it,"" said Rufra, but he didn't say anything else. He felt uncomfortable asking Laith about his hunting prowess, but he needed the information.
Laith went on to explain how he'd used a spear to snare birds in flight, then caught fish with his hands. He'd also found a herd of sheep and, once he was sure they were alone, he'd run among them, knocking them over and trampling them until he'd killed several.
""So, I think we should go to the river and see what we can find there,"" said Rufra, glancing up at the towers above the village. He knew they had to meet King Lebannen at some point, but he couldn't see any obvious place to stand and wait. ""If the king doesn't come down to meet us, then we can try to sneak inside the tower. That will give us time to plan how to deal with him.""
""How does sneaking in sound to you?"" said Laith.
Rufra grinned. ""Come on then, let's go.""
Laith picked up the basket of fish and put it on top of the pack he was carrying.
Rufra glanced back at his warriors, and they moved quickly to form a line. They were a strange-looking group; tall for men, broad around the shoulders, well muscled arms, but short legs. Some had long hair tied back in a ponytail while others wore their hair loose. Their clothes were varied, some brightly coloured, others plain browns and greens.
When they reached the riverbank, Rufra stopped and stared at the water.
""Why are we stopping?"" said Laith. ""I thought we were going to steal something.""
""I thought we might,"" said Rufra, ""but I've changed my mind. I need to think.""
Laith looked at him curiously. ""About what?""
Rufra turned to him. ""If I'm going to die, then I want to take the best things with me, the ones that mean the most to me. First, I want these."" He picked up the bow, strung it, and then handed it to Laith. ""Then I want to take this."" He held out the sword. ""And finally, this."" He pulled the dagger from his belt. ""For me, those are the important things.""
Laith took the bow and the sword, and carried them both on his shoulder. The dagger Rufra slipped into his own belt.
""I know it's not very wise to carry weapons when we're meeting royalty,"" said Rufra. ""But I don't intend to surrender them.""
Laith laughed. ""Maybe you should tell the king that before he kills you. Perhaps you can trick him into thinking you're an ally. You know, 'Your Majesty' and all that. You can even offer him friendship and peace, although I doubt he'll believe you.""
Rufra shook his head. ""I don't want to fool him. I want to scare him. When he sees that I have friends, and that they mean him harm, he will come down to meet us. We'll make our plans then.""
Laith opened his mouth to speak again but Rufra placed a finger to his lips.
""Now, let's go.""
Rufra led them to the edge of the water. He was tempted to jump in, but he knew he'd never reach the other bank. Instead, he stepped onto a rock and looked into the water.
""Have you ever seen anything like this?"" he asked.
Laith shrugged. ""No. Is it safe to walk on the rocks?""
""Yes,"" said Rufra, ""it is. Don't worry. Do you know which direction we should go?""",1115,-0.704126769399167,-1.4059687741772977,-1.079772319669865,0.14489273943944822,-0.5861525806866782
18,R_3qKJRWlKmpVXFni,GEN_HOR_7,Horror,Genesis,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a man who had been sleeping in my bed. He looked dead. His eyes were staring straight through me, as if he wasn't even seeing me. The man's hands were covered with blood, and I could see that his neck was cut.
""What are you doing?"" I asked him. ""What happened to you? Where is your shirt?""
The man started coughing up blood. He didn't answer me. He just stared through me, blankly. Then he passed out and fell down onto the floor. I went to pick him up, but when I did, the bloody hand was still holding mine. I had to let go of him because it hurt too much.
I ran downstairs and yelled for my mother, asking her what was going on. She came running out and saw the man lying on the floor. That scared her. She screamed, ""Oh my God!"" and then she started crying.
""Get away from him! Get away from him!"" she said. ""Don't touch him!""
My father came running down the stairs and picked the man up off the ground. He carried him outside and laid him next to the house. My parents told me not to go near the man again. They called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. I watched them put him in the ambulance while my mom cried.
When they took him away, I knew something bad was going to happen to our family. I couldn't get the image of the man's bloody hand out of my mind. I kept thinking about the way he grabbed my hand. I imagined his fingers digging into my skin and tearing it apart. I had nightmares all night long.
After that, my dad wouldn't leave the house for more than a few minutes at a time. He stayed home all day, and he slept most nights. My mom would tell me stories about ghosts and demons coming out of mirrors like that one. She said those things were evil and they wanted to kill us or make us do bad things.
One morning, I woke up to find my dad standing over my bed. He was breathing hard and shaking. ""They're here,"" he said. ""They're watching us.""
I stood up, scared. ""Who's 'they'?"" I asked him.
He pointed across the room to the wall where we hung our clothes. There was a black hole in the wall. A crack had opened up in the drywall. I could see people inside. They were wearing gray robes. Their faces were hidden behind masks. They made no sound.
""There are only two ways out of this house,"" my dad said. ""You either have to climb up the side of the mountain, or you can go through the door.""
I looked at the hole in the wall. It was about eight inches wide by ten feet long. I'd never seen anything like it before. My dad reached inside of it, and then he pulled his hand out. It was dripping wet. He held it in front of my face.
""Do you know what happened to this?"" he asked me.
I shook my head.
""It was inside of the wall,"" he said, pointing at the hand. ""And now it's outside of the wall. Do you understand?""
I nodded.
He started laughing, and then he started crying. He wrapped his arms around my shoulders and hugged me tight. ""We'll be okay,"" he whispered in my ear. ""Just don't go anywhere.""
I went back to sleep.
Later that day, I went into the bathroom and found blood all over the floor. I ran into the kitchen, and my dad was sitting at the table, eating lunch.
""Why are you bleeding?"" I asked him.
He laughed and wiped his mouth. ""I'm fine,"" he said. ""Now eat your food. You need to stay strong.""
That night, I woke up again to hear knocking on glass. This time, I felt someone standing right behind me. I turned around, and there was the man from the mirror. His face was covered by a mask, but I could see blood pouring down the side of his head. When he spoke, it sounded like a whisper.
""You killed him,"" he said. ""And now I'm going to kill you.""
As he walked toward me, I saw the bloody hand reaching for me.
""Stop!"" I yelled. ""Leave me alone!""
I pushed myself against the wall and slid down it. I watched as the man's hand touched my arm and tore it open. I screamed, but I didn't have any air left to scream with. I just closed my eyes and waited for death to come.
Then I heard a loud noise and the smell of hot metal filled my nose. A bright light flashed in front of my eyes, and then everything went dark.
I woke up in a hospital bed. My dad was sitting beside me.
""How are you feeling?"" he asked.
I tried to say something, but nothing came out. My throat was so raw.
""Are you in pain?"" he asked again.
I nodded.
""Good,"" he said. ""Because if you weren't, I'd beat the shit out of you.""
I smiled. I could feel the stitches pulling at the top of my forehead. I looked down at my arm. It was bandaged in white gauze. On the back of my hand was the word ""LUCKY"" written in black ink.
My dad laughed and patted my leg. ""You're lucky you're alive,"" he said.
I was happy to hear him say that. I felt like I finally had a chance to start over again. I wasn't going to be afraid anymore. I was going to learn how to fight and protect myself.
I didn't want anyone else to die, even if it meant killing them.

19,R_3EGYqG6RDlgjkag,MOR_HF_2,High Fantasy,Morpho,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is where we'll be staying,"" said Ayla.
""I see it,"" said Ithamar. ""It looks like a nice place.""
""You've never been to the Vale before?"" asked Ithamar.
""No, but I've heard of it,"" said Ayla. ""There's a great many fables about it.""
""I think I know why,"" said Ithamar, looking at the village. ""It looks very much like the Vale of the Silver Birch.""
""Exactly,"" said Ayla. ""But I'm certain it's not the same."" She looked around at the empty village and her expression changed. ""There's no one here.""
""There's no one here,"" said Ithamar. ""You're right, Ayla. It isn't the Vale of the Silver Birch.""
""It does look similar,"" said Ayla, ""but it doesn't feel the same."" She paused and then she smiled. ""It feels like home.""
""Then this is where we are going to stay,"" said Ithamar.
Ayla nodded and smiled as she started down the road that led down to the lake. The two young people followed behind her and before they reached the lake they saw a large stone building sitting near its shore. They approached it cautiously and when they reached the door they could see that it was closed and locked.
""Halt!"" shouted a voice from within.
Ithamar and Ayla stopped in their tracks and turned around to face the door of the building. The voice was coming from within and they stood there for a moment before looking at each other for guidance.
""It's probably just a traveler who doesn't know which way to go,"" said Ithamar. He smiled at Ayla as he started toward the door, but she took his arm and stopped him. She looked at him with concern in her eyes and he understood how she felt. He had been inside a strange place once before and he remembered how he felt when he had been there.
""I'm sorry for this,"" she said, looking at him with tears in her eyes, ""but I don't want to go inside.""
Ithamar squeezed her hand and then took her hand in his as he followed her back to a spot on the road where they could talk in peace. He knew she meant well but he realized that she was terrified of being inside the building. He didn't blame her for it. It was exactly how he had felt when he was there. He felt a lump in his throat at the thought of entering the building and going back into that place that had once been his home. The lump in his throat grew larger when he remembered that he had left his parents there and that they might be dead by now.
He looked at Ayla with concern in his eyes as he asked her, ""Are you all right?""
Ayla nodded and said, ""Yes, I'm fine."" She looked away from him as if embarrassed by her reaction.
""What's wrong?"" asked Ithamar.
Ayla closed her eyes and said, ""I don't know how to explain it, but it's like a part of me knows that this place is where I belong."" She looked back at him as she continued, ""Not that I want to go inside,"" she added hastily, ""but it feels like I'm supposed to be here.""
Ithamar looked at her and could see that she was genuinely scared of going into the building so he took her hand again and led her forward to where the door was standing open. He pulled her inside and shut the door behind them before looking at her with concern in his eyes. She looked at him with a worried expression on her face as she said, ""It's okay, I can take it from here.""
""Are you sure?"" asked Ithamar.
Ayla nodded and then turned around to look at him as he said, ""I want you to stay here with me while we go into the building."" He saw a look of fear on her face as she nodded again so he put his hand on her shoulder and said, ""Don't worry; this is for your own safety."" He smiled as he added, ""If things get too bad, you can always run out the door,"" he said, pointing toward the open doorway at the far end of the room.
Ayla nodded but she didn't say anything else as they walked down the long corridor that led away from the entrance hall. It was clear to Ithamar that they were headed toward what he thought might be a dining hall for travelers who had come to stay at the Vale for a while. The walls were covered with paintings that depicted scenes from different parts of Orëska history, but as they passed a painting of warriors fighting against giants in what looked like a forest, Ayla began to look around nervously while clutching his hand so tightly that her nails dug into his palm like razors.
A few moments later they reached another door and Ayla stopped walking as she asked, ""What's wrong?"" She looked up at Ithamar with concern in her eyes as she added, ""They're coming!""
""Who?"" asked Ithamar in alarm as he saw what looked like soldiers approaching through an open doorway just ahead of them.
""They're coming! They're coming!"" repeated Ayla hysterically as she tried to get away from him but he pulled her back against him so that she was forced to walk beside him instead of turning around to run away. She looked at him with a frightened expression on her face as she demanded, ""What are they?""
""I don't know,"" said Ithamar, trying not to look back at them until he heard them speaking Orëska Aramaic which told him that they were soldiers of some kind. He thought about trying to kill them if things got really bad but didn't see any other option if this was going to work so he just tightened his grip on Ayla's hand and followed behind them while keeping an eye on them in case they decided to attack them from behind or turn around suddenly while they were still looking forward or ahead of them. They walked down another corridor for several minutes before reaching yet another door which stood open for them to walk through into a large room filled with tables and chairs where several people were sitting around eating their meals while talking among themselves or watching an old man who sat in a chair in front of them playing a harp that he held between his knees while singing an old song about someone who had died a long time ago. The song made Ayla look away from Ithamar as if she were ashamed for listening to it while walking through this room full of people who were eating and talking together so that she couldn't help hearing what they were saying about her and about what had happened to them both in their lives before they had met each other only a few days ago on the road leading into this valley.
After they left the dining hall through yet another open doorway, they were walking down another corridor when Ayla stopped walking again because she could hear voices coming from behind them coming from another room ahead of them which held several people sitting around several tables talking among themselves while eating their meals or watching two young women who were talking while walking toward them down another corridor while holding hands with one another in front of them.",1318,-0.7706022809722828,-0.7571040882613077,-0.4005876938525304,-0.6019876201051019,-0.7028072194949585
20,R_3lzcgfJIzfAvwxK,MOR_HSF_2,Hard Sci-Fi,Morpho,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I thought about the president while I walked down the stairs and onto the street, heading toward the center of town to meet up with my crew.
I had been a little nervous about going to the president's office when I got this message from Sato, but I knew that it was only because he had summoned us. I had been waiting for this moment for a long time. I had been trying to get the attention of all of the people on Mars, but that was impossible. The president was the only one with enough power to call me in.
""I'm sure that he's going to ask you about my research,"" Sato said as she followed me down the stairs and out of our apartment building. ""He is very interested in it.""
""I'll answer his questions,"" I replied, ""but I'm not going to tell him anything.""
""Why not?"" she asked. ""You've devoted your life to this.""
""It's not my research that he wants,"" I said. ""It's me.""
""What do you mean?"" she asked.
""It's a long story,"" I said. ""I'll tell you once we've met with him.""
""You do realize this means you won't be able to do your research here anymore, don't you?"" she asked. ""I'm surprised that you're willing to give up your project for a meeting with him."" It was clear that she wasn't happy about this.
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I've been waiting for a chance like this for a long time now. If it means I'll be able to go back to Earth, then I'm all for it.""
""What if he doesn't want you to go back to Earth?"" she asked. ""What if he wants to keep you here on Mars?""
""Then we'll figure out how to make it work,"" I said. ""I'm not going to let Earth get in the way of my work.""
""I hope you're right,"" she said. ""You've worked hard on your research and it would be a shame if it all went up in smoke now.""
""We'll figure something out,"" I replied. ""I promise.""
We continued on down the street toward town center and then turned right toward the main building where the president's office was located. There were no cars anywhere in sight and people walked everywhere—most of them in white lab coats like mine. We walked past a bunch of them heading toward the main building, which also housed the lab where I did most of my work and where Sato also worked. It was obvious that they were heading in there because they were all wearing protective goggles and carrying their bulky protective suits with them as they walked. I glanced over at Sato and saw that she was smiling and looking at me like she was proud of me or something. She probably thought that it would be a good thing for me to meet the president and have him see what I was working on, but she didn't know what he really wanted from me—and neither did I.
We finally arrived at the main building and walked into the lobby where we were greeted by a large security guard who looked like he could crush us like bugs with one hand if he wanted to—or at least give us a good scare. He wore a full-body suit of armor and a helmet that covered his face so we couldn't see his expression at all, but he watched us carefully as we walked into the main building and toward an elevator.
""You two are not allowed here,"" said a voice from above us as we got onto the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor. It was Dr. Sato's voice and it had an angry tone to it.
""Who are you?"" asked the security guard, still standing behind us.
""We're with Dr. Sato,"" I replied, feeling like I should have known who she was but not being able to remember her name right away. It was like she had been in my head and was reading my thoughts or something.
""Dr. Sato is not allowed in here,"" said Dr. Sato's voice again, sounding even more angry than before.
""Are you sure?"" asked the security guard, sounding even more suspicious now that he could hear her talking to us instead of just watching us from behind his helmet. ""Dr. Sato is one of our most promising researchers.""
""I'm aware of that,"" said Dr. Sato's voice from above us, sounding even angrier than before now that she was speaking to us directly instead of just inside my own head—which was where she had been before we got onto the elevator. ""I'm also aware that she is not allowed in here without your permission, so do not tell me she is one of our most promising researchers again.""
The elevator stopped on the third floor and we stepped off into a hallway lined with doors where Dr. Sato's voice continued to grow more and more angry with each passing second as we walked toward one of them at random instead of going back out into the lobby and getting back on another elevator to go back down to ground level again. The security guard tried to stop us but Dr. Sato continued to talk over him, even though we could hear her voice coming from inside her helmet now instead of inside my head like it had been before we got onto the elevator.
""I'm sorry,"" said the security guard as soon as we opened Dr. Sato's door and stepped inside her lab, ""but Dr. Sato is not allowed in here without my permission either.""
""You can't stop me from entering my own lab,"" said Dr. Sato's voice from behind her mask now instead of inside my head where it had been before, sounding even angrier than before now that we were actually hearing her speak directly to us instead of just hearing her thoughts in our heads—which was how she had been able to get into my head before this since she was wearing her own helmet while talking to me through it from behind me. ""It's my lab!""
""Then get out of it!"" yelled the security guard as he grabbed her suit with one hand and tried to pull her out of her lab while keeping his other hand on his gun so he could shoot us if we tried anything funny—or so he thought anyway since no one ever does anything funny when they find themselves being held up by a giant security guard who is pointing a gun at them unless they're really desperate for their own lives or something even more serious than that is going wrong and they're willing to do anything to gain their freedom again—which is exactly what happened next as Dr. Sato's helmet suddenly opened up like an umbrella and sprayed out a stream of liquid that shot toward his face just as he pulled her out of her suit by her arm and threw her through one of the lab doors as hard as he could—which knocked her unconscious before she could even turn around or scream out in pain or anger or anything like that since she had just been sprayed with a stream of liquid from a giant umbrella-shaped helmet while being held up by a security guard who was holding his gun toward her head—which means that she must have been really angry at him or something—but no one on Mars would ever admit that they were angry at another person unless they were really desperate for their own lives or something even more serious than that—which is exactly what happened next as Dr. Sato grabbed his gun with both hands and pointed it at him—which is exactly what happened next as I ran over to them both and punched him in his face as hard as I could—which knocked him unconscious before he could even react—which meant that Dr. Sato must have really been angry at him or something—which meant that Dr.",1405,-0.7109790338781385,-0.07864349711658,0.332092650865793,0.4644155811021501,-1.2579745348109421
21,R_1JXSS2dDAZd8dDF,ACE_HOR_5,Horror,Ace of Spade,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't human but it definitely had two eyes and a nose like mine. The only difference between us was that this one's hair was jet black while mine was brown. This face smiled as if she knew what I was thinking about. I turned around quickly before anything else could happen. I didn't want my mother waking up. She'd think I went insane and probably lock me in another room or something.
After breakfast, I took a shower and put on some clothes. Afterward, I sat down in front of the television for a while until my mom came home. As soon as she opened the door, I said hi and then asked her if she wanted to go get some ice cream. My mom nodded and we left our house together. We walked to the nearest ice cream place and ordered our favorite flavors. They were both chocolate with vanilla swirls.
When we finished eating, I told my mom that I wanted to take a walk around the park near the lake. It was close enough to the water so you could see fish swimming below. There weren't any ducks or swans there but there were plenty of other animals. I always loved seeing all the different birds fly overhead. There would be geese, seagulls, and even pigeons. All kinds of people also used to gather here too. Some were joggers who ran by every morning. Others were just walking their dogs along the path. A few times, I saw kids playing baseball nearby. And then there was the old lady who sat alone on a bench.
As we walked toward the park, I pointed out a big rock in the middle of the pond where you can sit and watch the water. My mom liked it because you don't have to worry about anyone bothering you. Once we arrived, I grabbed the blanket off the ground and spread it out across the grass. Then we lay down next to each other and watched the sun set behind the trees.
""It looks beautiful tonight,"" my mom said as we gazed up at the sky. ""Thank you for bringing me here.""
I gave her a small smile and replied, ""You're welcome.""
We stayed there for an hour watching the clouds float past us. When darkness fell, I turned to look at the moon. It hung low in the sky right above the trees. My mom noticed me staring at it and asked, ""What are you doing?""
""Nothing,"" I lied. ""Just trying to figure out why the moon is blue.""
My mother chuckled and replied, ""That's impossible. If it were really blue, everyone would know.""
""Then how do they explain the fact that the stars are blue too?"" I countered. ""If the moon is blue, why aren't the stars? You know...the ones in the night sky?""
She shrugged and said, ""Maybe someone figured out how to make them appear that way. Maybe they're fake.""
The thought seemed ridiculous to me since no one knows how stars actually work. But then again, who am I to say whether or not someone made them? I mean, I'm only twelve years old and I still haven't figured out how to use my own brain properly yet. So maybe I should give myself more credit than I normally do.
Before I could continue talking to my mom about the stars, we heard footsteps coming closer. My heart raced inside my chest and I tried to calm down. It sounded like two people were approaching. Before long, I saw two figures standing on the opposite side of the grassy field. One was a man wearing dark clothing while the other was a woman dressed in white. Both wore sunglasses despite being indoors.
They stood silently and stared at us for a moment before turning away. My mom glanced over at me and asked, ""Who were those people?""
I shook my head and replied, ""I've never seen either one of them before.""
The stranger started heading toward the entrance to the park and his companion followed him closely. I looked at my mom and whispered, ""Did you see that?""
She nodded and added, ""Yeah. That was weird.""
Once the strangers disappeared, my mother picked up the blanket and placed it in my hands. Then we headed back home without saying anything else. Once we reached the house, we entered through the front door and closed it behind us. The lights were already on inside the living room so we decided to take our time getting ready for bed. I changed into pajamas and brushed my teeth while my mother read a book in the kitchen. I watched TV until my mom joined me in the living room and turned it off.
""Goodnight, sweetie,"" she said as she leaned against the sofa.
""Night,"" I answered.
A couple hours later, I woke up to the sound of knocking. At first, I thought I must have fallen asleep but when I listened carefully, I realized that I hadn't. Someone was knocking on the glass of our mirror. I got out of bed and walked over to it. When I peered inside, I saw a face looking back at me. It was the same one from earlier.
""Hello,"" she said.
I didn't answer. Instead, I stepped backwards and shut the glass door. My mom stirred in bed but didn't wake up. I turned around and crawled back under the covers. Soon afterward, my mom did wake up. She came downstairs and found me sitting at the table drinking a glass of orange juice. She asked if everything was okay.
""Yes,"" I replied. ""Why?""
""Well,"" my mom began. ""There's someone knocking on the glass door.""
""Oh,"" I said as I swallowed hard. ""I guess that means it's morning then.""
My mom nodded and asked, ""Do you want to go outside or stay in your bedroom?""
""Stay in my bedroom,"" I answered.
""Okay, sweetheart,"" she said. ""Are you sure you're okay?""
""I'm fine,"" I responded.
After my mom went to the bathroom, I waited for her to leave before opening the door and stepping outside. As soon as I opened the door, the sun came shining down on my face. I squinted my eyes and looked up. There were clouds floating by but otherwise, I couldn't see much. I took a deep breath and felt the cool breeze blow across my skin. My mom came outside shortly after that.
""Hey, sleepyhead,"" she said. ""How'd you sleep?""
""Fine,"" I replied.
She smiled and said, ""Let's go to the park today. We'll go to the beach first and then we can eat lunch there.""
I nodded and followed her to the car.",1167,-0.6432702263890427,-0.8685314092052955,0.4286623074635716,-0.13688898905233857,-1.6047700299448373
22,R_2ffe81VfdCfekaZ,FAN_HR_6,Historical Romance,Fandango,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He could remember watching from behind as she ate the pie and drank the ale that had been on the table when he took it to her. The smell of her filled his nose, her scent reminding him that he needed to take a bath or something because the women around here were starting to talk about him. But then he saw her gaze lock onto someone across the room, her eyes darkening, turning to a deep brown hue that looked almost black against her skin. His eyes narrowed in irritation, and he wondered why she hadn't glanced at him as he waited for her to finish eating. Then she turned back and left before he could even say anything.
He didn't really care about the conversation going on behind him; he wanted to be alone with his thoughts so he could deal with the anger inside him. Anger he felt wasn't entirely his own. It came from a man who was supposed to be the king. The Kingmaker. The man everyone thought would be king, if it weren't for the bastard he fathered by another woman.
That bastard had been dead for years, but people still talked about him. And now that it was his brother who had taken the throne, everyone knew what kind of king he would be. A tyrant, no doubt, they said.
And that made the prince angry too. He wasn't a tyrant. He was a good, fair man—or so he told himself every day. But there was the problem of how to keep the people in line while he tried to govern them. If only there was someone else to help him out . . . someone who could speak the truth and get through to people in a way he couldn't. Someone who could also stand up for him whenever the situation demanded it.
Someone like the girl he'd seen earlier that day.
He sighed and went back to serving the patrons of the tavern. She was just another servant in town and he knew he was being ridiculous. Still, he couldn't help but find himself staring out the window every time she appeared. He found himself counting her steps and imagining what her hair looked like up close. He had to fight the urge to go after her when she left, and instead he just stood there with his eyes fixed on the door until she disappeared around a corner. He knew if he did follow, he wouldn't stop until he was in bed with her.
But he'd sworn he would never lie with a woman again. Besides, she was a servant anyway.
When he was younger, before he'd left for school, it had been different, for sure. His father had allowed it then, and all the other lords in the land did too. But not anymore. The Kingmaker's line was to have only the purest blood possible. Anyone who had a bastard child or a whore in their past was to be shunned, regardless of what position they held.
So the prince had vowed to be different. That he would live up to the expectations of all the men in the kingdom and show that he was worthy of rule by making a good life for himself without the help of a woman.
It was hard to resist temptation sometimes, especially when it looked as tempting as she did. He tried to tell himself he didn't care about her, but he knew that wasn't true. And now he was wondering what would happen if he did manage to get her into his bed. Would that make him more of an equal among the others? Or would it be like his brothers and father before him—another mark against him, making him seem weak and unfit to be king.
It was probably best if he left well enough alone. He had to put this feeling behind him so that he would never fall prey to the same temptation again. For now, he decided, he'd pretend he didn't know she was in town.
When he was a few years older, if he was still alive—which was still a long shot given the odds he was up against—he would make his move and be done with it.
He watched the door intently when he served the customers. He waited for a moment after the girl left, then slipped outside and hurried down the street after her. He was glad he was dressed up for dinner tonight and wearing his best clothes. At least that part of his plan would work.
His footfalls were quiet, but he was still able to catch up with the woman. ""Good evening,"" he said when he caught up to her.
She smiled at him, and he immediately felt like an idiot. How could anyone smile at him? She was beautiful beyond compare. ""You can call me Sela.""
He swallowed hard. Had he heard her correctly? ""Yes?""
""My name is Sela.""
""Sela."" He cleared his throat. What was he going to do? Just walk away and pretend he hadn't seen her? Maybe he should just head back inside and forget about her altogether.
She looked at the tavern. ""Your name, sir?""
""I'm sorry? What did you say?"" He'd missed her question completely.
She raised her eyebrows. ""I asked you your name, my lord. You can't just ignore me.""
He shook his head. ""No. I don't know what I was thinking, but yes, my name is Marcus.""
Her smile widened. ""Marcus,"" she repeated. ""I like that. It suits you.""
""Thank you."" He had a lot on his mind, and he wasn't sure he was capable of talking to her. So far, she'd seemed nice enough, but he wasn't sure if he would ever be able to see her as anything more than the servant from the tavern.
""Well, Marcus, it seems we're both headed in the same direction.""
He stared at her. Was she suggesting they stay together? It seemed like it, but then again, maybe that was just wishful thinking on his part.
""You're heading home?"" she asked.
""Yes.""
She nodded. ""Me too.""
He was surprised when she walked with him instead of walking away from him like she normally would have. He kept his arms crossed over his chest as he continued to watch her, waiting for her to turn into the alleyways and disappear. When he saw her continue to lead the way, he was certain it must be some sort of trap.
She turned a corner right after she answered him, and he found himself staring into a courtyard. A large building was situated beside it.
""Here we are,"" she announced. ""This is where I live.""
Home? He was amazed. ""How old are you, if you don't mind my asking?""
She smiled, pleased by the fact that he cared about her age. He wondered if she had a boyfriend and hoped she did.
""I'm sixteen.""
He grinned. ""I guess we're almost the same age.""
She looked down at his hands and then back up into his face. ""Are you single?""",1218,1.5070043470174286,1.3018785616662725,1.0951139880142042,1.574800306223739,1.7192059988347448
23,R_1psTByQAA83RJ5M,GEN_HOR_4,Horror,Genesis,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The face had no eyes or nose, just two large holes for its mouth and ears. It smiled at me. I screamed in fright as it vanished. I ran over to my parents' room and knocked on their door before running back here. I sat down on the edge of my bed with my knees pulled close to my chest. My heart was racing so fast that I felt like it would explode any second now.
I could only imagine what this thing wanted from me. How did it even get into our house? And why is it still here when my parents are awake? What am I going to do if they wake up and see it too? Maybe I should call the police or something. That's an option right? I picked up my phone off my nightstand and tried to dial nine-one-one but I couldn't seem to get my finger to move. I tried calling it three more times but each time the same thing happened. I looked at the screen of my phone, hoping to find something that would give me some answers but all I saw were numbers and letters.
""What's wrong?"" Sarah asked as she opened her bedroom door. ""Are you okay?""
""Yes,"" I replied, trying to sound calm. ""Just had a bad dream.""
""Me too,"" she said, walking over to my bed. She leaned against the headboard and placed her hand on my leg. ""It was pretty scary. But I'm glad you're feeling better. You know, that thing gave me the creeps.""
""Yeah,"" I replied.
She looked down at my phone and then back at me.
""Didn't you say your phone wasn't working?""
""It isn't,"" I lied.
""Maybe we can call someone else instead?""
I turned away from her and grabbed the phone. I looked at the screen again and realized my fingers weren't moving anymore either. I tried to shake them but nothing was happening. Then I remembered where I was, and how I'd gotten here. I looked around my room to make sure everything was okay. When I saw the bed not made up and the covers thrown across the floor, my stomach dropped.
""Sarah,"" I called out.
She didn't respond so I stood up and walked towards her. There was no response. I reached out and touched her shoulder. It felt cold. I quickly let go of her and backed away. Her eyes were open and staring at mine. I felt myself start to panic as I looked down at her. Something wasn't right.
""Sarah!"" I cried out again.
Her eyes rolled back into her head and she fell backwards onto the floor. I rushed over and saw her lying unconscious. I looked around frantically for anything that might help. I spotted a book on her desk. I took it and brought it over to her. I flipped through the pages and found what I needed.
""911,"" I whispered to myself.
I pressed the buttons on the side of the phone and held it up to my ear. When I heard a voice I started to scream. I hung up the phone and threw it against the wall. Tears began to fill my eyes. I turned around to look at Sarah. She was still unconscious.
The monster was gone but now I had another problem. What should I do with Sarah? Should I try to take her somewhere safe or leave her alone until morning? If I left her here, who knew what would happen to her. I didn't want to think about it. I decided to check her pulse to be sure she was alive. I lifted up her wrist and felt it, checking for a heartbeat. As soon as I touched her arm, Sarah opened her eyes. I gasped as I stood back up.
""Where did you come from?"" I asked.
""I don't know,"" she answered. ""But I promise you I won't hurt you. I came inside because I was afraid you might be in trouble.""
""You were?""
""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come in without asking.""
""No, that's not what I meant,"" I said, wiping away tears. ""How did you get in here?""
""I snuck in,"" she explained. ""I didn't want to wake you up by knocking. I thought I could find the source of the noise and fix it before anyone woke up.""
""That's really nice of you, Sarah. But I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.""
""Okay,"" she replied. ""As long as you're sure, that's good enough for me.""
After checking on Sarah, I got dressed and went downstairs. I ate breakfast while my parents watched TV. They seemed to forget about the incident last night. I finished my meal and went to my room. I decided to turn on my computer so I could finally check my email. When I logged in, I noticed a new message at the top of my inbox. I clicked on it and read it.
Subject: Re: Hello
From: ********@gmail.com
To: ************
Hi! I saw your name online and figured I'd write you. I haven't seen you since we graduated. Are you doing alright? I hope so. You seemed pretty upset after graduation. I understand if you don't remember me. I was one of the quiet ones. We never really talked much. Anyway, I'm trying to reach out to everyone from our class. I thought maybe you could help me out. Do you happen to know where I could find ************? I've been searching for him for quite a while now.
If you do happen to know where he is, please tell him I'm looking for him.
I hope to hear from you very soon.
Sincerely,
Your Friend,

PS: I'm attaching my picture so you'll know it's me. I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you last year. I had to move away shortly after graduating. If you need any information about me, feel free to ask.
""Hello?"" I said aloud, wondering who the message had come from. I scanned through the rest of the email.

24,R_3s7g4a6UB4q5TxS,MOR_HF_5,High Fantasy,Morpho,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""The village of Alpina,"" said the man. ""I am told there is a manor house here as well. If you wish to make your way there, I will guide you.""
""Thank you,"" said Rhys.
""We will take you to a place of safety,"" added the man. ""You will be safe there.""
Rhys followed him through the village and then out onto a long, straight road that ran along the shore of the lake. They arrived at a large building that had once been a manor house, but was now falling apart. The roofs had fallen in and much of the wood had rotted. The man led them into the building and left them in front of a set of heavy wooden double doors that stood partially open to the sky. Rhys heard something inside and then the door was closed behind him and locked. He was alone in the abandoned manor house.
""Is this where I am to stay?"" he whispered to himself.
He looked around. A large open room lay before him, with a stone floor and a few crumbling chairs and tables scattered about. There were long windows on one side of the room, and he could see the sun reflecting off the lake beyond. The room was empty except for him.
""I guess I'll be spending my time here,"" he said aloud, ""until someone comes to get me.""
He sat down in one of the chairs and laid his pack down at his feet. There was a fire pit in one corner, with a small heap of wood next to it. He could see a few other doors leading off in different directions, but none were open. The only sounds he could hear were those of birds calling outside and the distant sound of the river as it flowed through the valley below.
""Well,"" he said out loud, ""at least I won't be bored.""
""You have come to take my life,"" said a voice he hadn't heard in many years, ""and with that, your own as well.""
Rhys looked up but saw no one standing in front of him. He got to his feet and looked around but saw no one there either. He walked around the room but saw no one there either. He stood on one side of the room and looked down at his feet, but no one stood there either. He walked over to the other side and looked down at his feet again, but still saw no one there.
""Who are you?"" he called out. ""Where did you come from?""
There was no reply. Rhys went over to one of the doors and tried it but it wouldn't open. He stepped back and tried another but it wouldn't open either. He stepped back and tried another door, then another, and another, but none of them would open for him.
""What are you doing?"" asked the voice again. ""You cannot hide from me.""
Rhys stepped over to the fire pit and pulled some wood out of it and then walked over to another door and tried to open it but it wouldn't move for him. He walked back over to the fire pit and put some more wood on it and then walked back over to another door and tried to open it but it wouldn't move for him either.
""Why won't you let me out?"" he asked as he walked back over to the fire pit and put more wood on it again.
He walked back over to the last door he had tried and pulled it open, but still saw no one there but himself. He stepped back over to the fire pit and put more wood on it just in case someone else came along, then walked back over to the last door he had tried before this one and tried to open it again but it wouldn't move for him either.
""Who are you?"" asked Rhys again, this time more urgently as he tried each door again just in case some other person might be hiding inside them now that he had come this far into the room. When none opened for him, he dropped his hands to his sides where they hung at his sides and waited for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first.
""Why won't you let me out?"" he asked again once more as he stood there waiting for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first. ""Why can't I get out of here?""
Still no one came, though he was sure others were hiding inside all the doors now that he had come this far into their trap. Still he waited, knowing there was no escape now except death itself, except that death would not end his torment if no one else came along before he did so himself. But still no one came....
""Why won't you let me out?"" asked Rhys again as he stood there waiting for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first....
The sun was low in the sky when Rhys finally gave up on trying all the doors in the room and sat down on a fallen chair behind him to wait for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first....

Rhys woke up with a start as something slammed into his back with such force that it knocked him forward onto his knees on top of his pack and sent him crashing headlong into an unmoving wall behind him with such force that it knocked most of his teeth loose from his jaw and sent them scattering across the floor at his feet with such force that it left him momentarily stunned with pain as his head spun around from being struck with such force that it knocked out several dozen teeth from his jaw with such force that it left him momentarily stunned with pain....

25,R_2BlLpWSdPG5mkWq,FAN_HR_10,Historical Romance,Fandango,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He knew she was beautiful even before she looked up to catch his eye. Her skin was a darker brown than most people's in their part of the world; her hair a rich gold that stood out against it. His people had pale skin and brown hair. And her eyes... they were an intense blue that matched the color of her hair.
He knew at once what she was—a slave, but not just any slave. A warrior's slave. She was the daughter of the man who had captured him and trained him and then sold him as a prize.
He had only been able to stare at her, not daring to say a word. She was an enemy, even if he didn't know for sure who her father was or where she lived. His instinct would have told him to kill her on the spot so that her father wouldn't be able to use her against him. She might already be a spy sent to see if there was some way to bring down this settlement and take it for his own.
But his master told him to give her a break. She wouldn't hurt us. And he was right. It was months later that one of the children came to talk to him. The girl who wanted to learn about the land and the gods. She was smart, and brave, and kind. She was a great help around the hut.
She told him what her life had been like with her family. They were all warriors, except the little brother and sister, and they had no slaves. They had lived with other tribes as well, but never had they seen someone like her. She didn't have a warrior's build, or the tattoos of a warrior woman. She had no scars from knife fights and spear throwings.
Then she told him her story. How they had been forced to move to a new island, how she had escaped her father when he went to war again. She told him about the man who had bought her—and how he wanted to make her his own.
They had met several times since then. Each night she spent in the hut, she told him another bit of her history. He learned about the other island where he had lived and fought, and how the man who now owned him had come to find him.
Her father had been in the same situation with the man who had found him. But the man who was now his owner was a powerful warrior chief, and everyone believed he was too dangerous to go against.
They talked on the beach, or by the fire at night. Sometimes she brought something she had made and cooked herself. She was a good storyteller, and though she didn't say much about herself, he thought maybe she had lost family members. She had said something once about them being taken away.
He couldn't help himself. Every time she came to him, he was drawn closer to her. He liked his life here, and he hated the idea of being sent back to his own home, a place where his people would hate him for the way he was now. He was too afraid to ask her to stay with him, but in his heart, he knew she would never leave him.
""I'm sorry,"" she finally said. ""I shouldn't have kept you waiting.""
He nodded and tried to smile. He was glad to see her again, but he wasn't sure why she was really coming to see him. Was it because she cared? Or was it because he had a gift for her?
He had no idea. But he did know that he had to think of a gift for her. She was a slave, after all. He didn't want her to resent him, especially since he had no real choice about his life at this point. But there must be something he could do. Something that would show her that he truly cared.
""What will you have?"" she asked.
He smiled. ""Anything you like. I mean, I can't pay for you, but I can make you whatever you'd like to eat.""
She chuckled. ""Do you always cook for people just for fun?""
""I love cooking for people who appreciate it.""
""Well, let me order then. My stomach is growling like a dog in heat.""
He laughed at that, but when he went to get the food, he couldn't find anything written down. He was going through the pantry in the back, trying to think, when the door opened behind him.
He turned and stared at her face. She was crying. That wasn't like her at all.
She looked scared. ""You didn't need to cook me dinner, Dair. You don't owe me anything.""
""It's okay."" He stepped forward and touched her arm. ""Is something wrong? Did you get hurt?""
""No. It's... it's just that I thought we would be friends, that we would talk, and you would help me figure out my life. That I would be your friend, but you..."" Tears started to fall down her cheeks. ""You're so far away. Even if I wanted to go with you, I couldn't. My parents won't let me.""
""Why? Why would they make you stay with them? Don't they love you?"" He didn't understand. Maybe he should have thought about things more carefully before he took this vow. He should have considered that he might not be allowed to keep her.
She shrugged. ""I don't know.""
""But you don't believe that.""
""Of course not. I've heard them talking about killing me, or selling me to some other man."" She shook her head. ""Maybe that's why I cried. I never expected this.""
He put his arms around her and held her close. It had seemed so natural to hug her. ""They don't have to hurt you.""
""I know, but I can't get away. I'm a slave.""
He felt a stab of pain go through his body. He had promised to protect her, and he hadn't realized he had already failed.
""I'll go with you,"" he whispered.
Her eyes flashed in surprise. ""Where?""
""Back to the place you used to live. They won't be expecting me to go, so maybe I can get there before they know I'm gone.""
She pulled back from him. She stared into his eyes, and he could see the fear in hers. ""Are you crazy? You'd walk into a trap for me? I can't let you do that. Not even for me.""
His heart ached and then grew hot with anger. ""Don't tell me what I can or can't do. I am going to get you away from there, even if I have to kill everyone there myself.",1165,-1.0355037845041255,0.932654249856058,1.1852144218179521,0.18488372074594425,-1.67546243246834
26,R_Ui5JxPk24qEWISZ,BAS_HOR_4,Horror,Basic Coherence,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my own reflection; it had black eyes and red lips like something out of an old horror movie. The figure reached through the mirror and grabbed me by the neck. My body went limp as its cold hands squeezed tightly around my throat. A sharp pain shot through my chest as I gasped for air.
""You're mine now,"" said the figure in my reflection. ""You belong to me.""
The figure pulled me closer and began kissing my neck. Its tongue licked across my skin before sinking inside of me. I felt myself getting wetter with every passing second.
I opened my mouth wide so that it could have more access to my throat. As soon as I did, the figure's head pushed down and entered my mouth. It was warm and moist, but not too much. Just enough to make me feel good.
It started thrusting its hips against mine. Each time it did, it made my body shake and shiver. It kept going even after I came. Then suddenly, it stopped.
""What are you doing?"" I asked. ""Why aren't you making me cum anymore? You promised!""
""Oh no, sweetheart,"" the figure said. ""That's not what this is about.""
The figure stood up and turned around. It then took off all of its clothes except for one item—a mask. It put on the mask and picked me up by the waist. It carried me over to the bed and laid me down. The figure climbed onto the bed and straddled my stomach. It lowered itself down until it was sitting between my legs.
""Now, we can do whatever we want together,"" said the figure. ""We'll be partners forever.""
As it spoke, the figure placed its hand on top of my thigh. It slowly moved upwards until it reached my pussy. The figure spread my lips apart and began rubbing its fingers against my clit.
""This is how I'm gonna take care of you,"" said the figure. ""Every night. Every day. Forever.""
I moaned loudly as the figure continued playing with my pussy. It rubbed my clit and inserted two of its fingers inside of me. I closed my eyes tight as the pleasure grew stronger and stronger. My breathing became heavier and heavier until I couldn't breathe at all.
""Please... don't stop..."" I whispered.
The figure didn't listen. Instead, it shoved its fingers deeper inside of me. I screamed out in pain as my body tensed up. Then the figure removed its fingers from my pussy. It replaced them with its cock. It positioned the tip right above my pussy and pushed forward. I let out another scream as the figure penetrated me.
""Ahhh! Nooo! Please... please don't hurt me!""
The figure ignored my pleas and began fucking me hard. I cried out louder than ever before. My cries echoed throughout the room until they were drowned out by the sound of the bed crashing against the wall.
The figure fucked me harder and faster until I finally climaxed. I screamed out loud as waves of pleasure coursed through my entire body. The figure kept pounding away at me until it came too. It collapsed on top of me, panting heavily.
""That was amazing,"" said the figure. ""Let's do it again sometime.""
The figure lifted itself off of me and sat next to the bed. I lay there motionless, unable to move or speak. After a few moments, the figure leaned over and kissed me on the forehead.
""Goodnight, sweetheart,"" it said. ""Sweet dreams.""
Then it left the room. I waited for the door to close before I rolled over and tried to get some sleep. But I couldn't fall asleep. All I could think about was that figure. What had happened to me? Why was I being taken advantage of like this?
I thought about calling the police, but I knew that wouldn't help. They'd just tell me that I must have been dreaming. There was nothing I could do. So instead, I decided to try and forget about it. I would pretend that none of it had ever happened.
But that was easier said than done. I couldn't stop thinking about that figure. I wondered if it was real. If it was, where was it now? Did it go home and fuck its wife and kids while I was still lying here in bed?
I tossed and turned all night long. Eventually, I fell into a deep sleep. When I awoke, the figure was standing over me once again. It stared down at me with those red lips and black eyes.
""Hello, sweetheart,"" said the figure. ""How are you feeling today?""
""I'm okay,"" I replied.
""Are you sure you're alright?"" asked the figure. ""Do you need anything? Would you like to talk about last night?""
""No,"" I said. ""I'm fine.""
The figure smiled and nodded. Then it stepped closer and kissed me on the cheek.
""Thank you for letting me stay with you,"" said the figure. ""I promise I won't cause any trouble.""
""Okay,"" I replied. ""I'm glad you're staying with me.""
The figure smiled and gave me a hug. I wrapped my arms around it and held it tight. I felt safe in its embrace.
""Don't worry,"" said the figure. ""I'll always be there for you. I'll never leave your side.""
I hugged the figure tighter and buried my face into its chest. I didn't know why, but I felt safer when it was hugging me like that.
""I love you,"" I whispered. ""Please don't ever leave me alone.""
""I won't,"" said the figure. ""Never again.""
The figure left the room and closed the door behind it. I got out of bed and went downstairs. I fixed myself some breakfast and ate it in the living room. Then I cleaned up the dishes and went upstairs to take a shower. I washed my hair and brushed my teeth. Then I put on a fresh set of clothes.
When I finished dressing, I went outside and sat down on the porch. I watched the sun rise over the horizon. It was beautiful. The sky was filled with bright colors and fluffy clouds. Birds chirped and fluttered their wings as they flew overhead.
I sat there for hours, watching the sunrise. I felt calm and peaceful. I was happy. I was finally free of that horrible figure.",1109,-0.7513607043216733,-0.7287632762300318,0.8348018541353789,0.23949800919857892,-1.6090642724929456
27,R_1n8XzaYGDtk0ghT,ALL_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
As I walked down the sidewalk toward the center of town, I pulled up the message on my wrist computer and started to read it. It was a short message, but it gave me pause. The president was requesting our presence? This had never happened before. He usually just sent a note.
When I arrived at the building where I'd been living for the past two years, I walked into the lobby and waited as a young woman in a white lab coat handed me a visitor badge. I checked in at the front desk, and then went down a long hallway lined with offices until I came to one marked ""President's Office."" I stepped inside, and there sat President Kuklo, waiting for me.
""You're early,"" he said with a smile as I stepped inside his office. ""We were hoping you would come."" He gestured for me to sit in the chair across from him, so I did.
""Thank you for inviting us to your office today,"" I said as I took off my helmet and placed it on the floor next to me. The room was cool, but not uncomfortably cold like some of the buildings back on Earth. The air recyclers were efficient here, and the atmosphere was breathable.
The president nodded and smiled again. ""Thank you for coming, Doctor,"" he replied. ""I know you have a busy schedule, so I'll keep this brief. As I'm sure you've heard, we are having trouble with the colony's food supply. We haven't had any luck growing crops, and the soil is too thin to grow much of anything. Our food supplies are running out, and I need to get our agricultural team working on finding a solution.""
I was shocked by this news. The president hadn't mentioned that he was having any issues with the food supply. If he did, I must have missed it. ""What's your current ration status?"" I asked, trying to sound calm.
""Our rations last about three months, and we've used up half of them already,"" he answered. ""That means that if things don't improve soon, we won't be able to provide for our people for much longer. This is why I wanted to talk to you. I need you to help us find a way to solve this problem.""
My mind started racing. ""I'm afraid I don't have the experience you need for this,"" I told him honestly. ""I'm not trained in agriculture. You should ask Dr. Sato to come down here to Mars.""
""I know she's a scientist,"" President Kuklo said. ""But her job is to research how life originated on Earth, not to find a solution to a problem like this. And she's already working on something else at the moment. That's why I thought you might be a better person for the task.""
""You think I can do this?"" I asked him.
""Yes,"" he said with a nod. ""I have complete confidence in you.""
""Well,"" I said with a smile. ""That makes me feel better."" I paused for a few seconds before continuing. ""But let me tell you what I would need if I were going to help you out with this problem.""
""Go ahead,"" he said as he leaned back in his chair.
""First off, you need to send someone down to Earth to get some help,"" I said. ""They need to bring back soil samples from different locations around the planet. Then they need to mix it together in the labs so we can see if any of it has the ability to grow.""
""And how long will that take?"" he asked.
""It depends,"" I told him. ""The soil sample will only tell you part of the story. We need to do tests to see what kind of plant it might grow into."" I paused and took a deep breath before continuing. ""You're going to need at least one year, maybe two or three, to figure this out.""
""Do you have any other suggestions?"" he asked, leaning forward again.
""Well, another thing you could do is get more people involved,"" I told him. ""Maybe some of your political rivals who aren't currently on the council. If you had enough people working on it, it might make progress faster.""
""You think that's a good idea?"" he asked.
""Sure, why not? It'll get them out of their offices and doing something useful for once,"" I said with a laugh.
""I like it,"" President Kuklo said with a smile. ""We can send a message to the other members of the council and ask them if they'd be interested in helping out. Once they hear about the food supply problem, they'll probably want to get involved.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""But you also need to let them know that it will take a lot longer than one or two months to find a solution.""
""I agree with you on that,"" he said. ""And we'll need to make sure they understand that we can't just start growing crops out here on Mars. The plants need sunlight, which we don't have much of here on the planet.""
""I'll talk to Dr. Sato,"" I said. ""She's already working on some things with plants that can grow without the sun.""
""Good,"" President Kuklo said with a nod. ""Let me know when you've talked to her, and I'll put the word out to the others."" He stood up from his chair and looked down at me. ""Now, I'm going to go tell our agricultural team about this so they can start planning their next move. You can call me back if you have any questions.""
As the president left his office, I took a deep breath and sat back in my seat. I didn't really know what to think about the whole thing. We were going to have to work on a solution to the food shortage, but I wasn't sure how I was supposed to help with it. All I knew was that I would do whatever it took to keep our colony alive and thriving.

28,R_1ISGmrsK3H6zgrV,GEN_HOR_3,Horror,Genesis,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was in total darkness just like everywhere else in this room except for the dim red light coming from the TV. The face seemed familiar but I couldn't place what it might be.
The face stared at me with an expression that made my skin crawl. My heart started pounding hard as the image began moving closer to me. As it moved, I saw a pair of thin arms reach through the mirror. Then they grabbed my neck and pulled me toward the mirror. I tried pulling away but they were too strong.
Before long, I found myself standing before it. It was a woman with long black hair and pale white skin. She was dressed all in black with a trench coat over her shoulders. Her eyes were hidden by dark sunglasses. A large bag hung from one shoulder.
She slowly reached out toward me with her hand. Then she lifted her arm high above her head and brought it down violently to strike me across the face. I cried out and fell backward onto the floor. I felt something warm run down my cheek. Blood? It hurt like hell!
The woman stepped forward and grabbed my chin with her left hand, then turned my head so that I could see the blood dripping from her fingers. Then she opened her coat wide and showed me that there wasn't any wound there, only blood running down her arm.
""Oh, no!"" I said. ""It's a vampire.""
When I looked around, the room was completely black except for the red glow from the TV. For some reason, I wanted to get out of here but didn't know how. All I could do was watch the woman walk up to me.
She put her hands on my shoulders and pushed me against the wall. Then she drew her lips close to mine. I struggled to pull back but she forced me forward. The next thing I knew, she had bitten into my neck. I screamed and tried to push her away but she clung tighter.
Then something changed. Suddenly, the pain stopped. My throat felt good and warm.
The woman released me. She let go of my neck and backed away. Then she took off her sunglasses and held them up in front of her face. They were gone!
The vampire laughed. ""What are you going to do now?"" she asked. ""You can't fight me. You're dead.""
I stood up and ran down the hall to find the light switch. I flipped it on and saw the red light again. But when I went back to the bedroom door, the vampire wasn't there anymore. I looked around the room for a moment, then decided to leave. I opened the closet door and stepped inside.
As soon as I closed it, the lights came on. I was startled. The light was bright and uncomfortable but that was nothing compared to the feeling I got when I saw the door open behind me.
I was about to turn around when the vampire appeared again. She walked right past me and sat on my bed.
""Why did you wake me up?"" she asked.
""I don't want to stay in this hotel,"" I told her.
""Why not? What's wrong?""
""Because of vampires.""
""Vampires? Don't make up stories. There aren't any such things as vampires.""
""Really?"" I asked. ""How do you explain what happened to me just now?""
""Don't worry about that. Just stop worrying. Everything will be fine.""
""Yeah, I'm sure everything is fine.""
""So, why are you leaving?""
""My friend has been killed. I have to go home.""
""That's terrible,"" she said.
""It is,"" I replied. ""And I need to tell his family that he died.""
""His family won't believe you. No one ever does.""
""Have you seen him? Do you know where he is?""
The vampire shook her head. ""No. He hasn't returned home yet.""
""But if he doesn't come back soon, the police are going to ask me where he is.""
""They'll probably send you to prison instead.""
""Prison?"" I said. ""What's that?""
""I guess you'd call it a jail. It's a place where bad people go.""
""Are you a bad person?""
""Of course not. I'm very nice.""
""Then why would you go to prison?""
The vampire shrugged. ""I don't know, but I've never been there before.""
""Well, I hope you enjoy it,"" I said. Then I walked out of the room and headed down the stairs. I started down the hallway and ran smack into someone.
""Watch where you're going!"" someone shouted.
I looked up and saw a man in a business suit standing in front of me. I must have hit him pretty hard because he was holding his chest.
""Are you okay?"" I asked.
He nodded and then smiled. ""Yes, I am. Thank you for asking.""
""Sorry about that. It's just that I didn't see you there.""
""It's all right, really. I'm used to getting bumped into. After all, I'm blind.""
""Blind?"" I said. ""How can you be blind?""
The man laughed. ""It's a long story but I was born without eyes. People always think I'm joking or making fun of them when I say that. But I'm not. I really am blind and have been since birth.""
""I'm sorry to hear that,"" I said. ""I wouldn't wish something like that on anyone.""
""Thank you for saying so. It means a lot to me.""
""So, what are you doing here?"" I asked.
""I'm trying to get up to my room. I work at the hotel and live upstairs. I was walking along the corridor and lost my way.""
""Do you need help?""
""No, thank you. I believe I can manage on my own.""
""Maybe I should go with you just in case something happens. You never know, right?""
""I suppose you're right.""
We walked together to the elevator. When we got there, I noticed a little boy staring up at us. His mother was standing beside him holding his hand and smiling.
""Who's that?"" the boy asked.
""A friend of mine,"" I said. ""He's blind.""
""Is he scary?""
""Not at all. He's a very nice man.""
I helped him into the elevator and pressed the button to take us to the fourth floor. Then I went back to my room and packed my suitcase.",1104,-1.5586938852976615,-1.400132631156237,0.8922951802521895,-0.28842399158173443,-1.2428262947590365
29,R_25Ryuf2Rlrdy1IF,MOR_HF_1,High Fantasy,Morpho,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""What are we doing here?"" asked Raithe.
""It's a good place to start,"" said Lanta. ""There are no towns here.""
""There's no people here either,"" added Raithe. ""I think it's a place for people to be.""
""It's a good place to start,"" repeated Lanta. ""There are no towns here.""
""You're really starting to sound like me,"" said Raithe.
""I'm starting to sound like you because you're starting to sound like me,"" she said.
Raithe smiled to himself as he looked at her. That's why he'd married her, wasn't it? She was his mirror image in so many ways. But not in this one.
""We should be careful around here,"" he said.
Lanta nodded. ""It's probably best if we don't speak unless we have to.""
Raithe glanced at her again and shook his head. ""What's gotten into you? You're acting strange.""
She smiled at him. ""I'm acting strange because I've been too long away from my friends."" She looked up at the sky and pointed toward the west. ""I'm going to go talk to the birds.""
Raithe looked over at her, confused.
""The ravens,"" she said. ""I think they can tell us more about this place.""
She turned and walked toward the lake with her bow and quiver, leaving him staring after her. He'd often heard of birds being able to speak, but it was never something he'd considered possible. But maybe it was true. In some places, people spoke to the wind and even the sun to tell them what to do. Maybe birds could do the same thing, or at least know more about the area they lived in than they did.
Raithe looked down at his own hands, feeling the calluses on them from years of working with his hammer and chisel. His hands were his livelihood, and he loved his work. Then why did he feel so unsettled? He shook his head and sighed, thinking he'd rather be anywhere but here as he walked over to where Lanta had dropped her bow and quiver. She was kneeling in front of a raven that had settled on a branch near the water's edge when he walked up beside her and knelt down next to her. He placed his hand on her shoulder and leaned close to whisper in her ear, ""You're lucky I love you.""
She smiled up at him and whispered back, ""I know.""
Raithe laughed as he turned back to look at the bird again, still trying to make sense of what he was seeing and hearing. He turned back to Lanta, but she was gone.
""Where'd you go?"" he asked, but she wasn't there anymore either. He stood up and took a few steps in the direction she'd been heading in before looking back down toward the water's edge where the raven was sitting on a small branch with a beak full of food. He wasn't sure what he'd expected, but not this. He knelt down again and picked up the food, then held it out toward the raven so that it could eat from his hand, but the bird didn't seem interested. Instead it just kept staring down at him with its black eyes before flicking its beady black eyes away again and turning its head toward the north, where Lanta had been heading.
""What do you think it's saying?"" asked Raithe as he looked down at the raven again before turning to look at the lake and the small village that sat on its shores as well as the two towers guarding it.
The bird looked back at him then flicked its eyes away again before turning its head back toward the north once more. Raithe waited for another answer but none came; only silence. He stood up again and looked toward the north as well before looking down again at the raven as it stared back at him with its black eyes before flicking them away again as it turned its head toward him once more before turning its head toward the north once more before flicking away its eyes as it turned back toward him again before turning its head toward him one more time before flicking away its eyes as it turned its head toward him once more before turning its head toward the north before flicking away its eyes one last time before turning away from him once and for all before finally turning its head toward him one last time before finally flicking away its eyes as it turned away from him completely before finally turning its head toward him one last time before finally turning away from him completely before finally turning its head away from him completely before finally flicking away his eyes completely before finally turning away...
Raithe stopped walking around the lake and stood staring at where the raven had been sitting for several minutes as he struggled to make sense of what he'd just seen and heard when finally he heard a soft voice behind him say ""I'll be right back.""
He turned around slowly and saw Lanta standing there looking at him with a smile on her face, then she held up a small stone in her hand and tossed it into the lake with an easy flick of her wrist. It hit the water with a splash that sent ripples running out across the surface, then all was quiet once more except for the sound of water lapping against rocks on shore several yards behind them as Raithe turned back toward where she'd been standing just a moment ago but there was no sign of her anywhere now except for the stone she'd thrown into the lake where it lay quietly bobbing on top of the water among ripples that spread out across the surface then faded away quickly without leaving any trace of them behind except for an occasional ripple that would appear for only a moment then vanish without leaving anything behind except for an occasional ripple that would appear for only a moment then vanish without leaving anything behind except for an occasional ripple that would appear for only a moment then vanish without leaving anything...
""That's better,"" said Lanta as she came up beside him and smiled at him, then reached up and took his hand in hers so that she could lead him back home without having to say another word or risk any more trouble from whatever might be waiting for them there.<|endoftext|>
Sighing, Raithe followed her quietly without saying another word or risking any more trouble from whatever might be waiting for them there either as they walked up around the lake until they passed between two tall mountains on either side of them and reached their home once more where they stopped beside their door and waited for someone to open it for them which Raithe did not care one bit about because it led straight into their bedroom where Raithe didn't care...<endoftext|>
Raithe slept alone that night even though he knew Lanta was there somewhere in their bed because she had no way of knowing that Raithe knew about her conversation with the raven anyway because he didn't want her to know that he knew about it anymore than she already did anyway because he didn't want to get into any more trouble than he already was in so...<endoftext|>
In the morning Lanta left their bedroom without saying another word or risking any more trouble from whatever might be waiting for them there so...<endoftext|>

30,R_2VyWUcrNwsjMtQV,LOW_HR_7,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The man's wife had been murdered and she was there to find out what the murderer looked like so that she could give her husband justice.
He'd never seen anyone so beautiful before. Tall and lithe, with long flowing blonde hair and bright blue eyes that shone like stars, she made him feel as if he was nothing more than dirt beneath her feet. He wanted to touch her skin, run his hands over her body until he felt those breasts under his palms, or better yet bury his nose in her neck and breathe deep the sweet scent of woman. It was as if someone had poured ice water down his back when he realized it wasn't a man sitting next to the pretty woman but a young woman who should have been his age. His mind was filled with a thousand images of him touching her, kissing her, loving her in ways that would make them both scream out with joy. He was a monster for even thinking such things about his own flesh and blood.
She left the tavern, telling him she needed to be alone to think. The image of her face stayed in his mind and tormented him every day. Her beauty had stolen his heart right from his chest. Every single time he closed his eyes all he could see was her.
After a time, she appeared again and came to his table. She sat down across from him and stared straight into his eyes without blinking once. ""I can't stop thinking about you,"" she said simply.
""And why is that?""
Her smile was radiant as she answered, ""Because I know what you are.""
He shook his head, confused. ""You do?""
""I'm a Hunter. My name is Talia. What's your name?""
He knew exactly how she knew what he was. ""My name is Gabriel. You must have heard of me.""
She smiled sadly, ""Yes, everyone has heard of you. You're famous around here. Everyone is terrified of you. There is no hope for us ever being together. If we were to get involved, there would be nothing good in our lives.""
He tried to hide his hurt by changing the subject. ""What makes you think that?""
""I've read many stories about Hunters and I've also heard what you did in the last battle against the evil King of Shadows.""
Gabriel nodded, ""I was only trying to save my people from slavery.""
Her voice took on an angry edge. ""But you killed hundreds of innocent men women and children because they were in the way of your fight. Is that really what you call saving them? You don't seem to care at all about what happened after the war ended.""
His voice softened as he explained, ""I know that's true but I have to keep them safe at all costs. There are too few of us to let anything happen to one of us.""
She stood up, tears in her eyes. ""Then you need to kill yourself. There are far too many bad memories for me now that I know what you are.""
Before Gabriel could say another word, she vanished. He went to find her later that night, determined that he wouldn't leave her side unless she was dead. He found her walking down the street towards a large building. He ran to catch up with her as quickly as he could, not wanting her to leave his sight again.
Once inside the building, she walked through the darkness to a small room that housed an enormous bed with dark red sheets. A beautiful woman lay on top of the covers, her head pillowed in Gabriel's lap while his fingers ran through her silken hair. Her eyes fluttered open slowly but didn't focus as they rested on him.
Talia watched silently as Gabriel gently lifted the woman's arm off the bed and put it around his shoulders. As soon as he touched her, she pulled away from him. ""Don't touch me!"" Her voice was cold as ice.
Talia turned around and began to walk away.
Gabriel called out to her in a gentle voice, ""Talia please wait, I want to speak to you.""
Her eyes snapped open and her anger grew. ""What do you want?""
He reached out and grabbed her hand, holding it tightly so that she couldn't pull away. ""You can't just leave, I won't allow it.""
She jerked her hand from his and screamed, ""I hate you! I despise you for being the monster everyone thinks you are and you still expect me to stay with you forever? No way! Never again will I be near you.""
Talia turned and stormed out the door leaving him behind. He sat in the chair, stunned. He didn't even try to stop her as she hurried away from him. It wasn't long before he lost sight of her completely.
It's been months since then. Gabriel has searched for any trace of her but has yet to find her. When he thought he saw her earlier tonight he ran after her only to learn she was nowhere to be found. He knows this is all part of his destiny; the Hunter and the woman he loves will never meet. But he still has hope that one day he will find her again.
He sighed and shook his head, wishing the night would end quickly so that he could go home and get some rest. Gabriel walked to the door of the tavern and paused, suddenly remembering what had brought him here in the first place.
""What's wrong?"" The innkeeper asked in alarm.
""Nothing,"" Gabriel replied, looking around to see if anyone else was paying attention to him. He opened the door and stepped outside. He looked both ways down the empty street then slipped into the shadows between two buildings.
His footsteps crunched against the loose gravel as he hurried towards the river. He crossed the bridge carefully and kept going, his heart pounding in his ears. He moved as quietly as he could, not wanting to scare away the animals that lived there. Once on the other side, he followed the path that led to the old ruins.
As he approached the entrance to the ancient cave, Gabriel heard voices coming from the shadows. He listened closely and recognized the sound of a man and a woman arguing.
""You need to tell me where she is,"" the man demanded angrily.
""I don't know,"" a soft voice whispered in response.
""How can you not know? Have you gone blind? Or maybe your brains have turned to mush?""
The woman was afraid of the angry man and was desperately trying to avoid confrontation. ""Please, let's talk about this somewhere else. I'm begging you.""
""We need to settle things right now,"" the man continued. ""I want you to tell me where she is.""
""No!"" she yelled, throwing herself down onto the ground. ""I can't betray my friends.""
Gabriel crept closer, his eyes focused on the couple. They seemed to be arguing about something very important and the woman sounded like she was hiding something big from him.
""Your friend isn't really your friend anymore,"" he growled.
""Stop saying that!"" the woman cried, struggling to stand up against him. ""Why do you keep insisting on hurting her?",1255,-1.2218383903801626,-0.39018785964534464,1.4024547656441746,0.4768083391008422,-0.6597729468207386
31,R_pt6OuIrj9mIPxQJ,GEN_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,Genesis,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The days were only about twenty hours long in winter, but since the Martian year is slightly longer than Earth's, that still meant nearly twice the amount of sunlight as back home.
My first thought upon seeing the envelope was that it might be an invitation to participate in some sort of official event. At first glance, it looked like a standard letter, but when I opened it up, I saw that it contained a brief note from the president himself.
""Thank you for your assistance in developing our technology,"" he began. ""I am looking forward to meeting with you today to discuss future partnerships between our respective organizations.""
There didn't seem to be any mention of what sort of partnership he had in mind, so I quickly tore open the next envelope in line. This one contained a detailed agenda for tomorrow's meeting. President Kiroshima was going to meet with us at two o'clock to talk about furthering our collaboration, and then there would be a reception afterward. He also requested that we send along anyone who we felt should be part of the discussion.
""Well?"" said Dr. Sato after reading through the second set of papers. ""That seems pretty straightforward to me.""
""So you're coming too?""
""Of course. You'll need someone to translate, won't you? What did you think he was going to say, anyway?""
""Why don't we wait until after lunch to make that decision?"" I asked. ""We've got plenty of time.""
After eating a quick meal at the cafeteria near the research center, I made my way over to the building where President Kiroshima was holding his meetings. As soon as I stepped inside, I felt a sense of déjà vu wash over me. The president's office wasn't far off from the one I'd visited during my last visit to Japan, though it was significantly more modernized. A huge display screen hung on the wall, and even the carpet looked different. Though I couldn't read Japanese, it seemed that there were a lot more people working behind the scenes here compared to the past.
""Ah, Mr. Watase!""
A few minutes later, I found myself sitting across from President Kiroshima and Dr. Sato in front of a large window overlooking the city. My translator, a man named Shigenobu, sat beside me. Although he spoke English well enough, I wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to practice my Japanese.
""It's nice to see you again,"" said President Kiroshima. ""And thank you for taking the time to come all the way out here for this meeting.""
""No problem.""
The president took a sip of coffee before continuing. ""As I'm sure you know, I had a chance to meet with Dr. Sato last week. We talked about several potential collaborations, and I really enjoyed her presentation.""
""She mentioned that you had been impressed by our work,"" I replied.
""Yes, very much so. I can't speak for Mr. Takahashi, but I would love to continue our joint efforts.""
I was a little surprised to hear that President Kiroshima was personally interested in our research, but I certainly wasn't going to argue with him. Even if we were just talking about basic science, anything that could help us advance our understanding of the universe was worth pursuing.
""What do you think?"" asked President Kiroshima. ""Do you feel comfortable moving forward with these plans?""
""Absolutely,"" I answered. ""I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but I believe that we are making progress, and I wouldn't be surprised to see results within the next six months or so.""
""Wonderful. Now, I understand that the two of you would like to meet with the other members of your team,"" he continued. ""Is that correct?""
""That's right.""
""Very good. Then how about we hold our meeting tomorrow instead of today? That way, the rest of your team will have a chance to join us.""
""Sounds great,"" I replied. ""But I'm not sure who else should be present.""
""You don't need to worry about that. If you'll come with me, I'll introduce you to everyone.""
President Kiroshima led us out of his office and down the hallway. It only took a few moments before we arrived at a spacious conference room filled with engineers, researchers, and other assorted professionals. Since I couldn't read their expressions or hear their conversations, it was difficult to tell what they were thinking, but I could definitely sense a sense of enthusiasm in their voices. There were five men and three women in total. Each one looked to be in his or her mid-forties, and they were dressed in crisp white shirts and dark slacks. Unlike the president, most of them appeared to be Caucasian, and there was one man who looked Japanese.
""This is Professor Ichiro Nakamura,"" said President Kiroshima as he approached the middle-aged man in the corner. ""He's our chief engineer.""
Professor Nakamura nodded politely at me as he walked over to shake my hand. ""Are you the one responsible for sending us those samples?""
""Yes, sir. Thank you for taking such good care of them.""
""Not at all. This is a very exciting development for the entire research center. We've never seen anything like this before.""
""I'm glad to hear it. I hope we'll be able to continue our work together.""
""Oh, yes, of course."" Professor Nakamura took a seat at the table. ""I look forward to it.""
Next, President Kiroshima introduced me to another professor whom I assumed was the head of the center's materials department. He was a tall, thin man with glasses and an air of authority about him. When he shook my hand, he gave me a firm grip, which was a little unusual for someone so young.
""This is Dr. Yuki Hori,"" said President Kiroshima. ""She's in charge of our synthetic biology division.""
His tone was so polite that it sounded almost formal, but when he introduced me, he dropped the formality completely. In fact, he didn't even bother to use my name.
""Nice to meet you,"" I said.
""Likewise.""
I wasn't sure if he was being rude or just didn't know my name, but I didn't let it bother me. After all, I'd met plenty of people who were both oblivious to social customs and extremely intelligent. I imagined that the latter trait was a common characteristic among scientists.
""Mr. Watase, I'm afraid that I haven't gotten a chance to meet you yet,"" he said next.
""That's okay,"" I replied. ""I've only been here for a couple of months.""
""Well, please allow me to apologize on behalf of everyone here,"" he continued. ""We have quite a few people working under us, and sometimes it takes a while to get used to each other's names.""
I understood why he was apologizing now. It was true that I hadn't learned everyone's names yet, but I couldn't imagine that it would take that long. I was confident that it wouldn't be too long before I started remembering them.",1227,1.455873362840989,-0.7281953253321263,-1.0656250874830526,0.01540802502888957,1.7465867447246448
32,R_1PctaJ1TretOflk,GEN_HOR_9,Horror,Genesis,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It smiled a horrible grin. I screamed and slammed my hand down on the mirror, shattering it. The man in the mirror stared back at me as if nothing had happened.
I ran out of the room screaming for help but when I reached the living area, everyone was gone. After I sat down in the armchair, I fell asleep.
The next time I woke up, I noticed that something was very wrong with my body. My legs were much longer than normal and my hands seemed abnormally large. As I stood up, I realized that everything was abnormally large. Everything was a lot bigger. Even my head was huge and it felt like it weighed more than it should have.
When I saw myself in the mirror, I froze in shock. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The reflection of myself was terrifyingly similar to a monster from one of my favorite horror movies.
The creature in the mirror was ten feet tall and covered in black fur except for its face which resembled the mask of death. Its teeth were long and sharp like fangs. Its eyes glowed red and they were fixed on my own. The beast's skin was scaly and covered in yellow veins. Just looking at it made me feel sick.
Before I knew what I was doing, I lifted up my shirt and pulled off my bra. A large set of breasts hung free from underneath and jiggled slightly as I moved. They were so big that even with the padding, it still hurt to move them around. I reached between my legs and stroked the furry hair that covered my pussy. I gasped when I felt how hard my clit was beneath it.
As I rubbed my pussy, I felt the urge to cum and I did just that. My whole body shook uncontrollably as I climaxed. When I finished, I looked at my reflection again and saw that it wasn't moving. It just stared back at me.
Suddenly, the mirror shattered. The monster in the mirror turned to look at me before it started to run toward me. I screamed and tried to get away but it was too fast. With every step it took, the ground below began to shake. Soon, the entire house was shaking. I could hear things breaking all around me. It sounded like the whole world was crashing down on top of us. I lost sight of the monster in the mirror for a few seconds but when I looked back, he was right behind me.
He grabbed me by the neck and lifted me into the air. He held me upside-down and squeezed his hands together until I passed out.
When I awoke later, I didn't know where I was or how I'd gotten there. I was lying on a table in a strange room. There were other girls here in the same condition as me. We were all naked and tied down to the table. All of us had long hair and huge tits and our faces and bodies were covered with thick fur. Every inch of me was covered in black hair except for my face, mouth, arms, and legs. My toes and fingers had become clawed and ended in sharp points.
There was a woman standing next to me who looked at all of us with disgust. She was about six foot tall and she had dark brown hair. Her breasts were small and her stomach was flat, but she was still pretty hot in a scary way.
""Well, well, well,"" she said in a voice that was low and deep. ""If it isn't my little friends.""
The woman approached me and examined my body closely. She sniffed me and then licked my ear. She was licking my ears!
""Who are you?"" I asked her.
She laughed and slapped me across the face. Then she grabbed my hair and forced my head to the side. She stuck her tongue into my ear and pulled out a long string of mucous.
""You're disgusting!"" I yelled.
""Oh, shut your trap and listen, freak,"" the woman told me angrily. ""We've been waiting a long time for you all to wake up. You see, we need you to do something special. Something important.""
""What is it?"" I asked.
""Soon, you will be ready to do whatever we say. But until then, we must teach you how to behave properly. That means no talking unless we tell you to. And no laughing. Do you understand?""
""Yes,"" I answered quietly.
""Good girl. Now, do you know why all of you have been brought here? What has happened to you?""
""No,"" I replied. ""I don't know anything.""
""That's not true. Don't lie to me, now. You know exactly what has happened to you. Your bodies have changed. In a few minutes, you'll remember what's going on. You'll start to change. You'll grow fur and claws and your voices will become deeper. I can feel it happening already. Soon, you won't even recognize yourselves anymore. Well, except for me of course. I'm special.""
""Why are you different?"" I asked.
""Because I am special. I was born like this. I used to be a normal human being, but now I'm a freak. You're lucky to be alive. Most of these girls weren't. Their bodies died during their transformation. Only a few of them survived. Some of them only had to go through the process once. Others went through it twice. Those poor girls never came back. They became monsters.
""Do you want to live or die? If you do, you'll obey me and do whatever I ask of you. It doesn't matter to me whether you live or die. I could care less. All that matters is what I think. So, choose wisely.""
""What are you going to make us do?"" I asked.
""Whatever I want. Whatever I feel like. You'll have no choice but to follow my orders. I'm in charge here, and you'll do what I say. Understand?""
""Yes,"" I answered. ""I understand. I'll do anything you say.""
""Good. Now, take off your clothes and let me examine you. You may as well get used to the idea of having sex with other girls while you still have a choice.""
I stripped off my clothes and she examined me for a second. Then she picked me up and carried me to the center of the room. She put me down on my knees and tied me to the floor with some rope.
""Now, I'm going to show you how to fuck. You're going to learn how to pleasure men with your mouth and ass. Once you've learned how to please a man, you'll be ready to fuck him. But you need to do it properly. Otherwise, you might kill him.""
""Kill him?"" I asked. ""How can I possibly do that?""
""You'll find out,"" the woman told me.",1207,-0.7100476699701863,-0.19855686764472175,1.6010628084676954,1.1521972645130285,0.08931533990558263
33,R_31tq6fyaL6XNFgE,ACE_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,Ace of Spade,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I made my way across town to the presidential palace where I would be meeting with the president himself. As I approached, I saw a small crowd forming outside of the gates, but no one was actually waiting there. Curious, I walked up and asked what they were all standing around for. One man told me that he had heard the president had arrived yesterday.
""You mean the president is here?"" I asked, surprised by the news. He nodded.
""Yes. We've been expecting you,"" he replied.
I shook his hand then turned towards the front doors when another person stepped forward and told me not to go any further. I looked back at him confused as he handed me a badge with a number printed on it. ""This will get you through security. You'll need it to enter the inner circle,"" he said, pointing to the line of people who had gathered behind me. I put my hands inside my pockets, trying to figure out why they'd give me a badge if they didn't want me to go in. When I thought about it, it made sense. The only reason anyone would ever be given a badge like that was because they were expected to show up somewhere. And since they were giving them away now, obviously someone had come to see me today.
That was enough for me. I put the badge on and went into the palace, walking past several armed guards who eyed me warily as I passed. Inside, I was greeted by two other men wearing similar badges, which meant I could proceed deeper into the compound. Once inside, I followed the signs until I came to a set of double doors that led to the president's office. I walked in, passing several more security checkpoints along the way, finally arriving at the president's office.
The room was large and well decorated, filled with paintings of historical figures, sculptures of important scientists, and various artifacts of ancient civilizations. It wasn't quite as impressive as some of the rooms in the White House or even Buckingham Palace, but it still held its own. A man in a black suit stood next to the door, looking at me expectantly as I approached. ""Good morning, Mr. Smith,"" he said as I entered the room. His voice sounded familiar, though I couldn't place it. ""I'm President Theodore Roosevelt.""
""Hello, Mr. President,"" I said, shaking his hand. ""My name is Peter Smith, and I believe you know my father.""
The president smiled warmly. ""Of course I do. I understand your family has been very supportive of our efforts here on Mars.""
""Yes sir, we certainly have. That's why I'm here today,"" I explained.
President Roosevelt nodded, motioning to the seat across from his desk. ""Please, take a seat. There's something I wanted to discuss with you.""
""What did you wish to speak with me about, Mr. President? Was it something related to the work I'm doing on Mars?"" I asked.
""Not exactly, though I think you might find it interesting. First, let me apologize for making you wait so long for my arrival,"" he began, sitting down in his chair. ""It's just that we've received a lot of attention recently, both positive and negative, and I felt it best to avoid unnecessary distractions while we're dealing with everything else going on here.""
I sat down too and nodded. ""No problem, Mr. President. I can appreciate how busy you must be right now. Is there anything I can help you with?""
The president smiled again. ""Actually, yes. I was hoping you might be able to assist us with a new initiative.""
""New initiative?"" I repeated.
""Yes. I've spoken with many of my advisors about this idea, and they all agree it would be beneficial to humanity, particularly if implemented early enough,"" he explained.
""Early enough?"" I questioned. ""For what purpose?""
""We're working hard to prepare for a future where humans may have to leave Earth entirely,"" he answered.
""Leave Earth…you mean go to another planet?"" I asked incredulously.
""Precisely,"" he confirmed. ""Right now, we don't have any plans to abandon our home world, but we're always prepared for such an eventuality. In fact, I think it would be wise to begin preparing for such a move immediately rather than waiting until we absolutely have to make the decision to evacuate. If we start moving things off-planet now, it should make things easier when it comes time to relocate.""
""Moving things off-planet…that sounds expensive,"" I remarked.
""Well, it would be. But we are talking about a much larger undertaking than simply relocating a few hundred thousand people,"" he noted.
""How big?"" I asked, curious.
""Let's just say there's no shortage of people willing to invest in the endeavor. We'd also need to build a ship capable of carrying millions of people, and there are plenty of companies and private investors who are interested in participating,"" he said.
""A ship…carrying millions?"" I asked. ""I thought the first mission to Mars only carried a couple of dozen astronauts.""
""Those were test missions. We needed to make sure the technology worked before sending humans there permanently. Our current plan calls for launching a fleet of ships, each carrying thousands of passengers and cargo,"" he explained. ""Once the ships arrive on Mars, they'll unload their supplies and equipment then send the remaining passengers to the surface. They'll be joined by additional ships as the population grows over time.""
I shook my head, thinking it all seemed incredibly risky. ""If the colony fails, everyone dies,"" I pointed out.
""Yes, I suppose you're right,"" the president agreed. ""But we believe the risks are worth taking. Not only would it give us a second chance at life, but it could also pave the way for the expansion of human civilization beyond our solar system. After all, once we've established ourselves on Mars, there's nothing stopping us from exploring the rest of the galaxy. We'll be free to travel anywhere in the universe.""
I shook my head. ""That's a lot to ask of anyone. Even if the risk is worthwhile, it seems like it would take a significant amount of money to pull it off.""
""We already have a good chunk of the funding,"" the president replied. ""In addition to the investments I mentioned earlier, several major corporations and private investors have pledged to contribute. I just need you to get the word out and encourage others to join the cause.""
""I'll do what I can,"" I assured him. ""Though I imagine the president of the United States isn't the best person to be asking for donations.""
The president chuckled. ""You're probably correct,"" he admitted. ""But I've got a feeling you'll come up with a solution to that problem soon enough.",1192,1.7495252302045738,-1.0895588929872457,0.08055177918918284,1.153091966148691,1.5926980250733314
34,R_3fZBZzrI9bpbNao,GEN_HF_5,High Fantasy,Genesis,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It's an idyllic place,"" said Rufra. ""A perfect place for us to meet."" He waved his hand at the water. ""Can't you just feel that calmness?""
""I can see why they chose this spot,"" said Laith.
Rufra had decided to show them the way himself. He was pleased they were so willing to follow him and hoped he would not regret it later. He could have used one of his men, but if he did, they might ask questions about where he'd been. If he stayed ahead of them, then no one need know what had happened since he last saw them.
He walked down to the edge of the water, looking back at his warriors as they followed. They looked eager now, faces alight with excitement. Maybe it was because of what they'd seen in the hills outside the city, maybe it was because of Rufra himself. Either way, there was little doubt that they believed they were going to win this war.
""What do you think they'll be like?"" said Jula.
Laith made a face. ""I don't know. I've never met people who live in such a place. It seems almost magical.""
""We won't judge them by their surroundings,"" said Rufra. ""They will still be people, just like us. We are all the same under our skins. What we choose to reveal is another story.""
Jula nodded her agreement. She turned away and watched the villagers, hoping she could get a glimpse of the women who lived there.
""Do you really think the king will listen to us?"" said Laith.
Rufra smiled. ""Who knows? But he has to make decisions based on facts, not just stories told by people who want something. Will you tell me the truth about what happened to the man you killed?""
Laith shrugged. ""He was going to kill me. He tried first but missed. Then he went for my friends. I'm sorry, but it wasn't your fault. You couldn't have known. And even if you had seen it coming, how would you have stopped him? I wouldn't have.""
Rufra looked at him, trying to work out if Laith was telling the truth or whether he was hiding something. In the end, he decided it didn't matter. If his plan worked, he would soon enough be dead anyway.
""There's nothing we can do about it now,"" he said. ""Let's talk about other things. Did you catch anything last night?""
""Yes, thank you,"" said Laith and pointed to the fish laid out on the ground between them.
""I thought you only caught a few?""
""No, I caught more than that. There's no point giving you them though. You're too big. Besides, I ate them all myself. I am a growing boy after all.""
""You certainly look it,"" said Rufra, but he didn't say anything else. He felt uncomfortable asking Laith about his hunting prowess, but he needed the information.
Laith went on to explain how he'd used a spear to snare birds in flight, then caught fish with his hands. He'd also found a herd of sheep and, once he was sure they were alone, he'd run among them, knocking them over and trampling them until he'd killed several.
""So, I think we should go to the river and see what we can find there,"" said Rufra, glancing up at the towers above the village. He knew they had to meet King Lebannen at some point, but he couldn't see any obvious place to stand and wait. ""If the king doesn't come down to meet us, then we can try to sneak inside the tower. That will give us time to plan how to deal with him.""
""How does sneaking in sound to you?"" said Laith.
Rufra grinned. ""Come on then, let's go.""
Laith picked up the basket of fish and put it on top of the pack he was carrying.
Rufra glanced back at his warriors, and they moved quickly to form a line. They were a strange-looking group; tall for men, broad around the shoulders, well muscled arms, but short legs. Some had long hair tied back in a ponytail while others wore their hair loose. Their clothes were varied, some brightly coloured, others plain browns and greens.
When they reached the riverbank, Rufra stopped and stared at the water.
""Why are we stopping?"" said Laith. ""I thought we were going to steal something.""
""I thought we might,"" said Rufra, ""but I've changed my mind. I need to think.""
Laith looked at him curiously. ""About what?""
Rufra turned to him. ""If I'm going to die, then I want to take the best things with me, the ones that mean the most to me. First, I want these."" He picked up the bow, strung it, and then handed it to Laith. ""Then I want to take this."" He held out the sword. ""And finally, this."" He pulled the dagger from his belt. ""For me, those are the important things.""
Laith took the bow and the sword, and carried them both on his shoulder. The dagger Rufra slipped into his own belt.
""I know it's not very wise to carry weapons when we're meeting royalty,"" said Rufra. ""But I don't intend to surrender them.""
Laith laughed. ""Maybe you should tell the king that before he kills you. Perhaps you can trick him into thinking you're an ally. You know, 'Your Majesty' and all that. You can even offer him friendship and peace, although I doubt he'll believe you.""
Rufra shook his head. ""I don't want to fool him. I want to scare him. When he sees that I have friends, and that they mean him harm, he will come down to meet us. We'll make our plans then.""
Laith opened his mouth to speak again but Rufra placed a finger to his lips.
""Now, let's go.""
Rufra led them to the edge of the water. He was tempted to jump in, but he knew he'd never reach the other bank. Instead, he stepped onto a rock and looked into the water.
""Have you ever seen anything like this?"" he asked.
Laith shrugged. ""No. Is it safe to walk on the rocks?""
""Yes,"" said Rufra, ""it is. Don't worry. Do you know which direction we should go?""",1115,-0.845515232114844,-0.41619888897150437,-1.1993188820792435,0.5732702978497796,-1.1619929114019878
35,R_3CN5VZmsHUKJjkB,MOR_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,Morpho,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
This meeting would be my final meeting with the president.
As the president's personal physician, I was in charge of his health and well-being. That meant I was in charge of his medical care, which was good, since I'd been the one to get him into this mess to begin with.
I walked down the main street, past the shops and restaurants. It was a beautiful day, and people were out and about enjoying it. The sun was shining, the temperature was warm, and I could hear music from a nearby restaurant that I recognized as a favorite of mine.
I turned onto another street and headed toward the presidential palace. People were out walking or biking along the street, and everyone was smiling. I think that's what I liked most about Mars—the people. It wasn't like Earth, with all of its problems and fighting. Everything was so calm here, everyone getting along and having fun.
I passed another restaurant and remembered that I had yet to have lunch. I could smell the food from here, and I could see people sitting outside, enjoying the fresh air and their meals. Before stopping in, I glanced at my watch to see how much time I had before I needed to meet with the president.
""Good morning, Dr. Bambakias,"" a voice said as I entered the restaurant.
I turned around to see a young man who looked familiar standing behind me. He smiled as he held out his hand to me. ""Good morning.""
""Good morning,"" I said, shaking his hand. ""You're not Dr. Sato?""
""No, she's still in her office,"" he said as he led me to a table in the back of the restaurant.
""Is she expecting me?"" I asked as we sat down.
""She said it was important."" He smiled at me as he took a menu from a nearby table and handed it to me. ""I've already ordered for you.""
""Thank you,"" I said, looking over the menu. There were so many things to choose from—I wasn't sure what to order.
He put his hand on my arm and smiled at me once again before leaving me alone at the table.
I looked around the restaurant once again before looking at my watch again. I had a little over an hour before I needed to be back at the palace for my meeting with President Tarkanov.
After taking my time looking over the menu for a bit longer, I decided what I wanted and sat back in my chair and waited for my meal to arrive. The sun was shining through the window in front of me, and the warm breeze was blowing through the open patio door across from me. It felt good to be sitting in such a beautiful place after all of the stress lately.
I looked up when I heard a loud noise coming from outside—it sounded like an explosion. The windows rattled, and dust fell from all around—it must have been an airship that had come down somewhere nearby, but there was no way of knowing where it had happened or any information about it at all.
Several people in the restaurant began looking out at the windows as well, but nobody said anything as they continued to eat their meals and enjoy their time off from work. It was all very odd. They were all so calm about it—as if they'd seen this kind of thing happen before.
I looked back at my watch when I felt someone come up behind me and put her hand on my shoulder. ""Are you okay?"" she asked as she leaned over so she could whisper in my ear. ""You look a little pale.""
""I'm fine,"" I said quietly as I stood up and turned around to face her—it was Dr. Sato, of course. ""What's going on?""
""That was an airship that crashed,"" she said calmly as she looked out toward the window where she'd seen it fall from. ""I don't know if anyone has been hurt.""
""Is there anyone injured?"" I asked as I looked out toward where she was staring at the crash site. ""Does anyone know?""
She turned back toward me and shook her head before turning toward another woman who had come up behind her—a woman who looked very much like her, except this one had short brown hair instead of long black hair with silver streaks in it like Dr. Sato did. ""The president just called me,"" she said quietly so only we could hear her now that we were standing next to each other. ""He asked that you meet with him here right away.""
""Okay,"" I said as she took my arm and began leading me toward where we knew President Tarkanov's office was located inside the palace grounds. ""How long have you two known each other?""
She smiled at me as we walked along next to each other. ""We've been colleagues for many years.""
""How long have you two known each other?""
""Our whole lives,"" she said quietly before pausing in front of a door leading inside the palace grounds that had been left open for us so we could enter without bothering anyone else inside—the president must have known they were coming, or maybe he wanted them to come into his office that way so he could speak with them more privately without having to worry about any other staff members overhearing him speak with them about this particular matter right away.
We stepped inside his office and found him sitting behind his desk waiting for us with his hands folded on top of it while he waited for us to sit down before speaking with us about what had happened just moments ago outside in front of his office window. ""Dr., Bambakias,"" he said quietly as he sat down behind his desk, ""we need to talk about what happened outside just now.""
""President Tarkanov,"" I said quietly as I took a deep breath before speaking again, ""what happened just now?""
""An airship went down right outside of here,"" he said as he looked across his desk at us while he spoke quietly so only we could hear him now that we were inside his office with him. ""It looks like it crashed into another airship that was coming in for landing.""
""That's crazy,"" I said as I shook my head in disbelief—an airship falling from the sky like it had? How can that even happen? An airship couldn't possibly fall from the sky! It's impossible! This is happening right now? In front of us right now? What is going on?
The president nodded his head in agreement with my disbelief before looking back down at his hands on top of his desk as he spoke again quietly so only we could hear him now that we were inside his office with him now. ""There is no way this is happening right now,"" he said quietly as he looked at us while he spoke softly now that we were inside his office with him now—just like he'd told us to do once we reached his office door so we could speak privately with him about what had just happened outside just minutes ago when one of his airships fell from the sky like it had been flying through space instead of in Earth's atmosphere—just like it had been flying through space instead of in Earth's atmosphere when it crashed into another airship that landed nearby minutes later…just like it had been flying through space instead of in Earth's atmosphere when one of his airships fell from the sky…just like it had been flying through space instead of in Earth's atmosphere when one of his airships fell from the sky…just like it had been flying through space instead of in Earth's atmosphere when one of his airships...just like it had been flying through space instead of in Earth's atmosphere when one of...",1384,1.4183066779630111,-1.0866597059191367,0.7760514338680976,-0.29136375628772393,0.7843218654481074
36,R_24u5MiXzAp2rrlC,LOW_HOR_5,Horror,Low Rider,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. My eyes went wide as I realized that this wasn't a reflection. The woman smiled at me as she leaned in close so I could smell her sweet scent. She had dark red hair that hung down to about her shoulders and was cut straight across. Her lips were full with red lipstick and her cheeks were rosy. There were two freckles on her nose like she'd been running through a field all day, which would make sense because her skin was tan. As she moved closer, I could see the outline of breasts beneath her white top. They were firm and looked perky as they pushed against the thin fabric of her top. She reached behind her back and pulled open the front button before unclasping it completely and letting it fall to the ground. The rest of her clothes followed soon after revealing herself entirely to me. The black bra covering her breasts only covered them enough for decency. Her panties matched her bra, both coming down just below her ass and ending in small bows. This woman was stunningly beautiful.
""Are you ready?"" she asked with a smile and a wink. ""I can show you things that no one has ever seen."" I was stunned and couldn't believe what I was hearing.
""What is going on here?!"" I yelled as my heart pounded in my chest. I felt like something was trying to escape from inside me. It wanted out! The woman laughed before walking away from the mirror. Before I could run for safety, she turned around and began to strip off her clothes. She didn't take any of them off though. Instead, she just dropped them where they fell. Soon, she stood naked except for her boots.
""You want me now don't you?"" she said as she bent over and grabbed her ankles. She spread her legs apart and raised her ass towards me. ""Do you think about touching my perfect body while you're alone? Do you touch yourself when you're thinking of my lips kissing your shaft?"" I couldn't answer her questions because I wasn't sure if she was talking to me or not. ""Well, then why don't we do this together!"" she said as she sat down on the edge of the tub and slid her hands between her legs. She rubbed her pussy before sliding two fingers inside of her and moving them in and out rhythmically. It was clear that she enjoyed pleasuring herself in front of someone else.
It made me wonder how many times this had happened already and who it had happened with. Did she have a boyfriend or husband? Was it a friend? Did she use sex toys? How long had it been since someone saw her naked? I was so consumed with curiosity that I couldn't look away. I wanted to know more about this woman and how far she would go with me. I had to try and get some answers, but what could I possibly say that would make her trust me enough to tell me everything? If only I could get out without having to hurt myself, I could always find another way. But I was still trapped in the room.
As the woman masturbated, I watched closely and listened. It took me a few seconds to realize what she was saying. She was describing every movement that she made, making it seem like I was watching her through a camera or something. I couldn't move away either because the door wouldn't open from the other side and she could walk right through the walls too. She stopped rubbing herself for a moment and spoke in a soft voice, ""I love when people watch me play with myself. I've never met anyone that I liked so much. I wish you would stay the night, but I'll understand if you need to leave early.""
This was all getting out of hand. What did I get myself into? Maybe I should end this before it gets any worse than this... But she was so damn sexy! And it was obvious she knew how to use her body in ways I couldn't begin to imagine. Plus, I'm sure she's not the only one here. How many others have she been with since I got here? How many men have watched her masturbate and cum? How many women have done the same? She must be an expert because she was giving me such a good show. If she kept up what she was doing, I would probably cum right there on the spot.
""I can't wait anymore,"" she whispered as she continued to rub her fingers inside of herself. She looked like she was about to cum so I decided to stop watching and focus on something else. It didn't take long for my curiosity to get the best of me again though. So I started watching her again, wondering how far she would let me watch her go.
She came pretty fast for someone that was being watched by another person. Her body tensed up as she screamed out her release and shuddered several times before collapsing onto the floor, her fingers still buried deep inside of herself. After a minute, she regained her composure and slowly stood up from the ground. She was covered in sweat and breathing heavily. Her whole body glistened like it had been drenched in water. She walked over to the mirror and looked at herself, checking out her naked body.
""So, are you going to keep staring at me or are you going to join me?"" she asked with a smirk. She was enjoying this too much for my liking.
""If you don't mind, I would love to join you,"" I replied as I stepped closer to the mirror and watched her reaction.
She laughed loudly and slapped her hand over her mouth before turning to me. ""I guess it was too soon to ask that,"" she said smiling. As soon as she turned back towards the mirror, she began to undress again.
""You know, I bet it would feel even better if we were touching each other,"" she said seductively as she slid off her panties and stood completely nude once more. ""But I suppose this will do for now."" She reached behind herself and unclasped her bra, leaving it hanging from her arms. She held her breasts up for me to see before dropping them back down to her sides. Once the bra hit the ground, she bent down and picked it up. She placed it under the sink, presumably to clean later. She turned back to face me and walked over to where I was standing. Then she kneeled down in front of me.
""Now what?"" she asked, leaning forward with her hands on my knees. She smelled incredible. I wondered if she always smelled this nice or if she used perfume. Or maybe something stronger!
""Um..."" I stammered. I wasn't really sure what to do now that she had knelt down so close to me. Her breasts were almost at eye level, and they looked great. Her skin was pale and smooth; her nipples were small and hard against her skin. They were perfectly round and pink, just like the rest of her. I reached out and ran my fingers along one of her nipples, feeling her soft skin with my fingertips.",1285,1.237905432396852,0.07884152839422036,1.234277790656657,0.9459561335770172,-1.2363311710896419
37,R_1OK1QOjPaSBfHBX,FAN_HSF_6,Hard Sci-Fi,Fandango,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
I had been awake since 0600 local time, when the alarm on my phone went off for the first time that day. My body woke up, and my mind stayed away. The only time I really did wake up early during the week was Sunday mornings when all I could think about was sleeping in until at least noon. That didn't happen very often, though.
But not today, which is why I got ready so quickly. Today was the day my life as an astronaut would begin in earnest.
After I walked out of the lobby, a small crowd gathered around me. I'm used to being recognized by people on the street because of my job, but today the attention seemed even more intense. A few dozen civilians, mostly men, stood there watching me while I made my way to the elevator bank.
I entered my personal access code to unlock the door that led inside the complex. I had to stop myself from smiling or laughing every time one of them noticed me.
The elevator was already set to take me directly to the ground floor. Once the doors slid open, I exited into a brightly lit hallway that ran straight ahead for a hundred meters. At the far end was the presidential suite, but before going that way, I stopped to look at something else: an old piece of Mars rover equipment with some sort of label on it.
It took me a second to recognize it, and then I did: the Mars Curiosity Rover. That vehicle had landed back in 2012, almost four years ago now. Since then, it had made countless trips across the surface of the planet, gathering soil samples and rocks, taking pictures, and doing other things that were supposed to be important or useful for future human settlement. But the rover was still there, and I couldn't help wondering what happened to it after it was decommissioned.
A few years ago, NASA started shipping all of its equipment to the Martian surface using the same cargo ships that had brought the lander with me. And yet, here this piece of Mars hardware was, abandoned in the middle of the hall like any old thing someone had thrown away. Maybe they needed another one to work in tandem with my own?
As I looked around the hallway, I noticed another plaque right behind it, this one showing a picture of a robotic arm and a hammer-like tool. Curiosity had a similar tool that it used to drill for rock samples on Mars; I remembered seeing one of those in the museum on Earth.
Maybe I could convince Dr. Rice to let me go outside with one of these tools to explore the surface of Mars? I could use the rover's cameras and sensors to create a map and survey the terrain, or maybe even do an actual test excavation just to see if there was anything interesting down below.
I could ask for it. Or maybe I should suggest it to Dr. Rice himself! I hadn't spoken to him since my arrival, and this might be my only chance to talk to him in advance of the mission. I was excited at the possibilities, and it felt strange to feel so excited about something that wasn't related to space.
But as much as I thought about it, and how many times I imagined walking around the surface of Mars with a tool like this in my hand, I was always pulled back to reality by Dr. Rice's voice on my phone.
""Mr. Davis,"" he said. ""You'll need to come in right away. I have a very special surprise waiting for you.""
""Of course,"" I replied.
It was almost as if Dr. Rice had anticipated that I would have a moment of confusion, so he asked one final question.
""What will you wear for your meeting?""
I didn't answer him right away. There was a reason for this. In the past, Dr. Rice always picked out my outfits for me, whether it was my suit for going outside or my casual clothes for the day-to-day of work.
""I'll be wearing my usual uniform,"" I finally said.
""Then that's where you need to come right now!"" he said, cutting me off.
This time, I had no idea what Dr. Rice had planned. Was this the first of many surprises? I didn't know; but even though I had no idea what was going on, it still seemed exciting. Maybe that was a sign that I shouldn't ask too many questions.
I headed down the hall and turned into the main entrance of the building, which led directly to the presidential suite.
Before entering, I paused and thought back to my interview with President Kirov. The man himself hadn't spoken to me very much on the phone. Instead, his secretary, Dr. Sato, had handled most of the conversation.
There were several women behind the desk, and I couldn't help staring at one in particular. She was Asian, with black hair and blue eyes. Her facial features also reminded me a little bit of a movie star named Jennifer Aniston. Of course, it was impossible for me to tell her age. When I first saw her, she was smiling and talking on the phone, which gave me a general sense of her appearance but nothing more.
But now, with an empty feeling in my stomach, I wanted to find out more. I didn't know why, but I knew that I had to see the president's personal assistant.
I tried to keep my cool as I reached the front desk. I couldn't help it; I was nervous. If the president was on the phone, this might have been my last chance to get a glimpse of his assistant. And even if I did see her, I wouldn't know whether or not she was the one who had called me earlier.
The woman glanced up and immediately noticed me standing there. Before she could say anything, I spoke to her.
""Hi, I'm David Davis. You're the president's personal assistant, aren't you?""
She smiled, and her cheeks flushed slightly as she nodded. ""Yes, sir. Dr. Sato is expecting you, so she sent me to help you get settled.""
""Thank you for that. Can you please tell me where I'm supposed to go?""
She pointed to the elevator bank to my left. ""The elevator is down there. Go on upstairs and head for the executive conference room. They'll be waiting for you there.""
""Thank you,"" I said. ""I won't be a minute.""
I walked over to the elevator bank. When I saw the button to press for the floor labeled 16, I pressed it immediately.
The elevator started to move, and I waited a few seconds before looking back. I couldn't believe it. I'd been talking to President Kirov's personal assistant for just a few minutes, and yet she already knew who I was. Why would the president be calling me if he hadn't told her who I was?
I tried not to dwell on it and instead followed the directions Dr. Sato had given me.",1255,1.3596213467623777,1.739921788130146,-0.6080897673334896,1.4133057489939498,1.7569843121303976
38,R_3oNpXJjD5cKfIOm,FAN_HF_7,High Fantasy,Fandango,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. No one was visible near the water's edge or atop the surrounding mountains. The village, if that is what it was, didn't look like much more than a collection of tents and wagons.
""This place looks abandoned,"" Iain said as he stared around at everything from the ground.
""Looks are deceiving,"" Kari replied. ""There will be people here. We must proceed cautiously.""
She stood and looked down at him before walking past him up the slope to where she could see over the top of the rise. He followed her with a sigh as they walked up together. ""What do you think they're doing here?"" he asked once they reached the top of the ridge.
Kari stopped and turned slowly to face him. She looked deep into his eyes as she replied, ""I think they were expecting visitors.""
Her words left Iain silent for a long moment as he considered how they fit together. The place certainly looked deserted and they hadn't been seen, yet this had not happened because they'd somehow missed someone else being there. There couldn't have been anyone waiting since they had only come across the place while traveling south. Yet, there they were. ""You're right, it looks abandoned,"" he admitted after a time. ""But then we haven't seen anyone here. Why are we seeing people ahead? How many?""
""Two,"" Kari answered. ""We haven't been spotted yet but that could change at any moment.""
He watched her turn back toward the settlement again before looking around himself. Everything felt off to him about the place. Something wasn't quite right, he couldn't pinpoint it just yet but the place bothered him on some level. ""It feels… wrong,"" he said in frustration.
""It does to me too,"" Kari agreed. ""That is why we'll be careful here. If there are people here they will know we've been seen and may already be moving to meet us. They'll probably send an envoy with an offer of peace and an invitation into their camp. We are expected here.""
He nodded slowly but still didn't like the feel of it. ""How can you tell?""
Kari smiled slightly as she replied, ""Because that's the way things always work, Iain. Always.""
The sounds of approaching horses came to them then, coming from ahead and behind. The riders didn't approach the encampment but rode directly past it, disappearing from sight into the valley beyond. Kari glanced at Iain in curiosity and found the same question on his face. They'd heard nothing from the riders, no calls or shouts to alert them to their presence. They'd simply appeared in the valley and ridden away again without a sound. She frowned then looked back out toward the valley to see if there was any movement there. There was none. Her attention quickly returned to where the riders had disappeared, though. They seemed strangely calm and collected despite riding straight toward them.
""They don't seem to be alarmed,"" Iain observed.
Kari shrugged, ""I'm not sure they should be. We could be under attack, they could be soldiers or bandits…""
Suddenly, there was a shout to their left as a rider appeared from behind the wagons at the village and galloped toward them. His mount was small and well-groomed with a black hide and the rider wore a gray cloak with a hood pulled low over his head.
Iain turned his attention to the man approaching. The black horse raced past them as the rider shouted something in a language neither recognized. They looked at each other with confusion written plainly on both their faces as he continued coming down the ridge toward them. Kari held her hand out to Iain with a questioning look and motioned for him to follow her. They hurried down the ridge to where she stood and looked down at the man. ""Who are you?"" she asked with a raised eyebrow.
He reined his horse in abruptly and looked back to where the village disappeared into the valley below them before turning and addressing Kari in a deep voice. ""I am Prince of the Realm, Erynion, Lord of the Silver River, and rightful king!"" he declared in a strong voice. ""You have crossed into my land uninvited and my guards warned me you were coming. I am here to offer you my hospitality and friendship.""
His words made Kari and Iain look at each other with surprise. The prince was a bit shorter than Iain but broader across the shoulders and arms. His gray cloak fell to mid-thigh and had a black trim along the edges to match the lining of the hood. He stood straight and proud on his horse like a warrior who knew he was in command. His horse reared suddenly when he saw Kari and started to rear up in fear, but his rider held it back tightly. As the horse struggled and tried to turn and flee, Erynion dismounted quickly, grabbed the reins, and calmed his horse with the touch of a hand. Iain watched as the man took two strides toward Kari's outstretched hand and stopped to shake it firmly.
""Well met, Lady Kari,"" he began in an almost formal tone. ""I am pleased to greet you.""
""Please, call me Karian Vanador,"" she said. ""I've been a little confused by all this. Who are you and why are you here?""
""Erynion,"" the young warrior said, nodding. ""Erynion and Karian. That was the only response you would give when I approached your party. You didn't seem surprised to see me.""
""I am surprised, sir,"" she told him. ""And confused as well. I don't know how I can help you.""
Erynion chuckled softly, ""Yes, I can tell that you are a woman of great character. Your reputation precedes you. You must forgive me for taking your silence and the fact that neither of you responded to my greeting as anything other than rude behavior. That was never my intent.""
""No offense taken, Prince of the Realm,"" Kari replied with a grin.
He laughed lightly at her joke and returned her grin. He stepped forward and looked down at Iain as he introduced him. ""I am Erynion, son of King Zalathorm and Lord of the Silver River. This is my friend and comrade in arms, Iain.""
Iain bowed slightly as he shook the young warrior's hand and said, ""Greetings, Prince of the Realm.""
As they greeted one another, Kari noticed that the prince's hands were clean and well-manicured. His fingers were long and thick with a slight curve to the last joint. They gave her a sense of strength, of authority, and of control which matched his voice and demeanour perfectly. When he'd finished greeting Iain, he turned back to Kari and bowed deeply.",1197,-0.26830606074349966,-0.19847972894854768,-1.1068907286996947,-0.1908733318227269,0.30214245584320143
39,R_3NJwJ1YI321mrzT,MOR_HOR_7,Horror,Morpho,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was my own, but the face was distorted and looked haunted.
I screamed and fell backwards into the bed, knocking the bed frame over. I could hear the headboard banging against the wall. I thought I heard a few voices, but I couldn't make out what they were saying.
I sat up and reached out to touch the mirror, but stopped when I felt something on my hand. It was a small spider, just like the ones that had been in my room before. This one was the size of a dime and I screamed again. I pulled my hand away from the mirror and the spider crawled up my arm. It seemed to be crawling up my arm and into my body because it felt like it was crawling inside me. I screamed at the top of my lungs and then fell back onto the bed, unable to move.
As I lay there on the bed, screaming and crying, I could hear a voice. It sounded like my mother's voice, but it wasn't her voice. It was a deeper voice and it scared me further. The voice said, ""Come here little girl, come here."" Before I could say anything else, the voice grabbed me and pulled me out of bed.
The next thing I knew, I was lying on the floor and someone was walking around in my house. The next thing I knew, I was lying in a ditch next to a field with a few other people, all looking down at me. They were all dressed like the woman who had woken me up in the first place. They had their hands pressed against their heads and they were screaming at me to help them.
I heard someone say that they were going to kill me next and then they would all die.
""Help them,"" I begged them. ""Please help them.""
""You're next,"" they said to me. ""They're coming for you next.""
""Help them,"" I begged them again. ""Please help them!""
Then, just as quickly as it came, the voices and everything faded away and I could move again.
I opened my eyes and saw my mother standing over me with a shotgun in her hand. She yelled at me to get up off the floor and put on some clothes. She told me to call 911 and tell them someone had broken into our house and started to kill everyone in it.
""What happened?"" I asked my mother, still not understanding what had happened or why she woke me up so early in the morning.
""Someone broke into our house,"" she said to me as she stared at me with a stunned look on her face. ""I got up to check on you and I found you on the floor with blood all over you.""
""Wh-who did this?"" I asked her, still in a daze as I tried to remember what happened last night to cause all of this.
""I don't know,"" she said as she stared at me with a terrified expression on her face. ""I don't even know what happened.""
The police came out to our house and took our statements while they searched through everything looking for clues as to what might have happened last night. The police asked us if we had seen anything out of place or if we knew who might have broken into our house last night. We didn't have any idea who would have done this or why they would do this to us. My mother was an early riser so maybe whoever did this came into our house while we were asleep and tried to kill us all, but we had no idea why they would have done such a thing or why they would have killed some of us but not all of us. We just didn't know who had done this or why they would have done such a thing. We just didn't know anything about it and we didn't know anything about how it had happened either because we were all still in shock from what had happened last night that everything felt like a dream that we were trying to wake up from, but none of us could remember what had caused us to wake up on our own in the middle of the night with blood all over us. The police left after taking our statements and giving us contact information for a detective who would be in contact with us soon. My mother called her parents and told them what had happened just in case something else happened while we were alone at home so they could come get us if needed.
The next morning they came by to pick us up while my mother stayed behind to clean up some of the blood that had splattered when we were all attacked by some unknown assailant last night. We drove back over there with them so they could help us clean up some of the blood that was still on our clothes without getting blood stains on our cars too. We went back home after that and stayed home all day long while we waited for our detective to contact us about what had happened last night so we could try to figure out if someone wanted to hurt us or if someone wanted to harm us or if someone wanted us dead or if someone wanted us alive but wanted us dead too or if someone wanted us dead just because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us alive just because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us to live or die or die or live or die or live or die or die die or die or live or die or live or die or live or die or die but not live forever but live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by living now by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so

40,R_3qWmc21gq7tmGJa,GEN_HR_9,Historical Romance,Genesis,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The sight of her had been enough to take his breath away, but it also gave him an unexpected rush of anger that made him want to hurt someone for hurting her. That same woman, who had once been so beautiful she seemed to have stepped out of the pages of a fairy tale, now looked old and worn. Her hair was thinning, and there were lines around her eyes that hadn't been there before. It didn't make sense—how could this be happening?
""I'll be right back,"" he said, pushing his chair away from the table to go see what was wrong with her. He never even got past the doorway when the innkeeper came running up behind him. ""What's going on?"" the man asked breathlessly.
""She looks sick.""
""That's because she is sick,"" the landlord said in exasperation. ""And you've done nothing but stare at her all night. She's not interested in you anymore, so leave her alone.""
He wasn't sure why, but he couldn't accept that answer. His mother had always told him how important it was to treat people with respect. Even if they weren't particularly nice or kind, it was still important to show them courtesy and kindness. So, he went back to the table and sat down again.
""May I help you?"" she asked. There was no hint of warmth left in her voice. In fact, it sounded as though she was trying to sound harsh.
""I'm sorry,"" he stammered. ""I thought you might need some help with something.""
Her eyes narrowed slightly. ""No, thank you. You should get some rest. It isn't polite to keep a stranger up all night.""
""But—""
""Go home!"" she snapped. Then she turned and walked away without looking back.
The next few hours passed in a blur until the sun finally rose, bringing with it the promise of another day. All he could remember after that was walking back toward town, carrying his heavy load of firewood under his arm. Everything else disappeared into darkness. When he woke up the following morning, he found himself lying in the middle of the forest. He was covered by leaves and branches, and he felt like someone had stolen his body while he slept.
It took him a moment to realize where he was. He'd been working for the local lord, cutting down trees to build a new castle. It was part of a larger effort to expand the area around his home. Now that he was here, however, he decided he needed to find a way to get home. If only he could remember exactly how he'd gotten here, perhaps he would know the quickest path to follow.
He trudged through the woods, searching for any sign of a trail, but he found none. Finally, he came across a stream, which he followed upstream. He was almost certain he'd crossed it before, but there was no telling whether he'd gone far enough. All he knew was that he wanted to get back to his village as quickly as possible.
He was just coming upon the place where the stream joined a larger river when he heard shouts echoing through the trees. He stopped and listened carefully. At first, he thought it might be his friends calling out to him, but then he recognized their voices. It sounded like they were arguing about something.
Then a familiar voice called out, ""What are you doing here?""
He started to run toward the sound of the voice, but it was too late—the bushes rustled, and two men dressed in black appeared in front of him. They wore long cloaks that hid everything except for their faces. One was tall and lean, and the other was shorter and stockier, but both had dark brown hair. As soon as they stepped closer, he recognized the third man. He was the innkeeper, and he was holding a small knife in one hand.
""Did you follow me?"" he demanded.
""You look suspicious, just wandering around in the forest,"" the taller man said. ""We thought we should check you out.""
""I'm not lost,"" he replied. ""I was heading for town.""
""Where's your horse?""
""I don't have a horse,"" he insisted. ""Why would I need a horse?""
The three men stared at each other silently. Suddenly, the short man pulled his knife out and stabbed it into the ground.
""Here's a better question,"" he said. ""Have you seen any horses nearby?""
The taller man shoved him aside and bent down. His fingers brushed against something, and he reached inside the hole. The smaller man grabbed him by the shoulder and jerked his head up.
""What did you do?""
""Nothing,"" he protested. ""Just touching whatever was in the ground.""
The tall man moved close to the other side of the hole and leaned over it. When he straightened up again, he was smiling. ""This isn't good,"" he muttered. ""He must have found a cave.""
""A what?"" the skinny man asked.
""It means there's treasure hidden underground,"" the tall man explained. ""I'm going to have to report this immediately.""
He started to turn away, but the smaller man seized his arm and shook his head. ""Don't bother. Nobody will believe us anyway. Besides, we're going to take it for ourselves. And who knows? Maybe there really is some treasure buried here.""
The tall man smiled and nodded. ""I can't wait to start digging,"" he said.
The short man stood back up, and the three of them headed deeper into the woods. They didn't say anything to each other while they searched, but he noticed that they kept glancing back at him several times. When they finally found what they were looking for, he realized why.
They were standing in front of a large opening in the ground. The largest man picked up a stone and threw it down into the pit. A moment later, he heard the sound of running water, and the rock shot back out of the hole.
""There's a tunnel leading down here,"" the tall man said.
""Excellent,"" the short man said. ""Now let's fill it up and cover it up. We don't want anyone else stumbling upon this.""
The taller man began scooping dirt out of the hole with his hands. It filled the pit quickly, and soon it was completely covered. By the time he finished, the sun had already started to sink below the horizon.
""That should hold for now,"" he said. ""We'd best head back to town before it gets dark.""
""All right,"" the short man agreed. ""Let's go.""
He looked over at the tall man, who was staring intently at the mouth of the tunnel. ""What are you waiting for?"" he asked.
The big man turned and grinned back at him. ""For you to say goodbye.""
Suddenly, there was a loud clanging noise. He jumped back in surprise, and the others started laughing.",1185,0.6629117475068393,-0.9307743608204999,0.24271206914299304,0.32557715713088387,1.0473210488843037
41,R_3hooLmBSkVHLcbj,ALL_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
As I walked down the sidewalk toward the center of town, I pulled up the message on my wrist computer and started to read it. It was a short message, but it gave me pause. The president was requesting our presence? This had never happened before. He usually just sent a note.
When I arrived at the building where I'd been living for the past two years, I walked into the lobby and waited as a young woman in a white lab coat handed me a visitor badge. I checked in at the front desk, and then went down a long hallway lined with offices until I came to one marked ""President's Office."" I stepped inside, and there sat President Kuklo, waiting for me.
""You're early,"" he said with a smile as I stepped inside his office. ""We were hoping you would come."" He gestured for me to sit in the chair across from him, so I did.
""Thank you for inviting us to your office today,"" I said as I took off my helmet and placed it on the floor next to me. The room was cool, but not uncomfortably cold like some of the buildings back on Earth. The air recyclers were efficient here, and the atmosphere was breathable.
The president nodded and smiled again. ""Thank you for coming, Doctor,"" he replied. ""I know you have a busy schedule, so I'll keep this brief. As I'm sure you've heard, we are having trouble with the colony's food supply. We haven't had any luck growing crops, and the soil is too thin to grow much of anything. Our food supplies are running out, and I need to get our agricultural team working on finding a solution.""
I was shocked by this news. The president hadn't mentioned that he was having any issues with the food supply. If he did, I must have missed it. ""What's your current ration status?"" I asked, trying to sound calm.
""Our rations last about three months, and we've used up half of them already,"" he answered. ""That means that if things don't improve soon, we won't be able to provide for our people for much longer. This is why I wanted to talk to you. I need you to help us find a way to solve this problem.""
My mind started racing. ""I'm afraid I don't have the experience you need for this,"" I told him honestly. ""I'm not trained in agriculture. You should ask Dr. Sato to come down here to Mars.""
""I know she's a scientist,"" President Kuklo said. ""But her job is to research how life originated on Earth, not to find a solution to a problem like this. And she's already working on something else at the moment. That's why I thought you might be a better person for the task.""
""You think I can do this?"" I asked him.
""Yes,"" he said with a nod. ""I have complete confidence in you.""
""Well,"" I said with a smile. ""That makes me feel better."" I paused for a few seconds before continuing. ""But let me tell you what I would need if I were going to help you out with this problem.""
""Go ahead,"" he said as he leaned back in his chair.
""First off, you need to send someone down to Earth to get some help,"" I said. ""They need to bring back soil samples from different locations around the planet. Then they need to mix it together in the labs so we can see if any of it has the ability to grow.""
""And how long will that take?"" he asked.
""It depends,"" I told him. ""The soil sample will only tell you part of the story. We need to do tests to see what kind of plant it might grow into."" I paused and took a deep breath before continuing. ""You're going to need at least one year, maybe two or three, to figure this out.""
""Do you have any other suggestions?"" he asked, leaning forward again.
""Well, another thing you could do is get more people involved,"" I told him. ""Maybe some of your political rivals who aren't currently on the council. If you had enough people working on it, it might make progress faster.""
""You think that's a good idea?"" he asked.
""Sure, why not? It'll get them out of their offices and doing something useful for once,"" I said with a laugh.
""I like it,"" President Kuklo said with a smile. ""We can send a message to the other members of the council and ask them if they'd be interested in helping out. Once they hear about the food supply problem, they'll probably want to get involved.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""But you also need to let them know that it will take a lot longer than one or two months to find a solution.""
""I agree with you on that,"" he said. ""And we'll need to make sure they understand that we can't just start growing crops out here on Mars. The plants need sunlight, which we don't have much of here on the planet.""
""I'll talk to Dr. Sato,"" I said. ""She's already working on some things with plants that can grow without the sun.""
""Good,"" President Kuklo said with a nod. ""Let me know when you've talked to her, and I'll put the word out to the others."" He stood up from his chair and looked down at me. ""Now, I'm going to go tell our agricultural team about this so they can start planning their next move. You can call me back if you have any questions.""
As the president left his office, I took a deep breath and sat back in my seat. I didn't really know what to think about the whole thing. We were going to have to work on a solution to the food shortage, but I wasn't sure how I was supposed to help with it. All I knew was that I would do whatever it took to keep our colony alive and thriving.

It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. At least it would last me through the night, but as I hurried through the city streets, I wondered how much longer I'd be able to keep waking up at four o'clock in the morning without feeling like I was going crazy or dying.
My walk down the long hallways toward the president's inner office was uneventful, and I got there just after 1 PM. As always, his assistant, Ms. Hsu, greeted me at the door when I arrived and led me into a small conference room where President Sato awaited. He had been working late the previous evening, so I knew he wanted to speak with me in private, which was why I'd asked Ms. Hsu to let him know I was coming.
When he opened the door and saw me, he stood up from behind his desk and smiled. ""Good afternoon, Mr. Smith,"" he said, extending his hand.
""Mr. President,"" I replied, clasping it firmly before letting go. We then sat down in front of his desk and he placed his own envelope on top of a stack of papers on his table. ""Did you sleep well?"" he asked me.
""Very well, thank you,"" I answered. ""Your letter was unexpected, but I've read it three times now.""
""And what did it tell you?"" he asked.
I hesitated. ""I don't think I should say,"" I told him. ""It contains sensitive information about our current situation.""
He frowned. ""Please forgive my lack of faith, Mr. Smith. I know you are well aware of all the events taking place at this very moment, and I am certain you will understand how important it is for us to share this information with each other.""
""You're right, sir,"" I said. ""But I have a promise to keep.""
""Then perhaps I can make this easier for you,"" he suggested. ""You have the option of reading the entire letter, or simply listening to me summarize its contents. Which do you prefer?""
I thought about the question a moment. ""How much time will it take me to listen to what you have to say?""
""Not long at all,"" he assured me. ""Perhaps five or ten minutes.""
""In that case,"" I answered, ""the letter will help me remember some of the details. If I read it myself, I won't pay as much attention.""
""Very well,"" he conceded. ""I'll begin.""
After he finished reading the entire message, he explained to me everything he had learned. I then listened to his summary, and after each paragraph, I wrote a brief notation in my notebook. Finally, when the interview was over, I thanked him and walked out of his office.
The walk back to my apartment was long, and I had to stop for a moment once I reached its doors to collect my thoughts. In many ways, the letter was disturbing, but I found myself more shocked by what I'd learned of our president's personal life than anything else. Not to mention the fact that his words were laced with enough hints as to who was involved in these events to leave no doubt in my mind.
As soon as I stepped inside my apartment, however, my mind began working overtime, and by the time I laid down for a nap, the letter and its contents were still fresh in my mind. The only thing that prevented me from falling immediately asleep was the thought that I needed to check the weather report before heading out again. So instead, I climbed out of bed and began preparing for another long, late-night walk into town.
It wasn't easy, and the heat was intense, but I managed to get to the weather station before the sunset. I was hoping to find some answers regarding what had happened at our research facility, but when I entered the building, there was nobody around. I tried my best to remain calm, and to think logically, but when I saw the blood spatter on the wall near the entrance, and when I realized the security guard's body was lying next to it, I couldn't help myself.
I ran outside and began screaming. I didn't even know what to say or why I was shouting, but I knew I had to make noise, so I continued screaming as if it would help me somehow. Then, after several moments of hysterics, I finally calmed down and looked around me. To my surprise, all the other people in the area had also noticed what was happening and were rushing toward me.
I could only imagine how terrified they must have felt. After all, no one in their right mind gets excited when they see someone scream. But the truth was, nobody in the crowd seemed too surprised to see me running around in the desert with tears flowing down my cheeks. They simply stared at me until I stopped crying and then walked away. I didn't care, though. I was relieved when I saw the police arrive and began questioning me.
I'm not sure how many questions were asked, but I remember being asked them all. When I didn't answer quickly enough or with the proper words, I was accused of using drugs or something similar. And although I was eventually freed and allowed to return home, they did take samples from me, and I was informed that I wouldn't be allowed to enter any restricted areas for two weeks. Fortunately, I'd made it home when all of this happened. Otherwise, I'm sure the police would have detained me for the duration of my trip to Mars.
I've never been so glad to see the inside of my apartment before. In fact, I'd almost forgotten how much I hated that place. It was so dark, the furniture was ugly, and the walls were stained with stains that no amount of cleaning would ever remove. The only thing I loved about it was the bed. It reminded me of the one I'd slept in at home, and despite the dirt and dust, there was nothing wrong with it. I was exhausted and went straight to sleep the second I crawled inside.
The first thing I did when I woke up the following morning was look out of my bedroom window. As I expected, the weather was beautiful, and the air was clear. That meant my walk into town was going to be nice and easy.
After a quick shower, I ate breakfast and headed out the door. My apartment was only a few kilometers from the center of town, so as soon as I stepped outside, I started walking in the opposite direction. By the time I'd gotten to the edge of the city, I was already sweating, and by the time I got to my destination, I was soaked.
That was my second surprise of the day—I'd assumed the weather was always like this, but I'd actually forgotten about the atmosphere being thinner here on Mars. As I approached the research station, my eyes began adjusting to the sunlight and I could see that something was definitely amiss. Most of the buildings there had been torn down, there was blood splattered all over the ground, and the smell of smoke mixed with death was in the air.
I decided to wait and see what the police wanted me to do, since it appeared to be my task to find out who was responsible for this mess.",1300,-1.2038149324091028,0.4389853884797084,-0.01918834062835214,0.9135181575490419,0.9941318057789106
43,R_241b5wcfQDv6QHx,FAN_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,Fandango,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature had risen to about 40 degrees Fahrenheit. It was going to be hot later on, but it would be even hotter in the city.
I made my way through the crowded streets until I got to the center of town near the public library. It wasn't as large or well-equipped as the one back home on Earth, but they still had enough books available so no one ever starved. The Martian colonists were a lot more practical than many people gave them credit for. There was a little park behind the library where people could come together and talk without being overheard. Some of the older residents liked to gather there when it was warm enough to go outside. Today it seemed to be just the sort of place President Halsey wanted to meet me.
I sat down next to one of the benches and waited for him to show up. A couple of young children came over and played with the sand next to me. One of them kicked some of it over, which caused me to look away from the sun for a few moments. When I looked back, I saw the president coming over with two of his aides. He was wearing a brown suit with a dark red tie. His pale skin was glowing under the harsh sunlight.
""Mr. O'Leary,"" he said to me when he reached me. ""You've done a fine job here already. I'm glad you're willing to help us.""
""Yes sir, thank you,"" I said respectfully. ""What can I do for you?""
The president smiled, seeming pleased by my response. ""There's quite a bit I'd like to tell you, actually. First, let me say that your friend is recovering nicely. Her parents seem very happy, and her brother says they'll be able to make contact again soon.""
""Oh, good!"" I replied, unable to keep myself from smiling too. ""Thank you for letting me know.""
The president nodded. ""You're welcome. Now then…I'd like you to join our mission to bring the other colonies into this new alliance we're forming. We've already sent letters to every inhabited planet in the galaxy, and now we need to start setting things up so we can start moving people and equipment to the colonies. Once that's all ready, we'll send the colonists out to establish a base on each planet before the war starts in earnest.""
""We don't want to be fighting the enemy on their terms,"" he continued. ""We'll be using the same tactics the Alliance used to defeat our enemies back home. If we can get our people and supplies safely to the colonies ahead of any other groups, then we'll be ready to take control there once the aliens arrive. You'll have plenty of support from us there. After that we'll move on to the other planets in the network until we're ready to attack the heart of their fleet.""
""Sounds like a good plan,"" I said. ""Are you sure I won't get my job back after all this?""
""Don't worry about that, Mr. O'Leary,"" replied the president. ""Your duties in the colony will be similar to what they are here on Earth. As you can imagine, we're working hard to prepare the rest of the colonies for your arrival.""
""Of course,"" I replied. It sounded like a great opportunity for me and others like me who weren't exactly suited for life on Mars, although it would mean I'd be taking a pay cut for doing this work. At the moment, the idea that I'd be better off than I was before appealed to me quite a bit. There wasn't much else I could do anyway.
We talked for another few minutes. The president asked me if I had any questions for him before we left, but I didn't. It seemed like he really wanted me to help and I wasn't going to be able to get away without volunteering to do something. So finally I decided to ask for a favor.
""If there's anything I can do to help, please tell me,"" I said seriously. ""Right now I'm pretty useless around here, and I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your confidence in me.""
The president looked slightly embarrassed. ""It's not a problem, Mr. O'Leary."" He turned to one of his aides. ""Get him to do whatever he needs to. And get someone to fix that mess he left this morning on top of the water tank.""
""Yes sir!"" replied the assistant loudly. ""I'll be right back."" He jogged toward the end of the path and disappeared from sight.
""I don't know what happened this morning,"" I said to the president, wondering why he had asked me that. ""But it wasn't intentional. I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to apologize.""
""Don't worry about it, Mr. O'Leary,"" said the president. ""As long as you're willing to work hard, I expect nothing else from you.""
""Thank you, sir.""
The president started walking away after giving me another nod. ""And Mr. O'Leary,"" he said just before disappearing from my view. ""Try not to kill anyone while you're down there. Okay?""
""I can try,"" I replied with a grin. ""Thank you again, sir."" I stood up and watched until he vanished into the crowd. I turned to find the guy I had been talking to earlier. Fortunately, I was wearing my name tag so I was able to remember his name. ""Hi! What was your name again?""
""Ivan,"" he replied. ""You can call me 'Ivan.'""
""Okay, Ivan. How'd you like to be my new sidekick and help me fight crime in our colony? We can put this big red cape you've got to use.""
""I think that might be overkill,"" said Ivan, chuckling, ""but I could come along to watch your back, if you want.""
""That would be great. Let's go!""
Ivan and I walked toward the public library, and when we arrived, we found the president waiting for me inside. He was standing next to the librarian, holding a book. ""Mr. O'Leary?"" the president asked, glancing over at me. ""I hope you're not planning to make a scene like you did last time.""
""No sir,"" I said with a smile. ""I promise I won't do it again.""
The president laughed. ""Good. I'm glad to hear that. You're still welcome here, and when you're done with all your tasks today, you're free to stay as long as you like.""
""Thank you, sir,"" I said, and we left the building. Ivan was staring at me with an amused expression on his face.
""So what happens if you decide to go against orders again?"" asked Ivan.
""They'll be able to stop me easily enough,"" I replied confidently, ""just like they stopped my friend before she even had a chance to speak.""
""I see."" Ivan shrugged. ""If you want to make a fool of yourself that much…"" He trailed off with a laugh. ""Well, whatever gets you through the day.""
""All right,"" I replied. ""Let's head over to the spaceport and find someone to help us get into space.""
On the way to the spaceport, Ivan told me a little bit about life on Mars, which was interesting.",1266,0.17817869210668208,-0.409936838205212,0.09279317811021728,0.6266778242050884,1.0421240430878513
44,R_3NClWxhjmmabCmm,MOR_HR_6,Historical Romance,Morpho,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd taken her order—a pitcher of beer and a plate of cheese, bread, and sausage—and had gone to fetch it. When he returned, she was still sitting there.
She was dressed in a simple dress, the fabric rough and brown and very familiar. He knew the smell of it, and it was the smell of home. He'd been away for so long that he almost didn't recognize the dress as one of his mother's. At first he thought she was a runaway who'd taken refuge in his mother's house, and he had started to think about what he would do if that was the case. He hadn't realized that she was a girl until he had put the pitcher of beer on the table in front of her and she'd stood to take it from him.
She was a girl, a young woman really, but he still couldn't get over the thought that she was a runaway. He could see it in her eyes. There were still a lot of questions he had about what had happened to bring her to this place and what she was doing there, but there was no point in asking them now. She'd paid for the beer and left without saying a word.
And so he'd sat with his beer until the tavern closed that night, staring at the spot where she'd been sitting.
The next day he went to his mother's house and asked if she had a runaway daughter staying with her.
She hadn't, but she'd said something about a strange young woman coming to the house on the day before. She hadn't known anything about her.
That night he'd gone to work at the tavern again, but this time he sat at one of the tables in front of them. He'd pretended to be waiting for an order, just to see if she would come back.
She had come back that night with another pitcher of beer and a plate of cheese, bread, and sausage. He hadn't taken her order this time but stayed at his table and watched her eat. She was polite to everyone else around her but didn't look him in the eye once when she sat down at his table. She ate silently and then left.
But the next night she came back again. The next day and the next night after that too. She even brought gifts for his mother—a bottle of wine for her and a basket of cheese, bread, and sausage for him. When she came in the last night, she looked him directly in the eye and smiled. She said nothing about why she was there or why she always sat at his table. She paid for her beer and left again without saying anything.
The next morning he woke up with a pounding headache—he'd only drunk one pitcher of beer last night—and went out on his horse to look for her. He wandered around for days until he finally found her sitting by herself in a tavern along the road to Zilva. He sat down with her and drank his beer while she ate some cheese and sausage from her basket.
""How did you come to be here?"" he asked after a while.
She laughed at him. ""I don't remember,"" she said. ""I don't remember anything about myself.""
""What did you do?"" he asked.
""I ran away,"" she said simply. ""I don't remember how.""
""Why?""
""I don't know,"" she said again. ""I don't remember.""
""I see."" He nodded slowly. ""How old are you?""
She looked down at the table between them where her basket sat beside him. ""I'm not sure,"" she said after a while. ""I don't remember.""
He looked at her searchingly, trying not to stare at her as he did so, but she didn't look away from him when he did so anyway. After a while, he looked back down at his own basket and continued eating slowly so that he didn't have to look up again at her face too quickly.
""What's your name?"" he asked after a while.
""I don't know,"" she said quietly after a while as well, looking down at her basket again where it sat next to him on the table between them again as well. ""I don't remember.""
""How old are you?"" he asked quietly after a minute or two more of silence between them both as they ate cheese and sausage from their baskets without saying anything else for a time now.
She looked at him again, and this time there was anger in her eyes when she looked up at him again as well. ""Do you really want to know?"" she asked after a moment or two of silence between them again now as well though.",830,-1.2083776193647884,-1.8904903721992334,0.006102246974125242,-1.429626577281123,-0.9176772993926009
45,R_AM55muvcivHG0XD,MOR_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,Morpho,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The rest of the day, however, was spent on another project. I was working on the code that would ultimately make it possible to communicate with the rest of the world, both on Earth and in space. Of course, I didn't have time to do so at the moment, seeing as I had to meet with the president of Mars.
It was not difficult to find his office, but I had to wait in a queue for a while before I got inside. It was not long until his secretary called me in, and I was asked to sit down and wait again.
The president's office was rather small, perhaps two or three meters by four. A man sat at a desk at one end, and another stood by the door. He was probably part of the secret service. When I saw that, I thought for a moment that I was going to be arrested.
""I'm sorry about all this,"" said a voice from behind me. ""It's just that we get so many visitors that we need to be careful.""
The man who had spoken to me was tall and thin, with light brown hair that looked like it had been combed straight back. He wore a suit that looked like it had been tailored for him specifically.
""If you'd like, you could go down to the cafeteria and get something to eat while you wait,"" he said. ""It's on the third floor.""
I stood up and followed him up the stairs, past a few more secretaries who were busy at work. On the third floor there was a vending machine, and it offered food from Earth. I bought a few sandwiches and then returned to my seat.
I ate my sandwiches while waiting for my turn to see the president. I did not want to be rude and leave without eating, but I wanted to be on time for my meeting with him.
Finally, after what felt like hours, it was my turn to meet with him. He had told me he would only have time for a quick chat, and he did not disappoint.
""Hello,"" he said and shook my hand when I got to his desk. ""My name is President Thomas Rochat. How are you?""
""Fine, thank you,"" I said as I looked at him and offered him my hand in return. ""My name is Dr. Adam Thomas.""
""I know who you are,"" he said as he shook my hand firmly. ""I'd heard some things about you from Dr. Sato.""
""Is that right?"" I asked him as I looked at him for a moment. ""What did she say?""
""She said that you were working on something really important.""
""That's right,"" I told him with a smile on my face. ""I'm working on a program that will allow us to communicate with people on Earth.""
""Is that right?"" he asked again. ""That's great! When do you think it will be finished?""
""We're not quite sure yet,"" I said as I tried not to sound like I was lying to him. ""We're hoping it will be ready by next week.""
""That'll be amazing!"" he said with a smile on his face. ""I can't wait to see it!""
We talked for a while longer, and then he gave me an envelope with his personal seal on it and told me that he hoped everything went well with my project.
I walked out of his office and then went back downstairs to get something to eat. My head was spinning because of all the information I had just learned about him, but I wasn't really sure what was true and what wasn't. However, even if the man was not actually president of Mars, he certainly acted like he was in charge there.
As soon as I got back upstairs though, the secretary called me into his office again to tell me that they wanted me to start work on Monday morning in order to be ready for when the program was ready. She handed me another envelope with my new office address written on it before telling me goodbye and wishing me good luck with my project.
I walked back down the stairs and out of the building for the last time until Monday morning when I arrived at my new workstation on Mars' Red Planet in order to begin my new job as an IT specialist in space communications.<|endoftext|>

46,R_Tt7OZ9dyCIGiqZP,GEN_HF_4,High Fantasy,Genesis,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. There were no people, only horses tethered to posts that seemed to be part of an old stable.
A man stepped out from behind one of the nearby buildings and approached them as they rode into town. He had been thin and sickly even before he'd come down with a fever following his encounter with the shadow-beasts. Now he was gaunt and frail, though his eyes remained bright. His hair was matted with sweat and dirt, and there were several days' worth of stubble covering his chin.
""I'm sorry I wasn't here to meet you,"" he said, holding out his hand. ""It's just... well...""
Tristan took the older man's hand without hesitation and shook it firmly. ""No apologies are necessary.""
He turned his horse around and led them toward the gate of the village. ""Please, dismount and stay on the ground. No one wants to see your faces until you're ready. If any of our neighbors see you, we could lose everything.""
They did as instructed and followed him through the gates. He pointed to a large building near the center of the village. ""You can put your things inside. The innkeeper will take good care of them for us while we're gone.""
Tristan nodded in thanks and led his friends to the inn. They followed him up a flight of stairs that opened onto a second floor. Four doors lined the walls to either side, each with a piece of paper pinned to the wood next to it. Their host explained what they meant.
""Room 1 is yours if you want it. Room 2, 3, and 4 are mine. I'll try not to keep you awake too late.""
Vlora had been looking over the room numbers as Tristan gave his explanation. She pointed to number three. ""That's my room?""
""It's fine,"" Tristan assured her. ""There's something odd about this place, but I don't think anyone has ever gotten hurt.""
She frowned. ""And you didn't think we should know that?""
He shrugged. ""If I thought it would make a difference, I would have told you. You've got nothing to worry about.""
He went back downstairs to check on the horses while Vlora and Yvonne unpacked their bags. When she was done, Vlora walked back upstairs to find Tristan still standing outside the door to the room. He stood with his arms crossed, staring at the wooden sign hanging above the door.
""What does it say?""
Tristan tapped his foot impatiently. ""Nothing. It doesn't say anything. But every time I look at it, I get an uneasy feeling. I keep thinking it means something.""
""Perhaps you're nervous because it seems abandoned,"" Vlora suggested. ""Have you seen how far away it is? There are no signs of life within miles. No farmers, no caravans, no traders. It's quiet except for the sound of the river and a few birds.""
""Maybe,"" he allowed, ""but it feels wrong to me.""
""What do you mean?""
He held up the sign again. ""This says 'The Inn at the End of the World.' What kind of inn has an end?""
Vlora stared at the sign. ""Good point.""
""I suppose I shouldn't be surprised,"" Vlora added. ""We're in the middle of nowhere after all. It wouldn't be strange to find ourselves alone.""
Tristan's expression darkened. ""You know, I always wondered why we never saw another soul on those journeys. We traveled a great distance through places where other armies might have made camp. The Empire should be in a position to see us coming, and yet we passed through dozens of towns and villages, and no one ever came out to greet us. In some ways, it almost felt like we were being ignored.""
""They weren't ignoring us, Tris,"" Vlora said gently. ""They were just taking precautions. You have to understand—the Empire is very dangerous. They've conquered much of the continent and now they're trying to expand. People who live in these parts are understandably worried about the Empire.""
He nodded slowly, but his mood hadn't improved. ""Maybe that's true. Maybe they were just scared. But I don't think so.""
""Why not?""
He sighed. ""Because I was there. All the way at the front of the line, marching hard and fast to the border. I remember seeing a lot of fear and terror, but I also remember knowing that they were afraid of me. They were terrified of me.""
Vlora frowned. ""I don't understand.""
""I'm sure you don't. But I met the enemy. I spoke to them face-to-face. And I know they feared me because I am the Beast of War. That's what they called me.""
""What?""
Tristan smiled bitterly. ""I wasn't lying to you when I said it was a long story. I spent years fighting against the Empire, and I learned a lot. One of the things I learned was that there are many names for me: The Beast of War, the Destroyer, and a few others. But the name I liked best was the one they used to address me directly. The name they called me first.""
""What's that?""
""The Beast of War. They called me that because I killed everyone.""
Vlora stared at him blankly, and he realized that she wouldn't believe him unless he showed her. He reached into his pack and pulled out the letter he'd received from the Redeemers. ""Look at this. This is the letter I received from the Redeemer general after I returned to the capital. You know, the one that was intercepted by the Empire and brought to the Emperor? Look.""
He handed her the missive.
She read it quickly, then folded it back up and handed it back. ""I don't understand. How could you have killed thousands of people without anyone noticing?""
""Because I was the Beast of War,"" he replied flatly.
Vlora shook her head. ""That doesn't make sense. You defeated the entire army of the Empire single-handedly.""
""Yes, I did. I slew the emperor himself. I destroyed the palace and burned the city of Ostrander to the ground. I slaughtered the entire Imperial Guard and left over thirty thousand dead in my wake.""",1092,0.27111392420833974,1.0371051687718877,0.18109224972341212,-0.02516915350223011,0.07508357658046284

It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The temperature today had reached 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and there were even some clouds overhead to keep things cool. The atmosphere had thinned enough to allow them to form, but they quickly dissipated as the sun beat down on them. There are very few trees or plants native to Mars, so most of the oxygen is produced by the hundreds of thousands of solar panels spread across the planet's surface. They're not just used to generate energy either; the wind turbines on top of each one pump air up through the blades and disperse it around the world.
Mars has two moons now, Phobos and Deimos, which orbit close to the planet and occasionally get sucked into its gravity well. This causes what scientists call a 'dust storm', and it happens every couple of years when a big cloud forms near the equator. These storms can reach 50 feet high and cover a quarter of the planet in dust and sand that blocks out sunlight. With no atmosphere to hold it back, it blows out into space until it reaches the outer limits of the planet's magnetic field, where the winds finally die down.
It's been nearly four months since my last meeting with President Thomas, and he'd called me a week earlier to let me know that he wanted to talk again about my work. I'm glad he still wants to hear about my progress, even though he didn't come out and say why. I think he may be getting nervous about the future.
The president's office was located inside the presidential palace on Olympus Mons. As one of our largest volcanoes, Olympus Mons towers above the rest of the planet and is visible from anywhere in the northern hemisphere. It's also the tallest mountain on any planet outside of Earth, standing almost 14 miles tall. We've found evidence that there once existed an ocean underneath its icy cap, although it would have been several kilometers deep. Because of all the water vapor in the atmosphere, the surface is covered with a thick layer of ice, which makes it difficult to drill through without cracking. The only way to access the interior of Olympus Mons is via a network of tunnels dug deep into the rock.
There are dozens of buildings inside the palace, ranging from offices to apartments to dormitories for visiting delegations. But the most important rooms are the ones that contain the president's office and his private quarters. In fact, visitors are required to pass through three checkpoints before being allowed past security doors and into the main lobby.
Once I got inside, I passed through another set of doors and headed toward the elevator banks. There were six elevators in total, each one dedicated to a different floor. While the president's private suite was on the top floor, the first level was reserved for government officials, including senators, cabinet members, and other political leaders. Then there were five floors below that, each one housing a different administrative division within the Martian Defense Force.
As I walked down the hallway, I noticed a number of armed guards standing along the walls, watching everything going on. I thought it was kind of strange that the president would need such protection, especially considering that he wasn't doing anything controversial. He was just trying to make sure his people lived long enough to see the next generation take over.
When I reached the elevator bank, I pressed my thumb against the scanner and waited patiently while the computer checked to see if I had any outstanding warrants. Once it verified that I was clean, the doors opened, and I stepped inside. Two more guards stood inside. Unlike the others, they weren't dressed in full uniform and had their weapons holstered.
""What floor?"" asked one of them.
""Olympus Level One.""
We rode the elevator up to the top floor. When the doors opened, I saw a large room filled with expensive furniture. A man dressed in a black suit sat behind a desk, looking down at something on his screen. The door was closed, blocking off any sound from the hall, so I couldn't hear him talking.
""Welcome to the office of the president of the United States,"" said the guard who'd met me at the door. He pointed to a small table beside the entrance, where a young boy was sitting alone. ""Please make yourself comfortable, Mr. Wilson, and the president will be right with you.""
I moved to the side of the table and waited patiently as the other guard went back around the corner. His footsteps faded away into the distance, and all I could hear was the rustling of papers coming from the desk. After a minute or so, I heard him walk back into view.
""You wanted to see me?""
""Yes, sir,"" answered the president. ""Your work is progressing nicely, although there are a few issues we need to discuss. Can I offer you some refreshments? Coffee maybe?""
""No thanks. I'm fine.""
""Excellent. Now, let's begin.""
He turned to look at the monitor on his desk. ""Ah, good. You've finished the preliminary report on your work so far.""
""Yes, sir.""
""Thank you, Mr. Wilson. I'll review it later tonight, but for now I want to ask about the project team. So far, they seem like an impressive group.""
""They are. Doctor Sato is an exceptional scientist. She's been working tirelessly to find a cure for the zombie plague, and she seems to be making real progress. Plus, she's helping to create a vaccine that can be mass produced.""
""That's excellent news. How many people do you have working on the project?""
""About thirty at the moment, plus a handful of technicians and engineers.""
""And how soon is this new vaccine expected to be ready?""
""Three months. If we have enough funding, we should be able to complete the research and development phase in time.""
""I'm glad to hear that. And what about the human test subjects? Are there any volunteers yet?""
""Not yet.""
""But you're working on that, right?""
""Yes, sir. We've found a facility that specializes in testing drugs on humans. We're hoping to start the trials shortly after we finish building the lab.""
""Good. I'm sure you're aware of the recent outbreak of zombies. It's spreading throughout the population faster than anyone anticipated. The military is doing everything they can to contain the disease, but it's proving to be quite a challenge. We're running out of time, and we need to find a solution as soon as possible. I don't want to wait until millions of people are infected before we act.""
""Understood. I'll make sure they understand that.""
""Good. Make sure you do. We need to implement a plan of action immediately.",1192,-0.2106463474037684,0.6788922033685237,0.8727656370513858,1.01316579652186,-0.5614366400611116
48,R_29teQzxFOvFJPLI,LOW_HSF_4,Hard Sci-Fi,Low Rider,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. That meant only one thing. Winter would be coming soon. In fact, winter had already begun back on Earth; there would be snow on the ground by now if we were still there. Still, even though it wasn't as cold here, winter came every year just like it did down below.
It didn't take long until I arrived at the main building on site where we had been stationed for nearly eight months. We'd lived in an old military base that had originally been built to house soldiers during wartime. Now, however, it served mostly as an administration center. Inside, I found myself surrounded by people wearing uniforms—some of them wearing NASA ones, others belonging to various branches of the UN Space Force. All of us looked busy with our tasks, but there were always plenty of people standing around waiting for something or someone. As I approached the reception area, an older man with white hair noticed me approaching. He got up from his desk and walked towards me, extending his hand.
""Mr. Jones? The president himself asked us to give this to you personally."" His face broke out into a wide smile, revealing teeth stained yellow by cigarettes. ""The president would like to speak with you as soon as possible. Is three o'clock okay?""
I nodded before accepting the letter. ""Sure. Just let me grab my things and then we'll head over.""
He waved goodbye before returning to his chair behind the counter and resuming work. It took about fifteen minutes for me to collect all of my belongings and put everything away inside my bag. By the time I was ready, another man had appeared next to me. He was a bit younger than me, with a neatly trimmed beard and brown eyes that reminded me of the sea.
""You must be Mr. Jones?"" he said. I gave him a small nod and he extended his hand towards me. ""My name is Colonel Davenport. I'm a representative of the President of Earth and Mars. You may call me 'John.' May I ask what your connection with the president is?""
""We're both ex-astronauts,"" I answered immediately. ""He's actually the one who sent us to Mars to start with.""
He smiled. ""Ah, yes, I heard about you two being sent down here after the failure of Project Blue. Well, I'm glad to hear you've been doing so well.""
""Yeah, it's definitely turned out better than expected. Although, if they ever figure out how to send humans into space, we'll probably be back.""
""Well, I can say I don't envy you guys anymore."" He chuckled and I could tell he was trying to make light of the situation. I laughed along with him. We shook hands again before parting ways.
When we reached the presidential offices, I followed John down several halls lined with portraits of the previous presidents of Mars. They looked serious in their pictures, but the one we were heading towards was smiling widely and holding a big book in his arms. It was hard to tell exactly which president he represented because he looked young, and I couldn't quite see any distinguishing features that might have helped to identify him. When we finally reached the end of the corridor, he gestured towards a set of double doors made of steel plates and told me to go in first. I did so and found myself standing in front of an oval window, looking out onto the city of New York. There were people walking around everywhere, but not enough to fill the streets. A few cars drove by, but none of them stopped near the road to let anyone on or off. Instead, everyone just used the elevated rails to get wherever they needed to go.
""Hello again, Mr. Jones,"" said a familiar voice, startling me. ""It's nice to see you again after all this time. Please, come inside.""
A tall man in a white robe emerged from behind the glass window, waving to me as he spoke. I hadn't seen him since I left Earth almost ten years ago. Then again, I hadn't gone back to visit my parents either.
""How are you?"" I asked as he approached me.
""I'm fine, thank you,"" he responded. ""Please, come inside.""
Once I crossed the threshold, we sat down across a table covered by a blue cloth, each of us having our own seat. He handed me the letter he had given me earlier and I opened it to read. It said simply: ""I hope things are going well for you in your new home.""
""So far so good. I'm really enjoying it here.""
""That's great news,"" he replied. ""As I'm sure you know, this isn't always the case. We usually don't have anyone leave Earth and find a place here on Mars, although it happens more frequently than most people think. What do you mean when you say 'it happens more frequently than people think?'""
""Well, there was this one guy—""
""—who went missing after he left Earth,"" interrupted the president. ""Didn't you hear about it?""
""Not really,"" I admitted. ""I didn't really pay attention to the news.""
""Oh, right. I forgot you haven't been following it closely since you've been on Mars. Anyway, the reason we're having this meeting is that we'd like to invite you to return home. It's time for you to go back.""
I stared at him blankly for a moment before realizing he was serious. My mouth hung open and I felt my cheeks grow hot as I looked away from him. This could not be happening! After all these years, he wanted me to go home? ""Why?"" I managed to utter at last. ""What about you? Aren't you supposed to stay here until your term ends?""
""Yes, but that doesn't change anything for you, does it?"" he replied. ""If I want to return to Earth, it won't stop you from staying here, will it?""
I thought about it for a moment while I chewed on my lip. ""No… I suppose it wouldn't.""
""Then it looks like the decision is out of my hands."" He smiled. ""Although, I still don't know why you never told anyone where you were planning to go when you left Earth.""
I shrugged. ""You know how it goes. Things happen unexpectedly. Besides, there was nothing wrong with leaving Earth to live on Mars.""
""You're right about that, but we would have been much better prepared to deal with you if we knew where you were.""
""But you did anyway, didn't you?""
""I sent you messages telling you to contact us if you ever needed help."" He nodded. ""We should have done more to keep tabs on you when you were here too, but no one expected you to become an astronaut in the first place. We didn't even know that astronauts existed until you showed up, after all.""",1212,1.6577817752038235,1.3338992514067365,0.2761518105124936,1.0030426001197568,1.0340112479165826
49,R_3gZsTs0GQ1i2rrM,BAS_HR_3,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been so stunned by her beauty that for an instant he couldn't even think or speak. Then she turned to look back at him over her shoulder with those eyes—those beautiful, dark eyes—and it had all begun.
He knew her name then because she told him, but he didn't know who she was or why she was there. All he did know was that if she hadn't spoken, he would have forgotten about her completely.
But she spoke, and he listened.
""I need your help,"" she said, and when he asked what kind of help, she looked away from him as though embarrassed. ""My father has gone missing.""
Her voice was low and husky, and he could feel the warmth of her breath on his cheek. It made him want to lean closer, to see more of her, to touch her. But he kept himself still.
She continued speaking, telling him how she'd left home several months earlier without saying goodbye to anyone. Her mother had died years ago, leaving her alone with only her father, and now he wasn't answering his door.
It sounded like something out of a fairy tale. And yet it seemed very real, and he wanted nothing more than to find her father for her. So he went to work searching through every nook and cranny of the city, asking questions, trying to learn anything he could about her father. He found no trace of him anywhere.
And then, three days later, she came into the tavern again, and this time he remembered everything about her. The way her hair fell around her shoulders; the way she moved her body as she talked; the softness of her lips when they smiled at him.
That smile was like a knife in his chest.
""You've done well,"" she said, smiling at him. ""I'm sure you'll find my father soon.""
He nodded, but inside he felt hollowed-out. He knew that if he didn't find her father for her, she wouldn't be happy, and he hated seeing her unhappy.
So he kept looking. For two weeks, he searched everywhere he could think of, but there were no leads whatsoever. Finally, after returning to the tavern one evening, he realized that he needed help. So he called upon his friend, a former soldier who was now working as a private investigator, and together they began their search anew.
They spent most of the next month following up on every lead they could find, until finally, one day, the PI's phone rang.
""What is it?"" he asked.
""We have him,"" the man said.
""Who? Where?""
""A small town outside the city. We're going now to pick him up. I'll call you when we get back.""
""How long will that take?""
""Two hours, maybe less.""
""Okay, thanks,"" the PI replied, and hung up.
When he got off the phone, he told the tavern owner what was happening.
""Do you want me to stay here while you go with him?"" the owner asked.
""No, I don't think so,"" the PI answered. ""If we can catch him, it should be easy enough to bring him back here.""
""All right. Be careful,"" the tavern owner said.
Then the PI walked out the door, and the tavern owner watched him leave. A few minutes later, the PI returned.
""Is there any place nearby where he might have hidden himself?"" the tavern owner asked.
The PI shook his head. ""There are plenty of places he could hide, but none of them seem likely. If he wanted to disappear, he would have taken some money with him. He wouldn't just run away empty-handed.""
""Well, let's hope he took something with him,"" the tavern owner said, and then he followed the PI out the door.
They drove down the road toward the small town, and once they reached the outskirts of the city, they turned onto a dirt path. After driving for another ten minutes, the PI stopped the car. They both got out and stood beside the vehicle.
""Are you ready?"" the PI asked.
The tavern owner nodded.
""Good luck,"" the PI said, and then he started walking.
The tavern owner followed, keeping his distance from the PI, watching him closely. When they reached the edge of the woods, the tavern owner paused for a moment before stepping forward into the trees.
He waited there for a minute, listening carefully to the sounds of the forest. Then he heard footsteps approaching from behind him. He turned slowly and saw the PI standing there.
""Where is he?"" the tavern owner asked.
""In the clearing ahead of us. Go on, hurry!""
The tavern owner stepped through the brush and emerged in the clearing. There was a fire burning in the center of the space, and sitting by the flames was a man. The tavern owner recognized him immediately.
""Father?"" he said.
The man looked up at him, and the tavern owner rushed forward to embrace him.
""I thought you were dead,"" he whispered.
""I am,"" the man replied. ""I died last year. But I didn't want to leave you alone. You're all I have left now.""
""I'm sorry, Father. I never meant to hurt you.""
""It doesn't matter anymore. Now we can be together forever.""
The tavern owner looked at the man sitting by the fire, and he saw that his father was wearing a white robe.
""Is that your ghost?"" he asked.
His father nodded. ""Yes, son. That's my spirit. It will always be with you, wherever you go.""
""Will it follow me to the grave?""
His father smiled. ""Of course not. It can't do that.""
""Why not?""
""Because it's part of you now. It's a part of your soul, and that cannot be destroyed. It will live on inside you until the end of time.""
""Thank you, Father,"" the tavern owner said, and then he embraced him again.
After a moment, the tavern owner released his father and turned to leave.
""Wait,"" his father said.
The tavern owner turned back to face him.
""Take care of yourself,"" his father said. ""Don't forget who you are. And remember, you have to keep looking for her.""
The tavern owner nodded. ""I won't forget, Father. I promise.""
""Goodbye, Son,"" his father said, and then he disappeared.
The tavern owner stared at the spot where his father had been, and then he turned and walked back through the forest. He didn't look back.
He didn't need to.

50,R_1BVsJ1QHcsGuM8h,BAS_HF_9,High Fantasy,Basic Coherence,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is where we'll be staying?"" asked Kari as she gazed around the area. ""It looks pretty empty.""
""There are several other villages scattered about,"" said Jori-an, ""but this one has always been our home. We have lived here since before your ancestors were born. There's no need for us to move elsewhere. You will find that most people who live in these parts tend to stay put unless there's a good reason to do otherwise.""
Kari nodded as her eyes took in the sights around them. They had traveled northward from the city of Ilin Illan, and now found themselves deep within the southern continent. She'd heard stories of how vast and varied the lands of Terrelan could be, and she wondered if those tales were true. At least it seemed peaceful enough so far.
They made their way down the road leading to the village until they came upon a large wooden gate. Kari stopped and turned to look back at her companions. ""I'm going to go knock on that door and see what happens.""
Jori-an smiled. ""You're welcome to try. If you want to leave me behind, though, I won't stop you.""
""No, thank you,"" said Kari. ""I've never seen anything like this before, and I think it would be nice to learn more about my heritage.""
She knocked on the door, which opened almost immediately after she did so. An old man stood before her. He looked to be in his seventies at best, and he wore simple clothes, but he carried himself with dignity and pride. His hair was white, and he sported a neatly trimmed beard.
""Greetings,"" he said. ""I am Bortis, the mayor of this town.""
Kari bowed slightly. ""My name is Karian Vanador, and I come seeking an audience with the elders of your tribe.""
Bortis frowned. ""What is it you seek? Do you wish to join us?""
Kari shook her head. ""I don't believe that's possible. I'm not even sure why I'm here. I just know that I have a calling to serve my people, wherever they may be.""
Bortis gave her a long, thoughtful look. ""We have many visitors here every year. Many come to seek our wisdom and guidance. Few return, however. What makes you different?""
Kari shrugged. ""I can only tell you that I feel a pull toward this place. I felt it when I first saw it, and I still feel it now. I hope that you'll let me speak with the elders. Perhaps they can help me understand what I'm feeling.""
Bortis nodded. ""Come inside, then. I'll take you to them.""
He led Kari through the gate and into the village proper. As they walked, she noticed that the buildings were constructed of stone and wood, and everything appeared to be well maintained. The streets were clean, and the people she passed seemed friendly. There didn't seem to be any children running around, but there were plenty of adults tending to chores and working on projects.
They soon came to a building that looked similar to the one where Kari had stayed in Ilin Illan, except this one was larger and had more rooms. A group of men and women sat in chairs around a table in the center of the room, and they all rose as Bortis approached them. One of the men stepped forward and extended his hand. ""Welcome, stranger. I am Larnis, and I will be your guide today. My friends and I are the elders of this village. We will answer whatever questions you may have, but I must warn you that we cannot give you answers to things beyond our knowledge. I hope you understand.""
Kari nodded. ""Of course. Thank you for having me.""
Larnis gestured to another chair, and Kari took a seat across from him. He pointed to the others, and they all returned to their seats. ""Let's start with something easy. Where are we?""
Kari thought for a moment. ""I'm not entirely sure. I haven't been outside of the city for a very long time, so I really couldn't say.""
""Well, that's not too surprising. Most of us here don't leave the valley much, either. I suppose we could ask someone else to find out for us, but it wouldn't be prudent to reveal our location to anyone who might wish to harm us. That's why we keep our gates locked at night, and why we don't allow strangers to wander about freely. We have enemies, and they would be quick to exploit any weaknesses in our defenses.""
Kari nodded. ""That makes sense. I guess I should have expected as much.""
Larnis leaned forward. ""Do you have any idea who your parents are? Are you able to trace your lineage back to any particular family?""
""Not really. I've never known my father, and I don't remember ever seeing my mother. I grew up in a temple in Ilin Illan, and I never knew my real name until recently. I was given the name 'Karian' by a priestess named Erynna, and I adopted it as my own. I have no idea who my parents are, or if I even have any living relatives.""
Larnis nodded. ""So, you have no idea who your people are?""
Kari shook her head. ""None whatsoever. All I know is that I was raised in the temple of Zalkar, and that I'm called to serve him.""
""And yet you wear the armor of the Order of the Dark Knights,"" said one of the other elders. ""Is that not a contradiction in terms?""
Kari shrugged. ""I don't know. I've never thought about it. I've always worn the armor, and I've never questioned it. I suppose I've simply taken it as a sign from God that I should follow the path laid out for me.""
One of the elders frowned. ""Perhaps you should consider doing so. We can offer you guidance and protection, but only if you choose to accept it.""
Kari smiled. ""I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid I already have a protector. I've been blessed with a calling, and I intend to follow it.""
Another elder spoke up. ""You mentioned a calling. Have you received any visions or dreams?""
Kari nodded. ""Yes. I've had several over the past few months. I can't explain them, but I know they're important. I think I'm supposed to travel to a place called Varda, and there I'll meet an angel named Azrael.""
The elders exchanged glances. ""Varda is the name of our goddess,"" said one of them.",1163,-0.3698319384838215,-1.3889164442045023,-0.17675904062422562,-0.48337064643366634,-0.08414997286788692

She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been so busy serving that he hadn't noticed her until she spoke to him. Her voice was as beautiful as she looked—soft, melodious, and mesmerizing. But it wasn't just her voice that made him pause. It was the fact that she didn't look anything like the other women who frequented the place. The others were dressed in fine clothes and jewelry, but this woman wore a simple dress of homespun wool with no adornments. And yet there was something about her that drew him to her. Something more than beauty.
He watched her for several minutes before he finally turned away from the bar and walked over to her table. ""Can I get you something?"" he asked politely.
""A glass of your best wine,"" she replied.
She sounded almost bored by his question. His heart thudded wildly in his chest as he reached out and poured her a small cupful of red liquid. Then he took the empty cup back to the bar and refilled it. When he returned, she smiled at him.
Her smile lit up the room. She was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. She had long, dark hair that fell in waves around her shoulders, and eyes so blue they seemed to glow. They reminded him of the ocean on a bright day.
""Thank you,"" she said.
His name is Nicholas, he thought, but he couldn't bring himself to say it aloud. Instead, he bowed slightly and left. As he walked back toward the bar, he heard her call after him, ""You're very kind.""
Nicholas glanced back, surprised that she knew his name. He nodded briefly and went back behind the bar.
When he finished serving all the customers and put everything away, he decided to go outside for some fresh air. As he stepped out onto the street, he saw her walking down the lane toward the tavern. She paused when she saw him and then continued on her way. He stood there watching her until she disappeared inside the building.
That night he dreamed of her. In his dream she was sitting beside him at a table in the tavern, drinking from the same cup he had given her earlier. She looked up at him and smiled, and he felt a sudden rush of desire. When he woke up, he lay in bed thinking about her.
In the days that followed, he tried to think of little else. Every time he went to work, he would see her and watch her. At times he would even catch her staring at him. Once or twice she actually spoke to him. But each time she did, he found himself unable to speak.
One evening, he was standing near the bar talking to another man when she came in. This time, she approached him and asked if she could sit with them. Nicholas hesitated only a moment before nodding his head. She sat down next to him and ordered a drink.
""What's your name?"" she asked.
""Nicholas,"" he answered automatically.
""I'm Anna,"" she said.
It was the first time he'd spoken to her directly. ""My name is Nicholas,"" he repeated.
Anna looked at him curiously. ""Are you sure?"" she asked.
""Yes,"" he said.
She leaned closer to him. ""Why don't you tell me what you really are?""
Nicholas stared at her for a moment, wondering why she wanted to know. Then he shrugged. ""I am a servant,"" he said simply.
""No!"" she exclaimed. ""You can't be. You're too handsome.""
He laughed. ""So I've been told,"" he admitted.
Anna blushed and looked down at the table.
Nicholas reached out and touched her hand. ""Don't worry,"" he said softly. ""I won't hurt you.""
She lifted her gaze to meet his. ""I'm not afraid of you,"" she whispered.
For a few moments, they gazed at each other. Then Nicholas took her hand and kissed it.
""I must leave now,"" he said.
""Where will you go?"" she asked.
""To my home,"" he replied.
""But you have nowhere to live,"" she protested.
""I'll find somewhere,"" he assured her.
She smiled at him. ""Good-bye, Nicholas.""
As he walked away, he wondered whether she would remember him.
The following week, he went to the tavern every day. Each time he saw her, he tried to talk to her, but she always turned away. Finally, on the third day, she stopped and spoke to him.
""Do you want to go for a walk?"" she asked.
He looked at her in surprise. ""Is that allowed?"" he asked.
""Of course,"" she said.
They walked along the lane together, holding hands. After a while, Anna began to tell him about herself. She told him about her family and how her father had died when she was young. She talked about her brothers and sisters and how hard life was for them without their parents. She told him about her dreams and hopes for the future.
Then she looked at him and smiled. ""Will you marry me?""
Nicholas felt his heart pounding. ""Yes,"" he said.
""We should celebrate,"" she said.
""How?"" he asked.
""Let's go to the tavern,"" she suggested.
""All right,"" he agreed.
""And we can invite everyone,"" she added.
""Everyone?"" he echoed.
""Yes,"" she replied.
""But—""
""It will be fun,"" she insisted.
""I suppose it will,"" he said reluctantly.
She led him to the tavern and showed him to a small table in the corner. There were already several people seated there, including the innkeeper and his wife.
""This is Nicholas,"" she explained to them. ""He has promised to marry me.""
The innkeeper frowned. ""That's good,"" he said.
""Who are these other men?"" Nicholas asked.
""These are my friends,"" Anna replied.
""Friends?"" he asked.
""Yes,"" she said. ""They're going to help us plan our wedding.""
Nicholas stared at her. ""Plan a wedding?""
""Yes,"" she replied. ""It's customary.""
""Well, I guess so,"" he muttered.
""There's a lot to do,"" Anna said. ""First, we need to decide on a date.""
""Why?"" he asked.
""Because that's when the priest comes,"" she replied.",1042,0.39420808097633725,0.17975103163622022,-0.8898097599602579,-1.044438707118373,-0.46969650623591436

The president wasn't due to be back until Monday; however, I knew that his secretary would be there and waiting for us today.
The office building was an hour's walk away. The walk gave me time to think about what had happened last night, but as always, I tried not to let myself go too deep into thought. My head couldn't handle the constant barrage of my own thoughts like it could when I was on Earth. It made me tired and depressed, so I tried to focus on the sights around me instead.
A red giant star shone in the sky, casting its light across Mars' northern hemisphere. I stared up at it as I walked past the skyscraper complexes that had been built in the northern cities when Mars was still habitable. Then more skyscrapers came into view as I approached the center of town. The buildings were made of glass, metal, stone, and brick, all of different colors and materials. They formed an intricate maze of structures surrounding a central plaza.
I turned towards the square, walking down one of the smaller roads that branched off from the main street. I passed several groups of people as I went. None of them were wearing protective suits, which indicated that they were from Mars' original settlers, or maybe one of its more recent colonies. There were plenty of signs of human life scattered throughout the city, despite it being a ruin now—there were a lot of ruins here on Mars.
Most of the buildings in the square were made of dark stone and had no glass windows on their facades, only some small holes where the glass used to be. The only thing that broke up the monotony of the square was the occasional sign or sculpture that dotted the ground. Some of them showed what looked like people—some male, some female. Most were dressed in clothes that looked like they'd come straight out of a history book from Earth, but some of them had clothing that I hadn't seen before.
I stopped when I reached the plaza in front of the white marble building that housed the Mars City Council office. A few members stood outside smoking cigarettes. I recognized the ones who were smoking as being from the mining team.
""Good morning, Alex,"" called one of the men. He was tall and thin, with black hair and dark eyes.
""Good morning, Kevin,"" I replied. ""What's the verdict?""
""Not yet, but we're hoping to get approval to start testing the new machines within the next two days."" His tone turned serious. ""There's also talk that they want the miners put back to work.""
""I'll tell the president then,"" I said. ""I'm sure he won't mind.""
Kevin smiled at me. ""You know him well, don't you?""
""Only by reputation,"" I said. ""I've only met the man once, but he seemed okay.""
""I wouldn't recommend getting too friendly with him though,"" he added. ""He has a reputation of being extremely controlling, even for a politician. You might find yourself caught up in his machinations if you get close to him.""
""No problem,"" I replied. ""I'm just here to give him the message anyway.""
I walked inside the building, heading up a set of stairs that led to the second floor. The offices were laid out in a similar fashion to the ones on Earth, with long, rectangular desks taking up a large portion of the space. I walked past the first four desk, trying to keep my footsteps quiet so that none of the secretaries noticed that I was there. After going two or three sets of desks, I found the president's office.
I opened the door and stepped inside. It was a nice looking office; the floors were made of dark wood, while the walls were painted with bright green stripes. The president himself sat behind his desk, talking on the phone. He was tall and broad with short grey hair. As soon as I saw him, I could see why his nickname was ""The Bull"". His face was scarred up, with a nasty looking burn scar running from his right eyebrow to his chin.
His secretary stood beside the president's chair. She was a young, dark haired woman with a slight build. I wondered how many women had fallen victim to him during his time in office.
""Good afternoon, Mr. President,"" I said.
""Ah, hello, Mr. Smith,"" said the president. ""I thought that I told you to call me John.""
I didn't respond, and instead walked over to the chair opposite his. John waved off the woman standing next to his desk and she walked away, presumably to get us drinks.
""So, is it true, Alex?"" asked John. ""Do you have a message for me from the president?""
""Yes, I do,"" I said. ""He wants to meet with us at his office this afternoon so that we can discuss our new proposals.""
""That's good news,"" said John. ""He must have approved them. I'll look forward to seeing what you two are working on.""
""I'll let you know when I leave,"" I told him, standing up.
""No, wait a moment,"" said John. ""Don't go yet. Sit back down.""
I turned to look at him. ""Why?""
John held up his hand, stopping me. ""Just sit back down, Alex.""
I nodded and sat back down, wondering what the old man had planned. When he was sure that I wasn't going anywhere, he lowered his phone and picked up a file folder from his desk. ""You've been through a lot recently,"" he started. ""I'm glad that you were able to reach the surface without any problems. However, I know that being on Mars hasn't been all easy either.""
His voice was soft as he spoke, but something about it felt wrong. I wasn't quite sure why, but I felt as if I shouldn't trust him.
""I believe that I know what happened to you back there,"" continued the president. ""I've known about you, Alex, since the day that you arrived on Mars. I've always wanted to meet you, but I've kept away for a very specific reason. I've watched you ever since you left my base. I've seen how you've grown, both physically and emotionally. I've seen you become what you are now. I knew that you'd be perfect for what I need you to do. I knew that you'd never accept the fate that was planned for you back then.""
I remained silent, unsure of what he was saying.
""But there was someone else who didn't want you to be the one to survive,"" said John. ""Someone who wanted things to end a certain way.""
""Are you talking about the aliens?"" I asked. ""Do you think that they were the cause of everything?""
John shook his head. ""They don't have anything to do with any of this, Alex. There's a more dangerous force at play than any alien race. And it has been in charge of your story since before you've even been born.""",1236,1.9014867395553074,0.8220733331338105,-0.9540235480190997,0.691484000227403,0.3870443902440311

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The president had been very busy since our arrival. He'd held press conferences every other day to talk about what was going on in the city, as well as what was being done to get things back up and running again. The Martian government had declared a state of emergency after the attack by the Chinese, which meant that all nonessential personnel were sent home and the military was called in to help clean up the mess. As a result, there weren't many people around. Most of the residents who hadn't evacuated had gone into hiding until things settled down. There wasn't much else they could do anyway.
My first stop was the café where I worked part time. My boss, Mr. Koshikawa, had left instructions for me to go straight there after leaving Dr. Sato's house. When I got inside, he was sitting behind the counter reading through a stack of papers while sipping some coffee. He looked up when I came in, smiled, and then gestured toward one of the tables.
""Sit down, Kenji,"" he said. ""You look like you're in a hurry.""
""Sorry, Mr. Koshikawa,"" I replied. ""I've got something important to take care of today.""
Mr. Koshikawa nodded and returned to his paperwork. I sat down at the table and opened the envelope. Inside was a note written by the president himself.
Dear Kenji,
Thank you for your hard work during the crisis. You are doing a great job in helping us rebuild the city and get everything back to normal. I want to thank you personally for your efforts. If you would please come see me this afternoon, I will be more than happy to reward you for them.
Yours truly,
President John F. Kennedy
I folded the note up and put it away before standing up to leave. Mr. Koshikawa gave me a smile and said, ""Have fun!""
It didn't take me long to walk to the president's office. Once I arrived, I went inside and handed over my ID card to the guard at the entrance. Then I walked past him and entered the main room. A man wearing a dark suit stood next to the president's desk. He was holding a tablet computer in front of him, but turned to face me when I approached.
""Kenji?"" asked the man. His name tag read ""John Smith"".
""Yes, sir,"" I said.
Smith glanced at the president and then motioned toward me. ""Please wait here for a moment. We'll let you know if the president is ready to see you.""
I nodded and waited for him to return. After a few minutes, he reappeared and told me to follow him. He led me into another room and pointed at a chair. I sat down and watched as he spoke with someone on the other side of the glass window. They were speaking English, so I couldn't understand most of what they were saying. Finally, the man nodded and left.
A minute later, President Kennedy came in. He was wearing a blue suit and tie, along with a white shirt. He looked just like any other American politician you might see on television.
""Hello, Kenji,"" he said. ""How are you?""
""Fine, sir,"" I replied. ""And yourself?""
Kennedy shook his head. ""Not good. Not good at all.""
We both fell silent for a moment. I didn't know how to respond to that, so I decided to change the subject.
""What can I do for you, sir?"" I asked.
""Well, I wanted to ask you to join my cabinet,"" said Kennedy. ""I need someone to lead the reconstruction effort.""
I blinked several times. ""Sir, I'm not sure that's possible,"" I replied. ""I don't think I have the experience or qualifications for that sort of position.""
""Don't worry about that, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""This isn't a political appointment. You won't be answering to anyone but myself. This is strictly volunteer work. All I want you to do is help me rebuild the city. That's it. Nothing more. Is that okay with you?""
I hesitated for a moment. I liked working for Mr. Koshikawa, and I didn't really want to give that up. But at the same time, I knew I had to accept the offer if I wanted to keep living here.
""Yes, sir,"" I finally replied. ""If you think I can help, then I guess I should do it.""
""Good,"" said Kennedy. ""Now, I'll tell you what I've been thinking about. First, I want to make sure everyone knows we're safe again. So, I've ordered the military to start patrolling the streets. They'll be keeping watch over the city 24/7. Second, we're going to have to rebuild the power grid. I'm sending a team of engineers to figure out how to do that. Third, I want to build new housing for the homeless. And lastly, I want to find ways to bring in money. I'm going to have to call a special session of congress to discuss the situation. Hopefully, they'll pass legislation to allow us to sell off some of the land. Once that happens, I plan to use the money to rebuild the city.""
""Sounds like a lot to deal with, sir,"" I said.
""That's why I'm asking for your help, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""I want you to be my point man for all of these projects. You can handle it, right?""
I thought about it for a second. I did feel confident in my ability to manage the reconstruction project, but I wasn't sure I was cut out for the rest of what he was talking about.
""I guess I can try,"" I said. ""But I still don't think I have enough experience for this kind of thing.""
""Don't worry about that,"" said Kennedy. ""I don't expect you to know everything. Just do the best you can. That's all I ask. Okay?""
I nodded. ""Okay, sir.""
""Great,"" said Kennedy. ""Then let's get started. Let's go talk to Mr. Koshikawa.""
He led me back into the main room, where I saw Mr. Koshikawa standing next to the door. The president introduced me to him, and then the three of us headed outside.
""So, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""What do you think? Can you handle the reconstruction project?""
""I don't know yet, sir,"" I replied. ""I haven't had a chance to study the details yet.""",1119,0.38799291489780036,-0.22162821053345716,0.4937064905978756,0.6162329423450865,0.2882126274575873

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. That meant only one thing. Winter would be coming soon. In fact, winter had already begun back on Earth; there would be snow on the ground by now if we were still there. Still, even though it wasn't as cold here, winter came every year just like it did down below.
It didn't take long until I arrived at the main building on site where we had been stationed for nearly eight months. We'd lived in an old military base that had originally been built to house soldiers during wartime. Now, however, it served mostly as an administration center. Inside, I found myself surrounded by people wearing uniforms—some of them wearing NASA ones, others belonging to various branches of the UN Space Force. All of us looked busy with our tasks, but there were always plenty of people standing around waiting for something or someone. As I approached the reception area, an older man with white hair noticed me approaching. He got up from his desk and walked towards me, extending his hand.
""Mr. Jones? The president himself asked us to give this to you personally."" His face broke out into a wide smile, revealing teeth stained yellow by cigarettes. ""The president would like to speak with you as soon as possible. Is three o'clock okay?""
I nodded before accepting the letter. ""Sure. Just let me grab my things and then we'll head over.""
He waved goodbye before returning to his chair behind the counter and resuming work. It took about fifteen minutes for me to collect all of my belongings and put everything away inside my bag. By the time I was ready, another man had appeared next to me. He was a bit younger than me, with a neatly trimmed beard and brown eyes that reminded me of the sea.
""You must be Mr. Jones?"" he said. I gave him a small nod and he extended his hand towards me. ""My name is Colonel Davenport. I'm a representative of the President of Earth and Mars. You may call me 'John.' May I ask what your connection with the president is?""
""We're both ex-astronauts,"" I answered immediately. ""He's actually the one who sent us to Mars to start with.""
He smiled. ""Ah, yes, I heard about you two being sent down here after the failure of Project Blue. Well, I'm glad to hear you've been doing so well.""
""Yeah, it's definitely turned out better than expected. Although, if they ever figure out how to send humans into space, we'll probably be back.""
""Well, I can say I don't envy you guys anymore."" He chuckled and I could tell he was trying to make light of the situation. I laughed along with him. We shook hands again before parting ways.
When we reached the presidential offices, I followed John down several halls lined with portraits of the previous presidents of Mars. They looked serious in their pictures, but the one we were heading towards was smiling widely and holding a big book in his arms. It was hard to tell exactly which president he represented because he looked young, and I couldn't quite see any distinguishing features that might have helped to identify him. When we finally reached the end of the corridor, he gestured towards a set of double doors made of steel plates and told me to go in first. I did so and found myself standing in front of an oval window, looking out onto the city of New York. There were people walking around everywhere, but not enough to fill the streets. A few cars drove by, but none of them stopped near the road to let anyone on or off. Instead, everyone just used the elevated rails to get wherever they needed to go.
""Hello again, Mr. Jones,"" said a familiar voice, startling me. ""It's nice to see you again after all this time. Please, come inside.""
A tall man in a white robe emerged from behind the glass window, waving to me as he spoke. I hadn't seen him since I left Earth almost ten years ago. Then again, I hadn't gone back to visit my parents either.
""How are you?"" I asked as he approached me.
""I'm fine, thank you,"" he responded. ""Please, come inside.""
Once I crossed the threshold, we sat down across a table covered by a blue cloth, each of us having our own seat. He handed me the letter he had given me earlier and I opened it to read. It said simply: ""I hope things are going well for you in your new home.""
""So far so good. I'm really enjoying it here.""
""That's great news,"" he replied. ""As I'm sure you know, this isn't always the case. We usually don't have anyone leave Earth and find a place here on Mars, although it happens more frequently than most people think. What do you mean when you say 'it happens more frequently than people think?'""
""Well, there was this one guy—""
""—who went missing after he left Earth,"" interrupted the president. ""Didn't you hear about it?""
""Not really,"" I admitted. ""I didn't really pay attention to the news.""
""Oh, right. I forgot you haven't been following it closely since you've been on Mars. Anyway, the reason we're having this meeting is that we'd like to invite you to return home. It's time for you to go back.""
I stared at him blankly for a moment before realizing he was serious. My mouth hung open and I felt my cheeks grow hot as I looked away from him. This could not be happening! After all these years, he wanted me to go home? ""Why?"" I managed to utter at last. ""What about you? Aren't you supposed to stay here until your term ends?""
""Yes, but that doesn't change anything for you, does it?"" he replied. ""If I want to return to Earth, it won't stop you from staying here, will it?""
I thought about it for a moment while I chewed on my lip. ""No… I suppose it wouldn't.""
""Then it looks like the decision is out of my hands."" He smiled. ""Although, I still don't know why you never told anyone where you were planning to go when you left Earth.""
I shrugged. ""You know how it goes. Things happen unexpectedly. Besides, there was nothing wrong with leaving Earth to live on Mars.""
""You're right about that, but we would have been much better prepared to deal with you if we knew where you were.""
""But you did anyway, didn't you?""
""I sent you messages telling you to contact us if you ever needed help."" He nodded. ""We should have done more to keep tabs on you when you were here too, but no one expected you to become an astronaut in the first place. We didn't even know that astronauts existed until you showed up, after all.""",1212,1.325638133179515,-0.7153815044088152,0.8584660159161328,1.0763072120693082,-0.9425152506806495
55,R_2flnX4qlI0EmkaY,BAS_HR_9,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He knew she wasn't local; no one from this town would be so brazen as to walk into a place like that—especially not with such an obvious limp. But still, he couldn't help but stare. The girl's hair was long and black, cut short enough to show off her pale skin and bright green eyes. Her lips were full and red, and she had a small mole on her right cheek that made him want to reach out and touch it. It seemed like she didn't notice him staring at all, though. Instead, she picked up a knife and began cutting fruit for herself.
He watched her eat, fascinated by how much she ate without even seeming to realize it. There was something about her that drew him in, and when he realized what it was, he wanted nothing more than to get closer. When she finished eating, she left without saying anything to anyone, and he found himself wanting to follow after her. But there was work to do, and he needed money if he was going to stay here. So instead, he went back to serving drinks.
A few days later, she came back again. This time, he was working behind the bar. As soon as she walked in, he could tell she hadn't changed. She still wore the same clothes, and she still carried that knife around with her. He wondered why she did it, then decided he didn't really care. All he cared about was getting close to her.
She looked around the room, then headed toward him. ""I'll have another ale,"" she said simply.
""Coming right up.""
When he brought it over to her, she smiled at him. ""Thank you,"" she said. Then she turned away, heading straight for the door.
Before he could say anything else, she was gone. And once again, he found himself wishing he'd followed after her.
But it wasn't until three weeks later that he finally got the chance.
He was working behind the bar when a group of men entered. They were obviously travelers, dressed in rough leathers and carrying packs on their backs. One of them glanced at him and nodded.
""You're new here,"" he said.
""Yes, I am.""
""What's your name?""
""Brennan.""
""Well, Brennan, I'm Ransom."" He held out his hand, and Brennan shook it.
Ransom pulled out a chair for his friend, who took it gratefully. ""So, what brings you to our little village? You don't look like farmers or merchants.""
""We're looking for someone,"" Brennan explained. ""A woman named Lila.""
""Lila? That's a pretty name. Where is she?""
""We think she might be staying at the inn,"" Ransom told him. ""Do you know if she's there?""
Brennan frowned. ""No. Why are you asking me?""
""Because we've been trying to find her for months now. We need to talk to her, but she won't answer us. Do you know her?""
""Not personally. But I heard she used to live in this area.""
""How far back does she go?""
""Back before my parents were born. But I don't remember any details. Maybe she's just a traveler passing through.""
""That doesn't sound very likely.""
""Why not?""
""If she lived here before, she must have known people. Wouldn't they have mentioned her to you?""
""Maybe. But maybe they didn't.""
""Or maybe she ran away from home.""
""It's possible.""
""Then you should ask around. If she has family here, they might be able to tell you where she lives now.""
""I will. Thank you for your help.""
As soon as the men left, Brennan returned to his work. But he couldn't stop thinking about Lila. What had happened to her? Who was she? How did she end up alone in this world?
He was so lost in thought that he didn't hear the door open, and when he turned around, he nearly fell over. Standing in front of him was a woman. She was tall and slender, with long dark hair and big brown eyes.
""Are you okay?"" she asked.
""Oh! Yes, yes, sorry. I was just…thinking.""
""About what?""
""Um…"" He cleared his throat. ""I guess I was wondering about you.""
She laughed, and it made him smile. ""Me?""
""Yeah, you."" He reached out and touched her arm lightly. ""You seem familiar to me somehow.""
Her face lit up. ""Really? Can you tell me where I know you from?""
""No, I can't. Not yet, anyway.""
""Oh. Well, that's too bad. I hope you figure it out sometime.""
""Me too.""
""Is that your drink?""
""Yes, thank you.""
""My name is Eliza. It's nice to meet you, Brennan.""
""Likewise.""
They talked for a while longer, and eventually, Brennan left. But he couldn't stop thinking about her.
The next day, he stopped by the tavern again. This time, he was hoping to see her. But when he arrived, he saw that she was gone.
""Where did she go?"" he asked the bartender.
""She left yesterday morning.""
""Did she say where she was going?""
""No, but she said she'd be back.""
""Have you seen her since?""
""Not that I know of.""
He sighed. ""Thanks.""
But he still couldn't stop thinking about her. So the next night, he came back. And the next.
And every night after that, he came back to see her. He never spoke to her, though. He just watched her from afar, smiling whenever he caught her looking at him.
After two weeks, he was starting to wonder if she ever would return. But then, one evening, she walked into the tavern.
""Hey, Bren,"" she said.
""Hi, Lila.""
""How have you been?""
""Good. Busy.""
""Busy doing what?""
""Working, mostly.""
""Here, let me buy you a drink.""
""Okay.""",982,-1.2942205673491505,-0.6852796624705925,0.1768116889147962,1.3094079669144332,-1.6094667414527875

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
It felt like a good omen. Maybe it would be another good day.
I walked over to the parking lot near the university and parked my car. The walk back up the hill was short.
When I entered the building, one of the guards stopped me. ""Excuse me,"" he said. ""You can't go down there."" He pointed at the elevator. ""I think you've got the wrong floor.""
I smiled. ""That's fine,"" I said. ""I'm actually going up."" I took out my ID card and flashed it at him. ""Dr. Jameson is expecting me. Do you want to tell him I didn't show?""
The guard blinked. ""Well... yeah. That's kinda what I'm supposed to do if you don't have an appointment."" He looked at the ID. ""Is this a student ID?""
""It looks like it."" I shrugged. ""Sorry.""
""I mean, I know we usually aren't supposed to let them in without appointments but... um... well..."" He looked uncomfortable. ""But I guess you're okay,"" he finally told me.
There was no elevator here, so instead I started up the stairway, thinking I'd get some exercise since I hadn't had time for a jog yet today.
Maybe I could use this as my chance to take the stairs. After all, I knew they were just a precautionary measure because of the elevators being taken out of commission in case someone tried to hijack one. I couldn't blame them for worrying about something like that, but it meant that when you needed to go up or down a whole floor, the stairs were your only option.
Not a bad problem to have, really.
At least for people like me.
By the time I reached the top floor, I was breathing hard from the climb. When I entered Dr. Jameson's office, he was sitting at his desk, writing something. I smiled at him and took the chair in front of his desk. He looked up as I came in.
""Good afternoon, Jim,"" I said. ""I trust your morning went well?""
He smiled. ""It did. You know I always enjoy our talks.""
I grinned at him and opened the envelope. ""I've got some good news to share with you. According to the data I received this morning, we might actually start seeing some real progress with these prototypes.""
Jim leaned forward eagerly. ""Really? When exactly will we see results?""
I smiled. ""Well, I'll give you the specifics later, but... you may want to start preparing for some good news.""
He frowned. ""Why should I have to prepare for something I've been waiting a long time to hear?""
""Because, Jim... the president wants us to go public with everything by the end of the week. He feels that if we announce all of this publicly, it will motivate the rest of the world to help us solve the problems we're facing with the new technologies. He wants to make sure that everyone knows about our success.""
""And we should be happy with that?"" he asked.
I nodded. ""Yes, sir."" I pulled out the letter from the president and handed it to him. Then I sat back in my chair and crossed my legs. ""I also ran into some other interesting news.""
Jim unfolded it carefully.
As soon as he finished reading it, his eyes lit up and he jumped out of his seat. ""What? That's great!"" he exclaimed. ""So you're going public with everything by the end of the week?""
I nodded. ""Right now I'm putting together a press conference for Friday and we're going to start showing off the new tech at that point. We're just waiting for the final approval for all of this to come through, but I know it's going to happen sooner rather than later. I think the president has already approved the final designs, so we're just waiting for him to go public with it. We'll probably see all of this announced in the news by the end of the week.""
Jim stared at me, dumbstruck. ""Are you kidding me? All right! This is amazing!"" he shouted, then he jumped out of his chair and pumped both fists in the air. ""We're going to blow the doors off the competition! We're going to be the ones everyone else copies, and we'll have more money than we know what to do with.""
I laughed. ""Now that's what I call a win-win situation.""
""Exactly,"" he said, smiling. ""This is going to be fantastic!""
I laughed. ""Yeah. It will.""
But there was still something bothering me about all of this.
If the president wanted to go public with what we were doing, why was it a problem for him that he couldn't tell his own wife about it? He'd spent the last two years trying to hide it from her and had done a pretty damn good job of it so far.
I knew she would be angry if he told her now. The way he'd been acting toward her lately wasn't any secret, but if he went public about what we were actually doing, I was sure it wouldn't look good. Not to mention, she was likely to want to stop this research because of how much they'd already spent on it.
I glanced down at the letter again.
""So, uh... what was that letter you were reading?"" Jim asked.
I shook my head. ""Just some paperwork. Nothing important.""
He rolled his eyes. ""Okay, so let's focus on your presentation this Friday. What do we need to get ready?""
I shrugged. ""All I need is the final approval to proceed.""
Jim grinned. ""Well, I hope that happens. I'll talk to you later.""
I nodded. ""Great. See you then."" I stood up and walked over to the door. ""Oh, by the way,"" I said. ""I got a little surprise for you.""
""A surprise?""
""Yep. I've been working on it for a while.""
Jim raised a curious eyebrow. ""What kind of surprise?""
I gave him a crooked grin. ""It starts with an 'F' and ends with an 'O'. And it rhymes with 'giant.'""
He laughed, then shook his head at me. ""You know, Jim, I never thought I'd find myself wanting to kill someone less than I want to kill that bastard Dr. Mok.""
I smiled. ""Well, keep in mind that we'll probably end up killing him eventually. So I hope you've made yourself comfortable because the ride is getting longer. We're going to need you to stick around a bit longer.""",1139,1.203055319538319,0.3829158032584876,0.9656742418846688,-0.6063847067818297,1.3705654644381995
57,R_1Q3f54i4m0QMCoQ,FAN_HOR_3,Horror,Fandango,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had my eyes and nose, but it was like nothing I'd ever seen before. The man's flesh had been stretched unnaturally thin across his face, and there was blood in his mouth. He didn't have any hair except for a little stubble on his chin. His body was as lean and bony as a bone. There wasn't an ounce of fat anywhere on him.
""What are you?"" he asked.
He spoke with a strange accent, like he was trying to imitate something he'd only heard once. It was a bit like how some people talk when they're drunk, but not quite. ""Who are you?"" I said.
""How can you see me if I'm in your reflection?"" he said.
""That's what reflections do,"" I said. ""They show us things we're already seeing.""
His eyes narrowed. ""Why did you let me through?"" He sounded angry.
""What do you mean? I didn't do anything. You just appeared in front of my mirror."" I turned around and sat down on the bed. ""You must be hungry,"" I said. ""Let me get you something to eat.""
He stepped closer, taking another step into my room. ""What do you mean, 'let me through?'""
He was close enough that I could smell the scent of his breath—a terrible stench—and see the tears streaming down his pale face. ""It doesn't matter,"" I said. ""I'll make you something to eat.""
I started rummaging through my cabinets, looking for something quick to make. I found a box of ramen noodles and grabbed the carton. I took it back to my bed and put everything on the floor so he could reach them. Then I lay back down, closed my eyes, and pretended to sleep.
The man watched me with those empty eyes of his. As soon as he saw I was asleep, he rushed toward the bed. He didn't hesitate to take a knife to me. My eyes flew open, and I pulled my phone out to record him. I had no idea how much time we had, but I couldn't risk letting him get away.
My phone didn't have any signal. He stabbed me in the stomach, cutting straight through my organs. He held onto my phone with one hand while sticking the blade of the knife into my chest. I stared into his eyes the whole time, hoping to make contact. After a few seconds, I managed to squeeze out a few words.
""Don't hurt me,"" I said. ""I want you to stay here.""
He hesitated. Then he dropped my phone. He grabbed my shoulders, pushed me back, and ripped my shirt. Blood poured everywhere. When he saw the wound, he started laughing.
I grabbed the knife and jammed it into his chest. He let go and collapsed to the ground. I rolled off the bed and sat on the floor next to him. I pressed my hands against the bleeding wound, trying to stop the flow, but there was too much. The man died right in front of me.
My phone suddenly began ringing. A call from my dad was coming through.
""What the hell is going on?"" he said.
""I'm fine,"" I said. ""But the house...it's full of demons.""
""I don't care about the house!"" he yelled. ""Your mom and sister are missing! We need to find them.""
""Calm down,"" I said. ""The guy who attacked me is dead. There's no reason to worry about him anymore.""
He didn't believe me, though. He kept yelling at me.
""I'm on my way home. You stay where you are.""
My phone went silent, and all I could hear was my dad getting closer.
""Who was that?"" asked the stranger.
""My father. He's on his way.""
""Why would he be worried about a demon?""
""It has something to do with the house,"" I said. ""He thinks I've seen one, so he wants me to stay here until he gets here. I'm not sure why he's coming back, though.""
The man was still sitting up, holding his chest. It was obvious that he wasn't alive anymore. His skin was completely blue, and his eyes were open, but I couldn't see anything inside them.
""I have to go,"" I said. ""Wait here until my father gets here. You should keep a lookout, though, just in case there are more demons.""
I stood and backed away from him. I opened the door, went into the hallway, and shut it behind me. A few moments later, I heard the sound of the front door slamming.
I checked the front door and was relieved to see it was still locked. I was afraid my dad might leave it open when he got back. I headed upstairs. Before I made it to my room, however, I passed by the stairs, and the door was open. Something moved in the shadows, and the hairs on my arms stood up. I stopped, wondering if I was imagining things. Then I remembered what happened the last time I saw a shadow move.
When I reached the top of the stairs, I walked down the hall until I came to my brother's room. The light was on, and I could hear the sounds of music playing. I peeked in and saw him lying in his bed. He had been watching a movie on his laptop when I left, but now he was fast asleep. He must've fallen asleep while I was downstairs talking to my dad.
I pulled my phone out and turned it on. While I waited for it to power up, I took in the details of the room.
Everything seemed normal until I looked at his desk. All of the drawers were open. There wasn't any sign of him or my mother. I knew I hadn't imagined what I saw earlier, so this must have happened while I was in the basement.
I went to the door and listened outside. Nothing was wrong. I heard the sounds of footsteps, so I figured my father had arrived. I opened the door and stepped outside.
My dad had parked next to the house. I could see his taillights through the trees. He was arguing with someone. The person looked like someone I didn't recognize, probably because he wasn't wearing a shirt.
""Where are my children?"" my dad shouted. ""You better start talking, or you won't like what happens next!""
The person's response was unintelligible, but the tone of their voice told me he wasn't kidding.",1127,-0.17379208129886353,0.07474864344959765,1.196449960426048,0.14989752763496395,0.4054438890101882
58,R_2e5y8U0RchGRCNT,ACE_HR_5,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He could feel his cheeks redden with embarrassment as he tried to hide himself behind a newspaper, but she had seen him, and she looked directly at him with an expression that said she knew exactly who he was. It was almost more than he could bear, having someone else know what he was doing, and so he rose from his chair and walked away without saying anything. But he couldn't help looking back over his shoulder to see if she would follow him. And she did.
He never went near the bar again after that day—he couldn't bear it if he ran into her there. The only way he could be sure not to run into her was by going home every night early and staying up late reading books on history, which wasn't all that exciting for him anyway. So when she came into the shop he owned, he hid behind a bookcase, pretending to read. When she left, he pretended he didn't know who she was, even though everyone in the town knew. That made things easier, since no one would bother him then.
It's funny how you can get used to something, especially when it's the thing you want most. After a while, seeing her around the town became normal enough that he stopped thinking about her as much. Until one evening when he was walking home through the woods and he heard her voice calling out to him from somewhere nearby. ""William!"" she cried out.
He turned to look at her and found her standing just beyond the trees, smiling at him. He smiled back, relieved to find her alive. But when she reached out to touch his cheek, he felt something sharp beneath her fingertips. He flinched involuntarily, pulling away from her touch, but she took hold of his hand instead and pulled him closer until their bodies were pressed together. He could feel her warmth against his own and wondered if this meant they were friends now. Then she kissed him, hard, and he realized they weren't. They weren't anything except strangers who happened to live in the same place.
""I have to go,"" she told him. ""But I'll see you tomorrow.""
And she disappeared before he could ask her why.
That was two weeks ago, and he hadn't seen her since then. Every day, he would walk down to the river and look for her, but each time she was nowhere to be found. Sometimes, he thought he caught a glimpse of her reflection in the water, but always when he moved towards it, she disappeared. He kept hoping she might show up, or that maybe she had gone somewhere else. But today he decided he wouldn't wait anymore. Today he was going to talk to her.
As William stepped onto the path that led to the river, he felt a chill fall over him. He shivered and glanced around, trying to figure out what was wrong, but the sun shone brightly overhead and there wasn't any wind blowing. Wasn't there? Something was different...
Ahead, he saw her sitting on the ground beside the river, staring into the water, her head bent low, as if she were listening to the sound of its flow. For some reason, she seemed to be crying. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking on his part. He couldn't tell whether she was male or female, although he suspected she must be female because he knew he was a man. Maybe he was mistaken about that too, since he couldn't really see very well. All he could make out was a dark outline, like a shadow. He stood still, watching her, wondering what she was doing there and why she was crying. As he watched her, he began to wonder if perhaps he should leave.
Maybe he shouldn't have come here after all. If she wanted to be alone, maybe he should let her be alone. But he was curious, so he started toward her, intending to say hello. He didn't intend to startle her, but he certainly hoped she didn't mind that he was approaching. Perhaps she'd be glad to see someone else.
When he got close enough, he saw that she had her hands buried deep inside the pocket of her skirt. Her head was bowed, and her shoulders shook slightly as she sobbed quietly to herself.
He frowned, feeling sorry for her. He wondered if he should call out to her, or maybe offer to give her a hug, but she looked so sad, so lost, he hesitated to do either of those things. Instead, he sat down next to her, resting his arm along the back of her seat. His hand closed around hers, and she jerked away, turning her face away.
She sniffed loudly and wiped her eyes with her sleeve, smearing mud across her cheeks. When she spoke, her words were muffled by her lips, making them sound like slurred whispers. ""What are you doing?""
He frowned, puzzled. What was he supposed to do? ""Doing what?"" he asked. ""Why did you cry?""
Her reply surprised him. ""You don't understand."" She sounded angry, hurt, bitter. ""My mother died last week.""
His heart went out to her. How terrible! ""Oh,"" he said softly. ""How did she die?""
""The plague,"" she replied. ""They think she probably picked it up from the rats that infest the sewers under the city. It's spreading fast, and there's nothing we can do to stop it.""
He nodded sympathetically. ""Yes, that does seem bad.""
She looked up at him, and for a moment he thought he saw something familiar in her eyes, like recognition, but then she turned away and stared off into the distance once more.
""Did you ever lose someone?"" he asked. ""Someone you loved?""
She didn't answer right away, but after a few moments she said, ""No. No one I've ever loved has died.""
He wished he knew what to say, how to comfort her, but he didn't. There was nothing he could possibly say that would ease her pain, and so he simply waited for her to finish. When she finally did, he tried to put himself in her shoes and imagine what he would feel like if he were in her situation. He thought about how he would feel if he'd been the one who had lost someone. He imagined that he would be devastated, that he would want to scream and shout and rage against the unfairness of it all. And that's exactly what she did.
She screamed and shouted and ranted and raved, and William tried to calm her, to reassure her, to explain that there was nothing anyone could do. But he knew he was only saying the same thing over again, and that it didn't matter, not to her. Not to anyone. And he knew that he couldn't help her, that there was no way for him to ease her suffering, even though he wished desperately that there was.
Finally, she fell silent and lay back against the ground. She pulled her knees up against her chest and wrapped her arms around them. ""It doesn't matter,"" she murmured, as if talking to herself. ""I'm not important. I never was.""
""Who said that?"" he asked gently.
""I did.""
He shook his head in disbelief. ""Why would you say such a thing?""",1266,0.5974157938619271,-1.1147970363844748,-1.0255336509174464,-0.3687158853831388,1.4299391200135416
59,R_2tLmSNoPEl4Zuu1,LOW_HF_8,High Fantasy,Low Rider,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Well,"" said Kjorn as he led them through the gates that had appeared suddenly in front of them, ""I'm not sure I would call this place an oasis."" He looked around with a critical eye and sighed heavily. ""It's not exactly what you'd expect to see after crossing the river.""
Kol stared out at the expanse of water, which stretched off before him into the distance, and shook his head. ""We have to cross?""
""Yes, Kol. We've been walking since dawn. And I don't think you're going anywhere if you keep moping about like that."" She gave his arm a light shove. ""Now come on, we're here now.""
His face brightened slightly at her tone, though he still looked skeptical. Then he nodded and fell in behind her as she led them across the stone bridge into the village. They came upon a narrow lane winding between buildings. As they walked, several people emerged from their houses and shops. A woman carrying vegetables paused in her work as she watched the strangers enter her town. A man leaned against the post outside his shop, arms crossed over his chest, and watched as the travelers passed. Several children ran from one street corner to another chasing each other, laughing and shouting playfully, oblivious to the strangers. At first the villagers were silent, watching the travelers' progress with guarded interest. But soon curiosity got the better of them, and several more approached Kjorn and the others to ask who they were, where they had come from, how long they planned to stay—or, rather, how much money they hoped to spend while in the town.
Kjorn answered each question politely enough, but he did not linger. Instead, he led them toward the center of the village where there stood an inn at one end and the church at the other, both looking abandoned. The inn was shuttered tight and no sign remained of the people who had once lived there, although Kol saw signs of recent habitation: a half-eaten loaf of bread still sitting on a table, a bowl of soup left to cool on a countertop, pots stacked next to a fireplace, and clothing draped over chairs or hung from hooks. There were also a few small fires burning in hearths.
""That will do for us,"" he said, nodding toward the inn. ""At least for the time being."" He stepped forward, reaching toward the door latch, when Kjorn reached out to stop him.
""Wait.""
Kol held up his hand to halt Kjorn's advance. ""What is it?""
""There's something strange about that inn.""
He turned to look again at the structure and shivered despite the warmth of the morning. Kol had seen plenty of strange things in his life, most recently a giant snake that had swallowed a man whole, but even by those standards this inn seemed wrong somehow, as though it belonged to a different world entirely. Kol thought about telling Kjorn about the ghostly image that had appeared in the window just moments ago, but he didn't want to ruin his mood.
Instead he pointed his finger at the building and shouted, ""Away!""
The inn exploded outward, leaving nothing behind but a cloud of dust, the faint smell of smoke, and a large hole in the wall of the inn. The roof was gone. All the furnishings were scattered across the ground, along with bits of stone and mortar. The floorboards had vanished. Only piles of dirt and splintered wood remained. In their place was a patch of grass and a small grove of trees nearby, along with the ruins of a building made of gray stone.
Kol blinked several times before his eyes could adjust to the brightness of the sunlight, and he looked around for Kjorn. His friend was nowhere to be found.
Kol turned back to the inn. ""Kjorn?"" He looked around, trying to find someone else who might know where he had gone. No one was paying any attention to him so he began walking toward the spot where the inn had once stood, hoping to catch sight of Kjorn or one of the other companions.
As he walked down the alleyway between two buildings, a young woman stepped out of the shadows. She was dressed like a priestess and wore a white veil over her face, which was framed by shoulder-length dark hair. Her skin was pale and smooth; she carried a staff similar to the one Kjorn used.
""Are you looking for someone?"" she asked him in a calm voice.
Kol stopped. ""What do you mean?""
She smiled at him and raised her arms to stretch, though whether she meant to or not she nearly knocked him down. ""My name is Eryn. My friends call me Nysa."" She glanced at the sky, where birds flew in a lazy circle. ""It looks as if it is going to rain. You should hurry if you are hoping to find your friend.""
Kol started to tell her that he wasn't looking for anyone but then reconsidered and told her, ""I was looking for my companion. He said I should speak with you.""
Her smile faltered briefly before returning. ""Then you have come to the right place. Come with me, and I shall show you."" She turned away and walked quickly up the path between the buildings. Kol hesitated a moment longer but then hurried after her, following her up the hill to a large stone house on top of a rise overlooking the rest of the village and lake beyond.
""Welcome to our humble home,"" said Nysa. ""Do come inside."" She opened the door without waiting for an answer and gestured him through ahead of her. Once inside she closed and locked the door behind them and led him into a room lit only by a single lamp sitting atop a wooden table near the back of the room. A fire crackled in the hearth and the room felt warm after walking outside in the heat of the day. She went to one corner of the room where a large wardrobe stood open, and from within she pulled out a long robe with hooded sleeves and placed it carefully on a bed. She folded her hands behind her back as she stood there waiting for Kol to join her. ""Now, let us sit down and talk.""
Kol sat beside her on a long bench that faced one wall of the room. The air was thick with incense and the faint scent of herbs that lingered in the corners of the room. A number of books lay strewn across the floor, and he noticed a number of jars and bowls containing plants and flowers. One had to be a vial of poison as Nysa picked it up and sniffed its contents before putting it down again with a grimace.
""You are looking for your friend, yes?"" She waited for a response but none came. ""Yes? No? Or are you simply curious?""
Kol was unsure how to respond, so he chose the latter. ""Curiosity is sometimes more important than information.""
""So it is said."" With that, she sat quietly and looked straight at him. After a few moments she said, ""Tell me, what was it that drew you to our village?""",1286,-0.7576363158493623,-0.9730297597991444,0.7702845179132042,1.5056021083369482,-1.5696059844083552
60,R_2dgYWk5iFAobluP,ALL_HF_1,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It is good,"" said Joron. ""This is where I will build my first ship.""
""We cannot stay long,"" said the captain. ""Not with so many ships at sea."" He glanced back at them. ""Are you ready?""
The crew nodded, and he turned to lead them down the slope of the hill toward the village. As they descended, the village became more defined. The smoke was thicker, and there were more birds and animals running around. The houses were larger and sturdier than those on the islands, though no one was home. No one was at their work, either, as far as Joron could see. He looked at the two towers again, wondering if he should have left a man there to keep an eye on the village while the rest of him went off to find his new ship. Then again, that was why they had been given such large numbers of men and women – so they could look after themselves.
He followed the captain into the village, and a few of the crew glanced back at the ships and made their way to them, taking up stations around the hulls. Joron felt the weight of responsibility settle on his shoulders as he walked between the houses, feeling their stares on him. The silence was almost tangible, as if the place held its breath in anticipation of what would come next.
They reached the lake and crossed to the shore. There were no boats tied up here. Joron glanced up at the tower nearest them. A small door stood open and he heard voices from inside.
""There is something strange about this place,"" said the captain. ""It feels…"" He looked at Joron.
""Like it wants something,"" said Joron.
""Aye. Something, and I do not like it. I don't want us to be here for too long. We need to find this ship before nightfall.""
""And if we cannot?"" asked Joron.
The captain shrugged. ""Then we will spend the night here. But I am not looking forward to it. This place gives me a bad feeling."" He glanced down at Joron, his expression serious. ""We must be careful.""
""Of what?"" asked Joron, but the captain did not answer. He turned and walked toward the tower and Joron fell in behind him. The captain rapped on the door, and the voices inside stopped talking. The captain spoke. ""Come. It is the captain of the fleet.""
The door opened, and the captain stepped in, followed by Joron. They both paused, taking in the sight before them. There were five men inside. Three sat around a table, eating bread and drinking wine. The other two were standing by the fire, and one was staring out into the valley while the other moved through a room that looked like an armory. A man stood by a door on the far side of the room. He was young, his hair cropped short, and he wore a heavy leather coat with a wide belt. He nodded to them as they entered.
""Captain,"" he said, then turned his attention back to the men at the table. ""You are early.""
""I am not a man who likes to waste time,"" said the captain, ""especially when there is work to be done.""
""Yes, well, we are still getting things ready."" One of the men at the table put his bread down.
""That will do for now,"" said the captain. ""If you would, take some wine from the table over there. It has been brought from the ships.""
Joron glanced at the captain, wondering if this was some test or a trick, but the captain nodded to him. So he picked up a cup and went to join the man standing by the fire. The man smiled and took the cup from him and poured it full of wine.
""This is good,"" said Joron. ""I have never seen wine like this before.""
The man nodded and smiled. ""It is called Tethys' Blood. It comes from here."" He pointed to the valley below. ""But you may not see much of it if your captain does not hurry.""
""I am hurrying,"" said the captain. ""We all are. Now, where is this ship you wish me to look at?""
""There."" The man pointed toward the door opposite the one they had entered. ""It's a small building in the forest near the lake. You'll need torches, I'm afraid.""
""Then bring them.""
The man left and Joron followed the captain out into the hall, taking a seat on a bench beside him. He felt eyes upon him as he sat down. They were curious, and he felt that it was more than just the men who lived here. There was something watching them, too, and he knew he should not look around to find out what it was, but curiosity got the better of him. He glanced past the captain to the two men in the room with the weapons. One was a big man, tall and broad, his arms and chest bulging out under the leather of his coat. He had a large axe in one hand and a sword in the other. The other man was younger, leaner, almost gaunt, with long black hair falling to his shoulders. His hands were covered in tattoos. Joron did not know what they meant, but there seemed to be a story to them.
The man was staring at him, his eyes narrowed and his lips pressed tight. It was not anger or hatred, but a stare that spoke of a cold calculation, one that told Joron he could die at any moment.
Joron turned back to the captain and took a sip of wine. He felt the warmth in his chest and smiled. ""Is this ship really so important?"" he asked.
""It is,"" said the captain, ""and we do not have time to waste.""
""We are only a few days away from our destination. Surely we can stay another day or two?""
""No."" The captain stood up. ""We need to be off soon. We cannot be seen to be hanging about."" He glanced over to the two men in the room with the weapons. ""You will come with us."" He pointed toward the door. ""The rest of you remain here.""
The big man nodded. ""As you say, Captain.""
The smaller man shook his head. ""I am not coming.""
""What? You cannot leave me alone in this place.""
The man laughed. ""I am not leaving you alone. I'm staying with my brother."" He walked over to where the big man stood beside the fire. They shared a long look and then both laughed, and Joron found himself smiling along with them.
""I hope you have more than wine in your stores,"" said the big man.
""There's plenty, don't worry.""",1206,1.1297065179040169,-0.4884853729623726,1.054465258149165,-0.7199536599935664,-1.5125787949922522
61,R_3p4kUx4wCv7J7we,LOW_HF_1,High Fantasy,Low Rider,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. The three travelers were exhausted after so much travel, and the heat of midday made them even more weary. As they stood there gazing out over the valley, a man suddenly came running from one of the buildings at the top of the hill. He was dressed as though he lived in this place but had not been outside recently. His shirt and trousers were dirty and his arms were smudged with soot.
""What do you want?"" he gasped, panting for breath as he ran. ""Who are you? What's going on here?""
His hair was thin, gray and matted and hung about him like cobwebs. His skin was pale except for several dark streaks on his forehead and cheeks where sweat had collected. When he saw who the visitors were, he stopped short in astonishment.
""Is that...?"" He shook his head incredulously. ""That isn't possible!"" Then he began to cry in despair. ""Oh, I don't believe it! Is it really true? Is she truly alive and well? Are you actually bringing her back to me?""
Joron nodded, trying hard to smile. ""It is indeed, Lord Dath."" He stepped forward and clasped his friend's hand, which surprised him no end. The lord took his hand firmly. Joron found himself wondering what Dath would have said if he'd seen this moment a few weeks earlier, back in his ship. Would he be pleased or disappointed? Proud or jealous? And then he realised how stupid that was, because Dath wasn't here now; it was just a boy in dirty clothes who couldn't possibly know what had happened to Joron's ship or to Dath himself. Still, even though the boy's grip was rough, strong and sure, it was different than any other handshake or embrace Joron had ever received. He didn't know why, but he liked it.
Dath's eyes widened with shock when he saw the scar on the front of his captain's jacket. He dropped his arm and looked at Joron in dismay before turning and stumbling back down the hill. After a moment, he turned back.
""I'll go see her first,"" he called over his shoulder. ""Come inside with me. You can wash your hands and face. We'll find you some clean clothing while you tell me everything.""
Joron smiled again. ""Thank you, Lord Dath. Thank you for taking such good care of her.""
""Of course, Captain. I would never let anything happen to Lady Dyrn. She's my sister, after all.""
He went inside to wash himself, and Joron waited with his crewmates, who were all staring at him as though he was mad to allow an entire man to walk away from them without making any attempt to stop him.
""He saved your life once,"" said Cwell.
""Aye,"" Joron agreed, ""but that's not enough to make him a leader of men.""
Cwell snorted. ""If we could all save someone's life every time, there would be no need for leaders. Or captains.""
Joron thought for a minute, then shrugged. ""No doubt you're right."" He looked around. ""So, what will ye all do? Will ye wait here until Lord Dath comes back?""
""We'll wait,"" said Dyliss.
""But if he doesn't come back..."" Cwell said slowly.
""Then we'll stay here,"" replied Joron, looking over at her. ""As long as the sun shines on our backs, and as long as we have each other. But we won't stay here for long.""
They stayed in the house that Lord Dath showed them to and ate their meals at the table set aside for them. They told themselves that they would wait until evening to start out again, but after only one day of waiting, Joron couldn't take it anymore and sent Dyliss off to explore the village alone, while he sent Cwell and Hulver to the woods nearby to gather fruit for breakfast and lunch. Joron kept thinking about Dath's words, and wondered if they were true, or a lie told to him in order to convince him to help the boy.
Lord Dath came back early that afternoon carrying an armful of wildflowers he'd found growing on the hillside behind the inn. He carried them awkwardly, but still managed to walk with the poise and grace of one born to it. Even Joron felt inferior.
""My lady is sleeping,"" he said, setting the flowers on the table before Joron. ""She's resting and being tended to by a few of my people. You'll meet them when you come in."" He paused. ""You look tired, Captain. Come and sit. Eat some of these.""
Joron shook his head. ""I don't know if I should be eating, Lord Dath. The food we've eaten in the past few days has left us weak and sickly.""
""Don't worry about it. There's plenty here. Take a load off and rest. Rest is what you need.""
""I'm sorry, Lord Dath, but I am not yet fit enough to fight for you. If you wish to bring war to this land, then you will have to fight without me.""
Lord Dath smiled at him. ""There's no need to fight, Captain. I'm not here to invade or conquer anyone.""
""Then what brings you here, Lord Dath?"" asked Joron, sitting down and taking a deep breath. It felt like he hadn't done that in years. The air was fresh, cold and crisp, filling his lungs with a sense of relief and peace.
""To help,"" answered the lord. ""And perhaps, one day, to rule.""
He sat next to Joron, who looked him in the eye and smiled, though he had to admit that he didn't understand the meaning of those words, nor how they related to him.
""How long ago did they come, Lord Dath?"" asked Joron, looking at the flowers.
""Three years since you left, Captain,"" Lord Dath replied. ""Or five years if you consider how long we had before you arrived. It feels like it was yesterday, though.""
""I'm sorry I didn't stay to fight alongside you. I had to leave.""
""Ah, Captain,"" said Dath, smiling sadly, ""you wouldn't have fought with me, and that's fine. That wasn't my goal anyway.""
""What then?""
""To make myself the ruler of this land and to keep it safe. My brother was killed in battle against another lord of the same clan as yours.",1120,-0.8364189778997766,0.9019487460263809,1.2455682258048841,1.6860400404022982,-0.5775621364152754
62,R_1LCjgQJn4v5Fm9q,LOW_HF_4,High Fantasy,Low Rider,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""We'll have to camp here until morning,"" Dorn said after he had walked around the town once to check for signs that anyone lived there. ""I don't want us walking into something we can't handle.""
Aranthur nodded. There was nothing to see except buildings made mostly of wood and mud-brick walls that were crumbling, and there was no sign of people living there. He felt very nervous as he followed Dorn back to the river bank and started packing down their blankets and bedrolls. The others did not seem surprised by anything that happened. They just took everything as it came—and then they settled down to sleep in a circle around the fire that they had made earlier.
Aranthur lay awake watching the shadows dance across the clearing as the flames flickered. The night was warm and dry, but it seemed cold after so long under the sun, which was already sinking towards the western horizon. His head hurt too. He could not help wondering why they had come here; he would never have chosen this place for himself even if it meant saving his life. He wondered what it was that he had missed, what had gone wrong, what he should have done.
Then he slept.
Aranthur woke to the sound of voices. He opened his eyes slowly and looked at the faces hovering above him. The fire was dying down, but he could still make out the faces. It was early evening and there was mist rising off the lake and curling into the trees like smoke, obscuring the view.
Dorn sat on one side of him while Yalain and Aranthur's brother stood on the other side.
""What is going on?"" Aranthur asked, yawning. ""Why are you all looking at me?""
Yalain and her son exchanged glances. ""It was your idea to come here,"" Yalain said. She sounded very tired.
""So I hear. You're welcome to tell me now.""
""There's something in the water,"" Dorn said. ""Something in the air, maybe.""
He pointed towards the lake, where there was a little boat tied up at the dock. The mists had gathered more thickly around it and a breeze had blown up, blowing it across the surface. The boat was covered with dust and cobwebs and was leaking from the seams.
Dorn got up and went to inspect the boat carefully. He pushed his hands into the holes where the oars used to be, checking inside the cabin area, poking his fingers deep into every hole he could find, until he had satisfied himself that the thing was seaworthy enough to be moved to deeper waters. He climbed into the bow and started paddling, pushing the vessel across the calm lake, where it floated without moving against the current. After some time, he turned the boat towards the shore and pulled it to a stop next to the dock. Then he climbed out again and helped Yalain and Aranthur climb aboard.
""Where are we going?"" Aranthur asked as he clambered over the gunwale and into the stern cabin.
""We don't know,"" Yalain answered him quietly. ""But I think we need to get into the water and look around.""
She sat down and put her feet on the floorboards below and leaned forward on her arms so she could stare into the water.
""This is strange,"" she muttered. Her eyes narrowed as she studied it intently.
Aranthur watched her for a while, but he could see nothing except for the ripples caused by their movement across the surface.
""I'm not sure this is a good idea,"" Aranthur said finally. ""I don't understand how it works, but it seems to me that this might be an evil place.""
Aranthur could not say exactly what was wrong with this place; it looked so peaceful, sitting in the misty dusk. But somehow it felt wrong to him, as if something bad lurked behind the mist and in the water, waiting to pounce on them.
""That's ridiculous,"" Yalain answered him.
""What do you mean?"" Aranthur said defensively. ""What makes you say that? What's going on here?""
""Nothing is going on, and if you ask me, we're being stupid.""
""How can you know that?""
She sighed heavily. ""Look at the boats,"" she said. ""All these tiny ones, like toys, floating on the surface of a great ocean. And this whole lake is like a mirror; whatever I am looking at, I am seeing reflected right back at me.""
""Well, I can't see anything but the lake, Yalain. I think maybe you should be more careful about making accusations that might turn out to be unfounded.""
""I don't accuse, I just say what I see."" She shrugged. ""And that's all I see."" She looked at Aranthur and smiled sadly. ""If you want to argue any more, just go ahead—but I warn you, I won't change my mind.""
""I wasn't arguing,"" Aranthur said, irritated. ""I just thought that we shouldn't be wandering around in places like this.""
""Like where?"" Yalain stared at him, her eyes narrowing. Then she laughed suddenly, a low laugh that sounded almost girlish, and she shook her head.
""Oh yes, Aranthur, you are a city boy, aren't you? Well, I have been away for quite some time, but I've seen cities too. And I promise you that if this place doesn't feel like the most peaceful spot in the world, then there's nothing that does.""
""Maybe so,"" Aranthur replied. ""But you should be cautious.""
""Yes, I guess I should."" She frowned slightly at him, and he realized that he must appear as nervous as he felt. ""Anyway, Dorn says there is something in the water.""
Aranthur glanced sideways at his brother. Dorn was standing by the bow, staring intently into the darkening lake.
""What sort of something?"" Aranthur asked.
""I don't know yet.""
""Are you planning to drink it?"" Yalain asked incredulously.
""I don't plan to do anything at all,"" Dorn replied evenly. He did not answer Yalain's question. Instead he reached into his belt pouch and took out a large glass bottle, stoppered tightly with a cork. When he twisted the stopper loose, a thin stream of water poured into the bottle, then stopped as abruptly as it started.
""You want to drink this?"" Aranthur asked, horrified.
Dorn took the stopper out again and handed the bottle to Yalain, who nodded and took a long swallow from the neck.",1141,1.0370702007568282,1.0810378795010605,-1.3817209468790195,1.4503718393670133,0.7402876794661796
63,R_2s4Pq8aTVX2LZZX,BAS_HOR_3,Horror,Basic Coherence,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my reflection; it was someone else's. The person had black hair that was cut short in an almost military style, and their skin was pale like mine but with a darker tone. They wore a white dress shirt and dark pants.
""Who are you?"" I asked them as they stared back at me through the mirror. ""What do you want?""
The figure didn't say anything. Instead, he just continued staring at me for what seemed like hours before finally turning away. He then began walking towards the door. I followed him and watched as he opened it. There were two other figures standing outside. One was tall and thin while the other was shorter and rounder. Both of them had long hair and wore similar clothes to the one who'd been inside the mirror.
""You're not supposed to be here,"" said the man with the black hair. His voice sounded familiar somehow.
""We know,"" answered the woman with the longer hair. She spoke with a heavy accent. ""That is why we came.""
""Why would you do that? You shouldn't have done this. We could've found another way.""
""It was our only option,"" replied the taller woman.
""Well, now we don't have any options left. What will we do now?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""We'll find a way to get rid of them,"" said the woman with the heavier accent.
""How?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""By killing them,"" she told him. ""Kill them all so no one can tell us apart.""
""But how?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""We'll figure something out,"" said the woman with the heavier accent. ""Just make sure you kill them all. That's the only way we can stay alive.""
""Yes, ma'am,"" said the man with the black hair.
He closed the door behind him and left. As soon as the door shut, I ran to the window and saw him walk down the stairs and head out of sight. Then I turned around and looked at the mirror. I knew I couldn't let them escape. If they did, then they'd go after everyone else. I had to stop them before they could hurt anyone else.
I grabbed my knife from my nightstand and headed back to the mirror. This time when I entered, I didn't see anything except darkness. I reached out with my hand and felt nothing. I tried to turn on the light switch next to the mirror but it wouldn't work. I was trapped in the mirror with nowhere to run.
I started to panic but then I remembered the power button on my phone. I pulled it out of my pocket and pressed it. The screen lit up and I quickly typed in the number for 911. A few seconds later, I heard sirens outside. I waited until the police arrived and then stepped out of the mirror.
When the police officers entered the room, they immediately noticed the broken mirror and the blood splattered across the wall. They also saw the bodies lying on the floor. After taking pictures of everything, they took me to a cell where I stayed for three days. During that time, I was questioned by several detectives but none of them ever figured out who I really was or what happened.
After those three days, I was released without being charged with anything. My parents were relieved to see me home safe. However, I still had no idea who I was or how I got there. I decided to return to school because I needed to figure things out.
As I walked to my locker, I bumped into someone. I looked up and saw the girl from the mirror. Her face was covered by her hands. When she removed them, I realized it was her.
""Hi,"" she said.
""Hello,"" I replied.
She smiled and held out her hand. ""My name is Marie.""
""Nice to meet you, Marie,"" I said as I shook her hand. ""I'm Jason.""
""So, you're the one who broke the mirror,"" she said.
""Yeah,"" I responded.
""And you killed the people who were trying to take me away,"" she added.
""Yes, I did,"" I told her.
""Thank you,"" she said. ""You saved my life.""
""No problem,"" I replied.
Marie then looked down at her feet and said, ""I need your help.""
""With what?"" I asked.
""To save the world,"" she explained.
""Save the world?"" I repeated.
""Yes, Jason,"" she said. ""This is the last time I'm going to ask you. Please help me.""
""Okay, I'll try,"" I told her.
""Thank you,"" she said.
""Let's start by finding out who you are,"" I suggested.
""All right,"" she agreed.
We went to the library and spent the rest of the day researching. We read about the history of the mirror and the people who used it. The more we learned, the more confused we became. None of it made sense.
""We should probably talk to someone who knows about these mirrors,"" I said.
""Like who?"" asked Marie.
""Maybe the professor,"" I suggested.
""Professor Jones?"" she asked.
""That's the one,"" I confirmed.
""Do you think he'll believe us?"" she wondered.
""Probably not,"" I admitted. ""But we have to try. Besides, maybe he can tell us who you really are.""
""Okay,"" she said.
We went to his office and knocked on the door. He opened it and looked surprised to see us.
""Jason, what a surprise,"" he said. ""Is everything okay?""
""We wanted to ask you some questions,"" I said.
""Of course,"" he replied. ""Come in and sit down. I'll get us some coffee.""
We sat down and he handed us each a cup of coffee.
""So, what can I do for you today?"" he asked.
""We were wondering if you could tell us anything about the mirror,"" I explained.
""Oh, yes,"" he said. ""I remember it well. It was quite the mystery back in the day. The first person who discovered it was a young girl named Mary. She was living alone in the forest when she came across the mirror. She was very curious so she tried using it. To her amazement, it worked.",1078,-0.2930367549516338,0.3398434693027596,1.8701522208353236,1.3262351668881858,0.8375016912137584
64,R_2Scvt9LSxJZBsG0,OUR_HR_2,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. His stomach had gone sour.
""I have to leave,"" she said. ""You are here. And you look so . . . familiar.""
She said it in an offhanded manner. But then, that was how it always seemed when she spoke. Her words were not the usual meaningless chatter of women who don't know what they're saying; they carried meaning. And she had looked at him with such complete loathing, as though he disgusted her, that he was surprised she didn't throw up on him.
But she didn't. Instead, she left and went out onto the street. A few moments later, two men came in after her and sat down at her table.
When they'd been there a short while, he saw one of them go to the bar for something to drink. He grabbed the woman by the arm and pulled her back. She screamed but wouldn't let go of the man she was with.
""Let go!"" she shouted. ""Or I will scream so loud the whole tavern will hear.""
The other man started to object but she slapped his face. They both stared at her in stunned silence as she yanked her arm free of his grasp and left the tavern, heading outside into the rain.
""Who is that?"" he heard the man who had been drinking ask the tavern keeper.
""I don't know,"" the man replied. ""She just got in tonight.""
The second man gave him a disbelieving look and walked out into the night.
After she was gone, he watched her walk a few more paces before turning and looking over her shoulder at him. The look was so sharp, it made him wince.
He couldn't remember ever having seen anyone look at him like that, not even his parents when he did something stupid. But there was something about her, something cold and calculating and detached. As if she didn't care about him at all.
""Get out of here, boy,"" she said. ""You have no business being here.""
""I was just leaving,"" he muttered. He was sure he sounded sullen, as well. He hadn't meant to, but his feelings were hurt and he didn't want to be anywhere near her.
She snorted as if he were a fool. ""Oh, please. Do you think I care about your feelings? You are not the first man who has looked at me, but I have never cared."" She turned her face away and began walking toward her lodging.
It was almost a relief to see her go, to be relieved that he was no longer staring at her. He'd never felt like this before, and it bothered him. Not wanting to be where someone had seen him; that wasn't part of him. But the look in her eyes when she said he disgusted her . . . That wasn't him either.
After she was gone, he went back inside. The tavern keeper looked at him with a kind of pitying expression on his face.
""I don't know what happened,"" the man said. ""She just came in and sat down."" He looked around to make sure no one else was listening. ""Maybe she doesn't know how to talk to people.""
""Why would she come in here?"" the boy asked. ""It's not her kind of place. It smells awful.""
The tavern keeper shrugged. ""I've always wondered that myself. You might try talking to her. She looks so lost.""
""What makes you think she's lost? She just came in, right? Why shouldn't she have a drink and some food and leave?""
""Sometimes we don't know why these things happen,"" the tavern keeper said. ""She is clearly someone different from most of the girls you see here."" He cocked his head as he thought about it. ""And there is something else about her, although I can't quite put my finger on what it is.""
""It's not her. It must be because of the rain,"" the boy said. He ran out into the night, splashing through puddles. The rain had started up again, and he could hear it drumming against his window.
He was soaked by the time he got to the inn where she lived. The front door was locked, so he let himself in through a window. He climbed the stairs to her room. The door was open. He went inside.
He stood in the darkness, breathing heavily. A lamp burned on the table, but its light didn't reach the bed. There were only two candles, both in their holders on the night stand. As he looked at them, his eyes grew heavy, and he sank to the floor.
When he woke, it was morning. He saw that he hadn't fallen all the way off the edge of the bed, which meant he wasn't dead or injured. He blinked at the ceiling and tried to figure out how long he'd been asleep. It must have been only a few minutes, he thought. He still felt groggy, as if he hadn't slept well. He yawned and rubbed his eyes.
He sat up. Someone was sitting on the bed beside him. He glanced over and saw that it was the woman he had seen last night. Her face was pale, her eyes puffy. She seemed very tired.
She lifted her hand toward the candle flame.
""I have something to say,"" she whispered. ""You are the man who was in the tavern.""
""Yes,"" he said.
""And you were not the only one looking at me. One of those men was staring at me. I can see it in your eyes now, even though you won't look at me. You disgust me because you are the same as they are. I would rather be dead than live with such filth. I am going to burn my flesh before I let myself fall into such a pitiful state.""
He tried to get up, but she put a hand on his shoulder, holding him down.
""Wait,"" she said, ""there is more. I want you to know something else, before . . .""
But she couldn't finish, because the door burst open. The two men came in. One of them grabbed the boy by the arm and started dragging him across the room. His feet dragged over the floor, making a sound like broken glass.
""Stop! What are you doing?"" the woman shouted. ""Let go of him!""
The other man laughed. ""He's just a boy,"" he said.
She jumped up off the bed and rushed over to the boy, but the man had her by the throat. ""Don't come any closer,"" he said. ""Or you're next.""
She struggled against him but the man tightened his grip. He tossed her aside, as if she were a child, and looked at the boy.
""You,"" he said to him, ""have been nothing but trouble for us. It's time you paid the price.""",1176,-0.31652533813740485,-0.993710027371624,-0.8281629997242619,-1.339120764653997,-0.359562799801167

The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is where we will begin,"" said Lord Vellorin, his face set in a grim expression as he led them down the path that ran along the water's edge towards the town. ""If you are willing to put your lives on the line then I can promise you this; there will be no one else here who can help us."" He paused and glanced back at his men before continuing. ""I would prefer if only those who were truly dedicated to this quest joined us but we cannot force anyone. If someone wants nothing more than to live a simple life without being drawn into these troubles then so be it. You have my thanks for even coming here today. We shall make sure everyone gets what they want in return for joining our cause.""
Lord Vellorin led them around the shore until they came to an area of the shoreline that had been cleared of underbrush. Here stood a large stone structure that was easily three times the height of a man and almost twice as long. From its base rose several tall pillars that reached upwards towards the heavens and ended in a great dome above which floated a single enormous crystal that shimmered with an inner light.
""We call this place the Temple of Light,"" said Lord Vellorin as he walked past them. ""It was built by the people of the city of D'Rhin many years ago but now it stands empty except for a few priests who come here once a year to cleanse the crystals and perform the rituals needed to keep them intact. There is also a room beneath the temple that contains the heartstone that keeps the power flowing through it and a small chamber behind that which houses the book of prophecies."" He stopped just inside the doorway and turned to look at his men. ""Are you ready?""
They nodded silently as they stared ahead into the darkness within the temple. They could hear the sounds of the river flowing nearby and the birds calling to each other but otherwise there seemed to be no one about.
""Remember, there is no turning back once we enter the temple,"" continued Lord Vellorin. ""There is no way out of here save through me and I am not going to let any of you leave. If you choose to remain outside the temple then I will do everything in my power to stop you but you must know that your chances of survival are minimal. If you are still determined to stay, then please step forward and wait here."" He smiled briefly before stepping further inside. ""Good luck gentlemen.""
A moment later the door shut and there was silence.
""Let us see how brave they really are,"" said Lord Vellorin softly.
He stepped into the entranceway and began walking slowly deeper into the building, his hand resting lightly upon the hilt of his sword as he did so.
""Come on then,"" called Lord Vellorin loudly. ""What are you waiting for? Let us begin!""
His voice echoed eerily throughout the interior of the temple. His men followed him closely, keeping close together. None dared to turn their backs to the darkness that stretched out before them but none made any attempt to flee either. All waited quietly as they followed Lord Vellorin into the unknown.
As they moved deeper into the temple, they saw that the floor was covered in fine sand that sparkled like diamonds. The walls glowed brightly with an inner light that made it seem as though they were walking through a tunnel of purest gold. As they went farther inwards, the light dimmed somewhat but the feeling of warmth and serenity remained.
""You're right,"" whispered one of the men nervously. ""I don't feel afraid anymore. This feels good.""
Another man added, ""I think we should continue on.""
Lord Vellorin laughed softly. ""I'm glad to hear that! Come on, we haven't much time left.""
With that he started moving faster down the corridor, leading his men onward. Soon they came to a crossroads where four paths branched off. Each branch had its own unique colour and Lord Vellorin led them to the red one. At first he kept walking straight but after a short while he turned left and followed the passage. After another ten minutes or so he took a right turn and found himself following a narrow passage between two towering columns. The passage was lit by a glowing ball of white energy that hung suspended directly in front of them.
Lord Vellorin paused momentarily and glanced back at his men before speaking again. ""I hope you've all chosen wisely because there's no turning back from here.""
""What if we chose wrong?"" asked one of the men timidly.
Lord Vellorin shook his head. ""Then I'll take care of it myself but I doubt I'd survive doing it alone so I wouldn't worry too much about it."" He frowned thoughtfully. ""I suppose I could always go back for you but I don't want to waste my time on such trivial things.""
After a brief pause, he resumed his walk down the passageway. A little while later he heard footsteps echoing through the corridor behind him. When he looked over his shoulder, he saw his men standing motionless. He couldn't tell exactly how many of them there were but there were certainly more than five.
""Well, well,"" said Lord Vellorin quietly. ""If it isn't the leader of this rabble. It's a shame I won't be able to kill all of you personally but I guess I can settle for killing you instead.""
The footsteps continued steadily towards him. He watched carefully but the figure never revealed itself.
""Why are you running away from me?"" shouted Lord Vellorin angrily. ""I didn't say anything insulting yet you still run. Do you know who I am? I am the most powerful wizard in all of the Kingdom. Even the High Priest has never seen my like.""
There were a few chuckles amongst his followers.
""Oh yes, that's quite true,"" agreed a woman. ""I've heard that story before. What a pity that it wasn't true.""
Lord Vellorin spun around quickly, his sword raised high above his head. ""Who spoke?!""
The woman smirked. ""I did. You should have listened when I warned you.""
Lord Vellorin lowered his sword and sheathed it. ""I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. You were right. My magic does not work here.""
""Of course it doesn't,"" replied the woman. ""I told you that you would find nothing here. You might as well give up now and try something else.""
""Give up?"" cried Lord Vellorin in shock. ""Do you realize who you're talking to? How dare you talk to me like this!""
Lord Vellorin felt his anger rising but he managed to hold it in check. He stared at the woman for several seconds and then turned to his men. ""I apologize for my outburst.",1234,1.8727472480886131,0.1946748630054579,0.2705809633248101,-1.3662857979415597,-1.0285524233506764

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I made my way across town to the presidential palace where I would be meeting with the president himself. As I approached, I saw a small crowd forming outside of the gates, but no one was actually waiting there. Curious, I walked up and asked what they were all standing around for. One man told me that he had heard the president had arrived yesterday.
""You mean the president is here?"" I asked, surprised by the news. He nodded.
""Yes. We've been expecting you,"" he replied.
I shook his hand then turned towards the front doors when another person stepped forward and told me not to go any further. I looked back at him confused as he handed me a badge with a number printed on it. ""This will get you through security. You'll need it to enter the inner circle,"" he said, pointing to the line of people who had gathered behind me. I put my hands inside my pockets, trying to figure out why they'd give me a badge if they didn't want me to go in. When I thought about it, it made sense. The only reason anyone would ever be given a badge like that was because they were expected to show up somewhere. And since they were giving them away now, obviously someone had come to see me today.
That was enough for me. I put the badge on and went into the palace, walking past several armed guards who eyed me warily as I passed. Inside, I was greeted by two other men wearing similar badges, which meant I could proceed deeper into the compound. Once inside, I followed the signs until I came to a set of double doors that led to the president's office. I walked in, passing several more security checkpoints along the way, finally arriving at the president's office.
The room was large and well decorated, filled with paintings of historical figures, sculptures of important scientists, and various artifacts of ancient civilizations. It wasn't quite as impressive as some of the rooms in the White House or even Buckingham Palace, but it still held its own. A man in a black suit stood next to the door, looking at me expectantly as I approached. ""Good morning, Mr. Smith,"" he said as I entered the room. His voice sounded familiar, though I couldn't place it. ""I'm President Theodore Roosevelt.""
""Hello, Mr. President,"" I said, shaking his hand. ""My name is Peter Smith, and I believe you know my father.""
The president smiled warmly. ""Of course I do. I understand your family has been very supportive of our efforts here on Mars.""
""Yes sir, we certainly have. That's why I'm here today,"" I explained.
President Roosevelt nodded, motioning to the seat across from his desk. ""Please, take a seat. There's something I wanted to discuss with you.""
""What did you wish to speak with me about, Mr. President? Was it something related to the work I'm doing on Mars?"" I asked.
""Not exactly, though I think you might find it interesting. First, let me apologize for making you wait so long for my arrival,"" he began, sitting down in his chair. ""It's just that we've received a lot of attention recently, both positive and negative, and I felt it best to avoid unnecessary distractions while we're dealing with everything else going on here.""
I sat down too and nodded. ""No problem, Mr. President. I can appreciate how busy you must be right now. Is there anything I can help you with?""
The president smiled again. ""Actually, yes. I was hoping you might be able to assist us with a new initiative.""
""New initiative?"" I repeated.
""Yes. I've spoken with many of my advisors about this idea, and they all agree it would be beneficial to humanity, particularly if implemented early enough,"" he explained.
""Early enough?"" I questioned. ""For what purpose?""
""We're working hard to prepare for a future where humans may have to leave Earth entirely,"" he answered.
""Leave Earth…you mean go to another planet?"" I asked incredulously.
""Precisely,"" he confirmed. ""Right now, we don't have any plans to abandon our home world, but we're always prepared for such an eventuality. In fact, I think it would be wise to begin preparing for such a move immediately rather than waiting until we absolutely have to make the decision to evacuate. If we start moving things off-planet now, it should make things easier when it comes time to relocate.""
""Moving things off-planet…that sounds expensive,"" I remarked.
""Well, it would be. But we are talking about a much larger undertaking than simply relocating a few hundred thousand people,"" he noted.
""How big?"" I asked, curious.
""Let's just say there's no shortage of people willing to invest in the endeavor. We'd also need to build a ship capable of carrying millions of people, and there are plenty of companies and private investors who are interested in participating,"" he said.
""A ship…carrying millions?"" I asked. ""I thought the first mission to Mars only carried a couple of dozen astronauts.""
""Those were test missions. We needed to make sure the technology worked before sending humans there permanently. Our current plan calls for launching a fleet of ships, each carrying thousands of passengers and cargo,"" he explained. ""Once the ships arrive on Mars, they'll unload their supplies and equipment then send the remaining passengers to the surface. They'll be joined by additional ships as the population grows over time.""
I shook my head, thinking it all seemed incredibly risky. ""If the colony fails, everyone dies,"" I pointed out.
""Yes, I suppose you're right,"" the president agreed. ""But we believe the risks are worth taking. Not only would it give us a second chance at life, but it could also pave the way for the expansion of human civilization beyond our solar system. After all, once we've established ourselves on Mars, there's nothing stopping us from exploring the rest of the galaxy. We'll be free to travel anywhere in the universe.""
I shook my head. ""That's a lot to ask of anyone. Even if the risk is worthwhile, it seems like it would take a significant amount of money to pull it off.""
""We already have a good chunk of the funding,"" the president replied. ""In addition to the investments I mentioned earlier, several major corporations and private investors have pledged to contribute. I just need you to get the word out and encourage others to join the cause.""
""I'll do what I can,"" I assured him. ""Though I imagine the president of the United States isn't the best person to be asking for donations.""
The president chuckled. ""You're probably correct,"" he admitted. ""But I've got a feeling you'll come up with a solution to that problem soon enough.",1192,1.9836855403821452,0.9240450218871568,-0.3893058334185737,0.8769410695437835,0.49109457316508
67,R_3rGtXB26dgkcenb,OUR_HSF_2,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
My head pounded as if I'd been drinking all night; my eyes were sore and bloodshot.
I looked at the envelope in my hand and opened it to find a note, written on a simple piece of paper and sealed with red wax. I picked up the phone on my desk and dialed the number Dr. Sato had given me. The call went through quickly, and soon a voice answered: the president himself.
""Hello?"" He sounded like he'd just woken up. ""Hello? Is anyone there? Hello?""
I held the receiver away from my ear as if I was going to throw it against something.
""Hi,"" I said slowly. ""It's me.""
He made no reply but didn't hang up either. After a few moments the line clicked off.
I sat on the edge of my bed and put my hands to my temples, massaging them lightly. The president had called me here with this cryptic message; obviously he wanted something.
A thought struck me, and I got up from my bed to get my car keys and wallet from my pocket. As I did so, I realized that I still had no idea what I should be doing. I mean, I could hardly ask Dr. Sato to do my job for me! If she found out what I'd done, I'd never hear the end of it, and who knew what would happen to me.
I took a deep breath and went out my door. I paused before stepping outside into the sunlight. What had the president meant when he said ""this afternoon""? It wasn't even midday yet, let alone an evening or night. I went to the parking garage down the street from my apartment and put my car keys and wallet in the glove box.
Then I drove off, heading down the main boulevard of the city. It was the same route I used to take when I'd come back from my trips to Earth. My stomach clenched at the sight of it; I knew that if I didn't get this right, then the only thing that was going to happen was I was going to die.
I parked near the center of town and walked through the shopping district until I came to the hotel where I had my last meeting with the president. I made sure that nobody was around before opening the front door of the building; I couldn't risk being seen here. There were a few people outside, chatting, but they paid little attention to me.
I entered the lobby and saw two men behind a small counter. They glanced up at me as I walked in, and then went back to their business.
""Hello?"" one of them asked after a moment. I hadn't spoken to anybody here in over a year, so it took him a moment to recognize who I was.
""Hi,"" I said, feeling nervous about having to do this. ""I need to speak with the president.""
He turned to look at me again.
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said after a few seconds. ""But the president is not in his office at the moment. Do you have an appointment?""
""I don't need one,"" I said quickly. ""He asked me to come and meet him.""
The man looked confused for a moment.
""Oh… I see."" He started typing on a computer. ""Sir, I will go and make an announcement that you are here, and ask the president if he can spare some time to speak with you. If he does, he'll be out in a moment.""
He looked up at me expectantly. I stood there silently as he typed something else into the computer. Then, as I waited, he brought his gaze back up to me.
""What's your name?""
""Hiroto Kana,"" I said.
""Okay,"" he said. ""Thank you."" He turned his attention back to the computer and typed quickly. After a few moments he looked back up to me.
""Mr. Kana has just arrived to see you. Please wait a moment.""
He turned and walked off, heading towards a doorway behind him.
I nodded to myself and took a seat on one of the couches. The president had never done this before—not that he would have ever asked me to do anything like this when we were both on Earth. I sat there nervously, looking around at the people in the lobby, and then glanced over at the counter where the man had been standing. His computer was now off.
A few minutes passed before the door opened and a man in his mid-thirties came out, walking casually towards me.
He had short black hair, which he brushed backwards from his forehead with one hand; he wore a blue suit that looked slightly wrinkled, as though he'd only recently put it on.
He smiled at me as he walked down the steps.
""Mr. Kana,"" he said. ""It's good to see you again.""
He reached out a hand, and I took it and shook it firmly.
""And you,"" I said. ""It's nice to meet you in person.""
The president nodded, a wry smile playing across his face for a moment. ""Come,"" he said. ""Let's not stand around in here.""
We walked together into an elevator, then headed up to the third floor, where the president's office was. He didn't say anything on the way up, and I remained silent too, unsure what to say.
As soon as we entered the room, he turned to face me.
""Do you have it?"" he asked.
""Yes, sir,"" I replied. ""It's ready for you to take back to Earth.""
""Good,"" he said. ""That's one problem solved. Now we just have to wait and see what the rest of the situation will be.""
He leaned forward in his chair.
""Before I show it to you,"" he continued, ""there's something I need to explain to you. I know this sounds crazy, but… well, you'll see. It's hard to explain, so let me start at the beginning.""
He looked up to me and paused.
I hesitated, too, trying to find the right words. I'd already heard something about this, so it seemed strange that the president would choose this moment to tell me all this, but it was his decision, and I had no way to argue with him.
""If it were possible,"" he began, ""if there was some way to bring life-forms from Earth to Mars, and if it were possible to make it look like they'd been living here for years—perhaps even millions of years—wouldn't we want to do that?""
""Why?"" I asked.
""To start with,"" he said, ""because we could put them to work. We could use their expertise. We could hire them and pay them well. They could help us out on a whole host of different levels. In fact, they'd be able to teach us many things we don't have the knowledge to understand yet.""",1210,-1.9581368959374432,-0.6158349776078715,-0.0204806703127635,0.6899278835368629,-1.5527861857903469
68,R_3R2y4Otf6uy0UGS,BAS_HF_1,High Fantasy,Basic Coherence,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It's too early,"" said Saphira. ""Why is no one here?""
Grimnir pointed toward the eastern tower. ""That one looks occupied.""
They flew closer until they were able to see movement within. A man stood outside, staring northward as if he could see something that none of them could. He wore black robes trimmed with white fur around his neck and shoulders. His long hair fell down his back in thick waves, and his eyes had an intense gleam about them. He was tall and thin, and he carried himself with an air of authority.
Saphira landed on the ground beside him while Grimnir circled above her, scanning the area. There was nothing else to do but wait; however, this man seemed to have forgotten that dragons existed. He stared straight ahead without even noticing their approach.
As they drew close enough to speak, Saphira spoke first. ""I am Saphira. Who are you?""
He turned slowly toward her. ""You know who I am? You must be a very powerful dragon indeed.""
""Yes, I am."" She nodded. ""And you?""
""My name is Arathanial. What brings you so far south?""
She didn't answer right away. Instead she studied him carefully. ""Are you alone?""
""Of course not. I live here.""
""Where is everyone else?""
Arathanial shrugged. ""I don't know. They've been gone for months now. Maybe years.""
""What happened here?""
""There was a war. My brother and my father both died fighting it.""
""Your brother and your father fought in the same battle?"" asked Saphira.
""No, they were killed separately.""
""How many others died?""
""Many more than just my family. Many other people lost their lives as well.""
""Who did this?""
""A group called the Dark Knights. Their leader is named Bordan.""
""Bordan? That sounds familiar…""
""Do you know where he is now?""
Saphira shook her head. ""I'm sorry, I don't. But I can tell you where we last saw him.""
""Thank you,"" said Arathanial. ""Come inside. I'll show you.""
He led them through the gates of the village and into a large building made of stone blocks. It had three floors, each one much taller than any human dwelling. The floor beneath their feet was covered in carpets woven from wool. At the center of the room was a table surrounded by chairs. A fire burned brightly in the hearth, casting dancing shadows across the walls. On the wall opposite the door hung several paintings of landscapes and seascapes. One of them showed a mountain range that extended from the northern tip of the continent all the way to the southern coast. Another depicted a city in the middle of a forest, and another was of a waterfall pouring off of a cliff.
Arathanial walked over to one of the paintings and ran his hand along the frame. ""This is what our land once looked like before the Dark Knights came.""
Saphira leaned forward, trying to get a better look. She'd never seen such beautiful artwork before. ""Is this real?""
""Yes. This is how the world used to be before the Dark Knights destroyed everything. They took our lands and forced us to leave.""
""Why would anyone do that?"" asked Grimnir.
""Because they wanted to rule the world themselves. They thought they could make it a better place.""
""But why?"" asked Saphira.
""I don't know. They're evil. They only care about power and money. They think they can change the world and make it better, but they couldn't be more wrong. If they really cared about making things better, then they wouldn't have started wars and caused so much death. And they certainly wouldn't have taken the lives of innocent people. They're monsters, Saphira. They are the worst kind of people there are.""
Saphira listened intently, taking in every word. She had heard similar stories before. People who lived in the north often told tales of the Dark Knights and their terrible deeds. Some said they were demons sent to punish the wicked, while others believed they were the fallen angels cast out of heaven. Either way, they were considered to be the most vile creatures ever created.
""Did you know them personally?"" asked Saphira.
""Yes, I knew them. I grew up with them. We were friends. I loved my brother, and my father was my hero. Now they're dead because of the Dark Knights.""
""Was there anything else you could tell me about them?""
""Not really. I remember them being cruel and heartless. They hated everyone except for themselves. They treated those closest to them like slaves, and they were always scheming to take control of the kingdom.""
""So they were greedy?""
""Yes, that's the word for it. They wanted everything for themselves, and they didn't care who got hurt or killed in the process.""
""And they still want to rule the world?""
""Yes, that's exactly what they're planning to do. They plan on conquering all of the kingdoms and uniting them under their own banner. Then they will conquer the rest of the world and bring it under their control. They say it will be peaceful, but I don't believe them for a second.""
""Why do they hate humans so much?"" asked Saphira.
""I don't know. Perhaps they feel threatened by us, or perhaps they simply enjoy killing. Whatever the reason, they are a plague upon the earth, and they must be stopped. That is why I'm here. That is why I need your help.""
""We'll stop them,"" promised Grimnir.
""Thank you.""
""What should we do first?"" asked Saphira.
""First, I want you to go and find my brother. He was traveling with a young woman named Larka. Tell them that I sent you.""
""All right,"" agreed Saphira. ""Then what?""
""After that, I want you to fly to the capital and tell the king what you've learned. He needs to know about this threat. He must prepare his army to fight these Dark Knights. And then, when you return, I want you to destroy the Dark Knight camp in the north. That is where they are hiding.""",1080,1.5237699333085477,0.1453348197328975,-0.5709450770321407,0.14477887670859102,1.577019945699898
69,R_1q4VuET0w3z6KwM,LOW_HF_9,High Fantasy,Low Rider,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
They found the inn easily enough. It had once been called 'the Golden Goose', and that had not changed since it had been built, though its sign now read simply 'The Inn'. There were no people there. No servants, no cooks, no barkeeps. It would have appeared as if it was still open to anyone who might want food and drink – and perhaps something else after dark – but none came to claim it, nor was any food or drinks offered to them.
""There should be people,"" said Kvothe. ""This is an inn."" He looked around carefully before adding, ""Unless they're all hiding under the tables. That's possible, isn't it?""
""We've met with a few innkeepers whose establishments were abandoned during my travels,"" said Elodin, walking across the yard towards the door. ""I'll take care of things here. You go talk to her.""
""Her? Who?""
Kvothe sighed. ""The girl. The one in the tower. We need to find her.""
The inside of the inn was much as he expected. Tables scattered across the floor littered with old plates and mugs. In places, the wood showed signs of heavy use, with burn marks from fireplaces in some rooms. The smell was the same too – dust, ash, beer and sweat. It was hard to tell which was worse, the smell of the place or the smell of the patrons; he had encountered both on his travels. It made him wonder why people ever wanted to come here. It certainly didn't make sense unless there was someone inside who kept everything running like clockwork. Perhaps the innkeeper could even control the weather outside so people never left.
He went to the door near where he'd first seen Elodin and knocked sharply three times. When there was no response, he tried again. After three more knocks, he stepped back and listened. Nothing came through the thick wooden door, but just to be certain, he put his ear against it.
Nothing.
It seemed odd, given the number of travelers who stopped here. He wondered how many of them were aware that the inn wasn't actually open to guests. He imagined there weren't many – maybe not even any. Most people would assume that it was merely closed for repairs or renovations. But the girl… she wouldn't have known. She must have been very young when it happened.
Maybe they were right, he thought. Maybe I shouldn't be doing this. This may well turn out to be a mistake.
But it was too late to change his mind now. He pushed away from the door and walked back to join Elodin. As he approached, he saw that the wizard was crouched down beside a table. The wood was stained with blood and the tablecloth had been pulled up and twisted in the middle as if it had been used to restrain someone.
Elodin rose quickly when he noticed Kvothe coming up behind him. ""She's alive! Thank the gods!""
""What happened?"" Kvothe asked, hurrying forward to see for himself. He reached out tentatively, but Elodin held up a hand to stop him from touching anything.
""I don't know. She woke up a little while ago, screamed and then passed out. Whatever did this, it's gone now, but I'm afraid that she hasn't woken yet.""
Kvothe knelt and gently took her hand. Her skin was cool and soft, like wet sandpaper. It felt strange beneath his fingers, like it belonged somewhere else.
""How do you feel?"" he asked quietly. ""Can you hear me?""
For a moment there was only silence, and Kvothe began to hope that she wasn't really awake, and that he hadn't imagined her voice. Then he heard a weak breath, followed by a moan that sounded like it hurt.
""Don't talk,"" he said. ""You need to rest. Just lie still.""
Her eyes fluttered open and stared into nothingness. She turned her head slowly until she was looking directly at Kvothe, and he could see the confusion in her gaze. She blinked several times as if trying to clear her vision, and then her eyelids fell shut again.
""I can't see,"" she whispered in a low voice. ""I can't see… what's happening…""
Kvothe stood and drew in a deep breath. He could feel the heat rising from his hands, even though they were nowhere near her. He was getting angry, which was a bad thing, because anger often led to rash actions, and he needed to think before he acted. But it also helped to focus his thoughts on something other than what he was feeling. And there was something else that he wanted to try first. He took another deep breath and let it out slowly. He concentrated on his breathing, and tried to picture the air passing through his lungs and into his body, filling him with strength and energy. When he opened his mouth he realized that it was almost impossible to keep his jaw clenched.
""Where am I?"" she whispered.
""This is The Inn,"" he told her. ""And I am Kvothe.""
""Who are you?"" she asked.
""No,"" said Kvothe, ""I mean… who am I to you?""
""My father,"" she answered without hesitation. ""He always says I should remember you, but I don't. How do I know your name?""
""Well,"" said Kvothe slowly, ""it might help if we knew each other's names."" He reached into the pocket of his robe and drew forth a coin that glowed with faint green light. He held it up between his thumb and forefinger as he spoke. ""Do you recognize this?""
The girl's brow furrowed and she struggled to focus on it. ""Yes,"" she said. ""A darkeater, isn't it?""
""That's right,"" he replied. ""It's a magical coin that will reveal whatever is written upon it, if the person holding it is capable of deciphering the writing.""
""Why do you have a darkeater? Where did you get it?""
Kvothe hesitated. He wasn't sure he should tell her. She probably couldn't understand what it meant, and it wasn't exactly something a child should know about. But it wouldn't do any good to withhold information from her now. Besides, it might be useful later on to explain how he had learned about her father's plans for her.
""Someone gave it to me,"" he said finally, ""and told me to give it to you.""
""So, you're supposed to tell me my father's name?"" she asked.
""That's right.""
The girl frowned. ""If he gave this to me, why am I lying here bleeding in a strange room?""",1161,-0.47971222053573065,-0.24895116776073467,-1.7217348951693225,1.4701037065604703,0.40566443268580155
70,R_1f6El0NSHzfO1mn,LOW_HOR_10,Horror,Low Rider,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was not one that I recognized. It had long black hair, dark eyes like mine, but they were filled with fear as she stared back at me from the reflection. I started panicking and turned around quickly before the woman could see my naked body or my cock in its full glory. After running all of the way downstairs, I found my father and brother asleep in front of the TV. I went to my room and closed the door. This was no dream; I had been visited by an alien ghost! What should I do?
I decided to take a shower, and when I came out I saw her standing there. She smiled at me, and I ran back inside. As soon as I shut the bathroom door, she opened it again. She looked right through the door and smiled again. The look on her face told me that she was going to get what she wanted. I knew that if I stayed in there another minute, then she would make good on her promise. So, I ran down the stairs again to find my dad snoring away. My brother wasn't home yet. I grabbed his car keys and drove away as fast as I could. I drove for about two hours until finally finding a motel near the highway. I took a shower, changed clothes, checked myself in the mirror, and then locked my door behind me. Then I waited for nightfall.
As soon as dark fell, I made sure to lock all of the windows in my room and pulled the covers all the way up to my neck before going to sleep. There was nothing else that I could do. I couldn't let her get me; I wasn't sure who she was or where she came from. But, I did know that whatever it was, it needed to be stopped. That's why I had to stop sleeping at night!
After three nights without sleep, the next day was finally here, so I called into work early. When I arrived, my boss asked me what was wrong and why I looked so worn out. I told him that I'd been really tired lately because I hadn't slept well recently. He didn't buy it for a second and said he would keep an eye on me just to be sure.
That afternoon, I bought some new curtains for my bedroom and hung them up. I had never seen anything like them before, but I liked the way they made everything darker. I spent the rest of the evening reading in bed before turning off the lights and trying to sleep. I didn't feel tired, so I read for almost two hours. I was about to turn off my light when I saw it move across the room again. It was her again! This time, she moved slowly and quietly towards my bed. The next thing I knew, she was standing in the doorway with her arms crossed over her chest as she grinned at me. ""So,"" she began, ""are you going to stay up all night or are you going to go to sleep?""
""What do you want? Are you going to kill me now?""
She laughed as she walked over to my bed and sat down. ""No, silly. I'm not going to hurt you."" She looked at me and continued speaking. ""I need something more than your life, though.""
I looked down and noticed that my cock was hard again. I tried to hide it but felt too embarrassed even when she told me that I could relax. Her hand touched my thigh and slid under the sheet. She wrapped her fingers around my cock and started stroking it gently. I could tell that she was very good at this, and she looked at me as she jerked me off. ""Now,"" she said, ""you're just making things difficult for yourself.""
I was breathing heavily by the time she finished jerking me off. She reached out and took hold of my balls as she continued talking to me. ""This is how it's going to work,"" she said as she stroked me faster and harder. ""You will have no choice but to sleep during the day while I can watch you at night."" Her pace picked up, and soon my head was spinning as she brought me to orgasm. She held me tight as I shook and shot cum onto the sheets beneath us. Then she kissed me passionately as I recovered from the blowjob.
""Good boy!"" she whispered in my ear before she stood up and left my room. Before I could say anything, she was gone for the last time. As soon as she was gone, I turned on the light and cleaned myself up. I was exhausted.
The next morning, my dad got home early from work so we could go fishing together before my brother came back. It was a lot of fun catching some trout and watching the sun set. We ate dinner as the sun started going down, and it reminded me of the time we used to spend fishing on vacation. It brought back so many memories, which is probably why I was able to fall asleep that night. It wasn't until I woke up again at 3 am that I realized that I had been having trouble sleeping lately.
I was dreaming about going fishing with my family when I felt someone shaking me awake. I rolled over, but there was nobody there. It must have been a nightmare because I fell back asleep instantly. As soon as I did, she came walking into my room with her arms crossed. ""It's time for you to go to sleep,"" she said calmly. I sat up in bed and looked at her. She had short red hair and dark green eyes that reflected the light from the moon outside. She wore a white shirt covered with small colorful flowers and a blue skirt.
""Why don't you just kill me?"" I asked, hoping she would leave me alone if I asked.
""I'm not going to hurt you,"" she replied. ""Not yet anyway."" Her smile seemed to taunt me as she looked down at me. I looked up at the ceiling as if she would be staring at me if I stared straight at her. She continued smiling at me. ""If I let you live, then I'll be stuck with you forever, and I really don't like that idea very much."" She leaned forward and kissed me on the lips while caressing my cock. She moaned as she did so. ""But, if I fuck you, then maybe I can control you better.""
Her hand moved up and down my cock as her mouth continued kissing me passionately. She pulled away from our kiss and looked into my eyes. ""Do you understand?"" She asked. ""You've been sleeping for days now, and I'm bored."" Her hand wrapped around my cock again as she stroked it slowly. She pushed me down to the bed and straddled me before guiding it inside of her. As I watched, she took her time and rode my cock while staring at me the whole time. She was incredibly hot and wet, which was why I didn't last long enough to satisfy her.",1270,0.6523501441001311,-0.26113424545538627,-0.44594236757547845,-0.49128499431454237,-1.3720605876401248

She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been working late that night, trying to catch up on all the things that hadn't been done when he took off for the winter months. His eyes followed her as she walked from the door to the table and then back again, with her arms crossed over her chest. She wore a long dark green dress with a matching cloak that reached halfway down her legs. It was not fancy but it fit well and showed off her curves. She wasn't tall, nor very short, and she had a good figure. Her hair was brown and curly, cut short around the sides and longer in the center. When she turned, he could see that she was pretty with large blue eyes and a wide mouth. Her lips were full and red and her nose small. He wondered how she would look without those clothes and the cloak.
She must have heard him sigh because she looked at him over her shoulder. ""Do you need help?"" she asked, her voice husky and deep.
He shook his head and she smiled. He knew immediately that she was beautiful. There was something about the way she moved that drew him in, made him want to know more about her. ""No, I'm fine,"" he said.
""Well, if you're sure..."" she began.
""Yes, I'm sure. Thank you."" He smiled at her, but she turned away and left the room. He watched until she was gone, and then went to close up the tavern for the night.
The next day, when he came to work, she was there again. He tried not to stare, but she caught him looking. ""Is there something wrong with my dress?"" she asked, smiling as she turned.
""Oh, no, not at all,"" he said, and felt himself blush as she gave him another smile before she turned away.
That was the first time they met. He didn't see her again for almost a week, when she came in on a Saturday afternoon. The tavern was nearly empty except for the few people who were still drinking and playing games. He sat down at one of the tables in front of her. It was the same table where he'd seen her the first time and he wanted to keep an eye on her.
She glanced at him but did not smile. She just stared at him and then turned back to the bar, waiting for someone to come and serve her. After a minute, she gave up and walked toward the door. He couldn't take his eyes off her as she walked from the room, so graceful and beautiful. She was tall, almost as tall as he was, with long legs and a narrow waist that tapered into a small rounded butt. He knew it wasn't the clothes or the cloak that made her look like a princess, it was because of her face and her body. When she walked, the material of the cloak flowed around her. He wondered what she would look like without it.
He watched her walk out of the tavern and then looked over at the woman who had served her. ""What's your name?"" he asked.
The woman shook her head. ""I don't know you. You're new here.""
He nodded. ""That's right. I'm Ben."" He reached into his pocket and pulled out some money. He dropped it onto the bar. ""Could you tell me her name?""
She frowned. ""No, she doesn't have to tell me anything about anyone.""
Ben took his hand back. ""Okay,"" he said, and left the tavern. He didn't want to make any more trouble for the woman, but he needed to know her name. He went outside and walked along the road, looking at the people walking by. There were men and women of all ages, and children too, but no one seemed familiar. He saw a woman and a child on horseback and they were riding past him. He stopped to watch them, and then they turned down another street. He started after them, hoping that she had been wearing a different dress. As they rode, he could see that the woman was tall and pretty, with long blonde hair and large blue eyes. Her dress was white, and she wore a light-colored cloak that reached just past her knees. It looked as if she was heading home.
As he walked down the road, he heard the sound of horses approaching him. He turned to see the same woman and child riding up to him. The woman smiled when she saw him and waved. ""Hi, Ben!"" she called. She reined in her horse and jumped off.
He walked over to meet her. ""Hello,"" he said. ""You look like a princess.""
She laughed and shook her head. ""No, I don't. I'm just a simple girl.""
He took her hands in his and looked into her eyes. ""But you're not so ordinary. You have a way of making people smile. They just see you and can't help smiling."" He took a deep breath and pulled her close. ""I've wanted to do this since the first time I saw you, and now I'm going to kiss you.""
She smiled. ""All right, then,"" she said, and put her arms around his neck. He bent toward her and kissed her, and it was everything he thought it would be. Her lips were soft and warm and full, and they melted against him. His arms wrapped around her waist and he pulled her closer to him. She smelled good, like flowers and honey and sunshine, and she felt so good against him that he could barely control himself.
When he finally broke the kiss, he smiled at her. ""That wasn't so bad, was it?"" he asked, laughing.
""No, it was great,"" she replied. ""And I'll tell you something else. I'm going to marry you when you come back from your adventure.""
He stared at her, unable to speak for a moment. Then he shook his head. ""That's not possible,"" he said.
""Why not? I love you and you love me, and that makes us married. If we want to be married, there is nothing that will keep us apart. Not even an ocean.""
He shook his head again. ""I'm not coming back, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that you are here, and that you know how I feel about you.""
She took his hand. ""I know, and I love you too."" She looked down and said quietly, ""And I hope that you won't die.""
""I'm afraid I will,"" he said. ""But that doesn't matter. Nothing can change what we feel for each other."" He kissed her again, and this time he didn't let her pull away. When he finally did, they were both breathing hard.
""Will you take my hand?"" he asked. She nodded. They walked together down the street, holding hands, and he felt happy and safe for the first time since he was a child.",1199,0.6327417294273274,-1.031670581306662,-0.0005430865367676854,-0.29946918216434915,-1.4815430323286132
72,R_2OSwFtwMEpBGnoa,OUR_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. Today, however, would be shorter than usual because of the eclipse, which was due to happen later today. The next time we'd have a full solar eclipse on Mars, it would be in two years. I got into the aircar, which I'd driven to work all of one other time since moving here. There was a line of cars parked along the road waiting to take people across the crater to their homes or offices. I recognized some of the faces—some were crew who lived here, and others were students like me who had been recruited by the government. When you moved to Mars, they sent you an aircar. It was a lot cheaper than flying yourself, though it was still expensive.
The car picked up speed as soon as I hit the throttle and started toward the city center. We drove over a small ridge and down toward the edge of the crater where I could see a series of craters with the famous white dome of Olympus Mons rising above them. Some of the craters had little houses around them, but most were empty. Many of the residents lived inside the crater in domes that were far bigger than the ones that housed us here on the surface. A few domes were occupied by families, while others held various government agencies and scientific research facilities. I'd never understood why there wasn't a city built underground to save energy and protect against radiation. If a big rock came crashing down from space, the city would probably be crushed by the force of the impact.
We turned south and flew over a patch of dark brown sand before circling around to the east where I could see a cluster of buildings on a low hill. It was my house. It was smaller than I had expected, which I thought was strange because of the fact that it sat right next to one of the largest lakes on Mars. The lake itself was the size of a large pond in Michigan, and the house was on a small island in the middle of it. The water looked calm, but I knew that there were dozens of different kinds of dangerous things living in the lake, such as leeches, poisonous jellyfish, and various fish. When I got home, I'd need to do a full inspection of the house to make sure that the various windows and doors were still intact, and that all of the solar panels were functioning properly. I hadn't been here in months, so I didn't really know what to expect.
The aircar slowed down as we approached the house. I looked out the window at my father standing by the side of the house as he waited for me. He smiled when he saw me looking, but then his face fell, and a look of sadness came over his face. A man that I assumed to be my father's new wife walked toward him and gave him a hug, and I could tell from her body language that she was happy to see him. I got out of the car, and my dad gave me a small wave before walking toward the house. The woman was standing at the front door, and as soon as she saw me, she turned around and started running back down the hill. My heart sank.
I looked back to see my mother sitting on the front steps of the house. She stood up when she saw me and waved. I smiled and waved back. There was no reason to be sad, though. This was probably going to be my new family. My new life on Mars. I hoped that they wouldn't keep me locked away like some kind of prisoner. I just wanted to live my life without any hassle.
We walked into the house together, and the woman followed us inside. ""Hi, I'm Ann. It's nice to meet you,"" the woman said to me. ""We have some food if you'd like to eat.""
""I appreciate it,"" I said.
""So, this is your son?"" she asked my father.
""Yes, he's going to stay here with us,"" my father replied. I had already heard the story of how I was discovered, but I still didn't understand how a little kid like me ended up here on Mars.
My mother went upstairs while Ann took me into the kitchen where there were several different things that I could smell. It smelled like pork and potatoes. ""It's lunchtime, so let me get your plate ready. You're hungry, aren't you?"" she said, opening up one of the cupboards. She pulled out a bag of potato chips and put them on the counter. ""What do you like to eat, Yuri?""
""I love pizza,"" I replied.
""That sounds perfect!"" she said, getting some plates and silverware out of another cabinet. I watched as she put on some kind of sauce, which she then used to coat the top of a big piece of bread. Then she placed slices of meat in the center and topped it off with cheese before placing the whole thing on a baking sheet. When she was done, she put it into the oven and set the timer.
""Do you like sports? I can take you to watch a basketball game later if you want."" She handed me two slices of pizza, which were both warm by the time we got outside again. ""How about I call a taxi and have him drop us off at the stadium?""
""Yes, please,"" I replied.
She took a seat next to me on the grass outside as I ate. Ann smiled as we chatted. ""How is school?"" she asked. ""Are you excited to start your program?""
""I think I'm going to like it here,"" I replied. ""Maybe even more than Earth.""
""That's good,"" she said. ""I hope you get along with your classmates.""
""I'm not really sure yet,"" I admitted. ""There are only six of us in my class, so it's going to be hard to get to know them.""
""Well, you'll definitely make friends once you've been here a while. You're very cute, so you should have no problem,"" Ann said with a smile. I couldn't help but blush as she spoke, and I had the urge to reach up and touch my hair. It was just so long.
After lunch, Ann asked me if I wanted to come with her to do some shopping in town. We hopped into the car and started driving east.
""Do you have a boyfriend?"" she asked.
""Not that I know of,"" I replied.
""You don't date much?""
""I guess not,"" I said, thinking back to high school. I hadn't dated a lot. There was one boy that I liked, but he didn't go to my school. He'd gotten in trouble for cheating on tests, which I thought was ridiculous. The only reason I was interested in him at all was because I had a crush on his older brother. But it turned out that I wasn't supposed to know who his brothers were. That's why the teachers let him leave school early to hang out with me after class. I never learned who his real family was, and neither did he.",1274,0.46566531813285456,0.11908839083826406,-0.5612471325421111,1.2412976072658624,0.4907186947738623
73,R_qEqGYykdtR5o3jr,MOR_HR_10,Historical Romance,Morpho,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd watched her, his gaze drawn to her like a fish to light. Her hair was a mass of curls, her eyes the deepest blue he'd ever seen and her lips red and full.
She'd been looking at him, too, and it wasn't until he caught her watching him that he realized she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.
She'd taken off her hat and her hair fell in waves down her back. She wore a long, brown dress, the fabric so fine it was almost see-through. Her dress wasn't even dirty. It was as if she'd been born in it.
A man at the table across from her had leaned over and said something to her. She hadn't looked at him, she'd just smiled at him, and the warmth of it had spread from his chest to his groin.
He'd been so embarrassed by that reaction that he'd left the tavern without taking a drink. He hurried down the street to an alley, his heart pounding so hard he could barely breathe.
He hadn't been able to go back to work for three days after that. He'd spent that time at home, watching the window, waiting for her to reappear. When she finally did, he was determined not to let her out of his sight again.
She was still beautiful to him after all these years. He wasn't sure if that made him a complete fool or a complete fool, but he'd never once stopped thinking about her.
He didn't know how old she was. He didn't know where in Ireland she was from or what name she had. He didn't know anything about her at all, except that she made him feel things that were too intense for him.
He didn't know how long he would stay away from his family and friends before he couldn't stand it anymore and went back to face them again. At least this way, he had someone waiting for him when he came home.
He thought of her often now when he missed her. It was always when he needed a reminder of what it felt like to be young and carefree again.
He tried to tell himself that this was just a temporary thing that would end when she went back to her own life, but the truth was, he'd never met anyone like her before or since.
He knew he was going to see her again when he saw the house she'd rented for herself on his way into town. He remembered the way it looked from the window of the tavern and smiled at the memory of how different it looked from this perspective.
The house wasn't large by any means, but it was obviously taken care of well. It had two stories and an attic, and there were small gardens off to either side of it that were full of flowers he hadn't seen before in Ireland.
He pulled up in front of the house and got out of the car, closing the door behind him with a sigh of satisfaction. He was home.
""It's good to see you,"" she said as she stepped out of the house and looked up at him with open arms.
He wrapped his arms around her and held on for a moment before stepping back so he could look down into her face again. ""It's good to see you.""
""Are you going to tell me what you've been doing all these years?"" she asked as she stepped closer and looked up at him questioningly.
""It's a long story,"" he said as he slid his hand around to the small of her back. ""I think we should go inside for that.""
""I thought you said you were going to tell me."" She frowned as she looked up at him again, clearly annoyed with him now that she knew what he wanted from her.
He put his hand on her shoulder and laughed gently as he looked down at her again. ""I will tell you everything,"" he promised her as he placed his other hand over hers on his shoulder in an attempt to stop her from pulling away from him again. ""But I'm hungry and I want something to eat first.""
""I'm sure I have some food in there,"" she said as she looked up at him again and smiled sweetly at him.
""You have some food in there?"" He frowned as he thought about all the days he'd spent watching her through the window in the tavern before finally stopping by one day to see if she was there. ""Are you sure?""
""Yes,"" she said as she nodded enthusiastically at him before stepping back and reaching up to touch the buttons on his shirt with long fingers. ""Why don't you come inside with me and I'll show you.""
""Why don't I come inside with you?"" He grinned at her as he looked down into those dark blue eyes again. ""I think I might like that.""
She laughed softly as she nodded vigorously at him, clearly pleased that he wanted to come inside with her after all this time. ""I'll go get some food ready while you get your things from the car.""
""I'm not going,"" he said as he pulled her hand down from the buttons on his shirt and held it in his own palm instead. ""I'm staying here with you.""
She smiled up at him as if she thought that was wonderful news and leaned forward to kiss his cheek before walking inside ahead of him. He followed behind her, watching as she moved gracefully around the small house, carrying things from the kitchen out into the small yard in front of it where there was a table and chairs set up for eating outside on nice days like today.
It was an idyllic scene with the bright sun shining down on them through the trees outside while they ate their lunch together on the table off to one side of the house instead. She'd made some sandwiches for them after they'd finished eating the bread and cheese slices they'd gotten from town earlier in the day. He'd had no idea how long it had been since their last home-cooked meal until then.
They ate in silence for a few moments before she cleared their plates away and went back inside again with them while he waited for her to come back outside again so they could walk back into town together again instead of having to drive separately now that they were home instead of being away on business or somewhere else like they used to do when they were younger.
""Have you always lived here?"" He asked when she came out of the house again with their empty plates in hand this time instead of leaving them out in the yard for someone else to find later.
""No,"" she said as she sat down next to him on one side of the table instead of across from him this time like they had been doing every time they ate together before they left Ireland all those years ago together today instead. ""I lived here for a while after I got married but then I moved back here after I divorced my first husband."" She paused for a few moments before shrugging slightly as she looked up at him with a smile on her face once more. ""I've never lived here before.""",1281,-1.1559846608726303,-1.0438655413110982,-0.4032975451320618,-0.5274288146459415,-1.2576681841354604
74,R_2SfpXaDupur3YSr,MOR_HOR_1,Horror,Morpho,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a woman's face but it wasn't mine. The face had a long, thin nose, red lips and dark eyes. She looked familiar but I couldn't place her. I looked back into the mirror and saw a white hand on the side of the glass, holding on to the frame.
""What do you want?"" I asked.
""I want to be loved,"" it said.
""Who are you?"" I asked, and then I realized I heard that voice before. It was my voice.
""My name is Sarah, Sarah Taylor,"" she said.
""Sarah? Is that your real name?"" I asked her.
""Yes.""
""Why are you here? What do you want?""
Sarah was silent for a minute.
""I'm here for you,"" she finally said.
""What do you mean?"" I asked.
""I'm here for you,"" she repeated.
""How did you get in here?"" I asked.
""I broke in,"" she said with a laugh.
""What do you mean?""
""I'm here for you,"" she said again as she pulled her hand away from the mirror and disappeared.
And just as she disappeared, so did the mirror. I was left in the dark room with nothing but my thoughts. I thought about what Sarah said and realized that she was right. I did need someone to love me. Maybe she was right after all. The way she said it sounded like she was trying to be honest with me. Maybe I could take a chance with her. It might be worth it if I did love her back.
I opened the door and walked out of the bedroom and down the stairs to see who else was in the house. As I turned the corner to the kitchen, my mom came running out of the closet with a knife in her hand and a look on her face that made me drop to my knees right away.
""Mom? What's going on?"" I asked her as my hands went to my stomach and I looked down at myself to see blood dripping from my hand onto the floor.
""Get the hell out of here!"" she said as she stepped toward me with her knife still pointed at me. ""Get out now!""
I backed away from her as quickly as I could and ran into the living room where Sarah stood by the front door with her hands up in the air.
""I don't want to hurt you,"" she said as she looked at me through the glass of the front door. ""I just want to let you know that everything is going to be okay.""
I looked over at my mom who stood by the kitchen door with her hands still on the handle and a look on her face that made me want to scream for help right away. A part of me wanted to scream, but another part of me wanted to know what she wanted first before I did anything else.
""Why are you doing this?"" I asked her as I walked toward her slowly and watched as my mom stepped back a little bit from me and gripped the handle even tighter with one hand while holding the knife in the other hand tighter than ever before. ""Why are you doing this?""
""I have to protect myself,"" she said as she looked into my eyes with a piercing stare through the glass of the door. ""It's not your fault, but if you stay here, you're going to die.""
""What do you mean?"" I asked, but then she opened the door and stepped aside so that Sarah could grab my arm and pull me outside with her as she ran down the front steps of our house and onto our front lawn where we both stopped and stared at each other for a moment in silence as my mom stood behind us with her eyes wide open and a look of horror on her face as if we were all caught up in some kind of nightmare that we couldn't wake up from.
Sarah took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly as she looked at me through the glass of the door and then at my mom who stood behind us with her hands still on the handle as if she was frozen in time while we all waited for something horrible to happen that we never expected to happen at all. Her eyes turned into deep blue pools of water as they stared at me while we waited for something terrible to happen that we never thought would happen at all.
""I'm sorry,"" Sarah said as she looked into my eyes, ""but it's going to be okay."" And then just like that, Sarah turned around and started running down our street as fast as she could until I couldn't see her anymore. And then just like that, my life changed forever before it all ended before it even started.

He stared at her, unable to speak for a moment. Then he shook his head. ""That's not possible,"" he said.
""Why not? I love you and you love me, and that makes us married. If we want to be married, there is nothing that will keep us apart. Not even an ocean.""
He shook his head again. ""I'm not coming back, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that you are here, and that you know how I feel about you.""
She took his hand. ""I know, and I love you too."" She looked down and said quietly, ""And I hope that you won't die.""
""I'm afraid I will,"" he said. ""But that doesn't matter. Nothing can change what we feel for each other."" He kissed her again, and this time he didn't let her pull away. When he finally did, they were both breathing hard.
""Will you take my hand?"" he asked. She nodded. They walked together down the street, holding hands, and he felt happy and safe for the first time since he was a child.",1199,-0.3126622871770929,0.33557082113959885,0.6520366405297863,-0.6698056985835689,-1.2535331107129946
76,R_3LjSWqfo3Noe64s,ALL_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I had spent most of yesterday helping my friend and former colleague, Professor Matsuoka, get settled in with his new team of researchers, but now I was back home to grab lunch before heading back to the lab.
The day was still warm and dry, as it often is here in summer on the planet. I took a seat at one of the tables outside of a small food stall near the university's main entrance, where students were buying their lunches and chatting about their plans for the long weekend. As I waited for my order, I noticed Dr. Sato watching me from across the street with a curious expression on her face. I waved and smiled at her as she approached, but she seemed hesitant to talk to me.
""Are you busy right now?"" she asked when she reached me. ""I know we're not supposed to talk during our breaks, but I thought maybe there was something else I could do for you.""
I looked at her carefully, noticing that her hands were shaking slightly. I'd been working with Dr. Sato for over five years now, and I knew that she was always very careful with what she said around other people, especially those she didn't trust completely. She had been with the university for almost thirty years, and she wasn't just a colleague—she was also a close friend of mine. I was worried about her, so I decided to tell her the truth.
""Actually, Dr. Sato, I've got some good news,"" I told her, handing her the envelope. ""There's a job opening in my department. I think you should apply.""
She looked at the envelope in surprise and then stared at me suspiciously. ""Why are you telling me this?"" she asked. ""You don't have any reason to be nice to me right now, do you? I'm sure your boss doesn't like it if you spend time talking to me.""
""It's no big deal,"" I reassured her. ""I've just found out that the university needs someone to work in our lab on Earth. It's an assistant position, but it would be a great opportunity for you. And I thought maybe you might want to go home to Japan for a while. You've been here a long time, and I know that you miss your family and friends. I just thought...""
Dr. Sato shook her head angrily. ""I don't want to leave Mars,"" she said. ""And I'm not going to move to Earth. Not after what happened to me there. No way!""
""But the president wants us all to return to Earth for the next round of research,"" I argued. ""We have to find out why the Martians attacked our colony last year. He's planning to send the entire faculty back to Earth, so it makes sense that he'd want one of his top scientists to lead the team.""
Dr. Sato glared at me as I spoke. ""Don't talk to me about the president,"" she snapped. ""I think you should be ashamed of yourself for trying to get me to betray the trust I placed in you.""
She turned away from me and started walking quickly down the sidewalk, leaving me behind with my lunch. As she disappeared around the corner, I looked down at the envelope in my hand and frowned. The president had told me that Dr. Sato was one of the most promising young scientists on Mars, and he wanted to keep her working with him. I was sure that the job would be a great opportunity for her, but she didn't want to take it. That's when I realized why.
She had been here on Mars for almost thirty years, and she wanted to stay because she believed in the project. She loved Mars and everything it stood for—the people she worked with, the research she did, the work she was doing to make Mars a better place for future generations. And now she was going home? It wasn't fair to her, or to anyone else who cared about this place. If we were going to leave Mars, then we should do it together, not as a group of people who had nothing in common with each other.
As I sat there watching Dr. Sato disappear into the distance, I knew that I couldn't just sit back and watch her go. I had to tell her how I felt, and I had to do it right away. But where could I meet with her without raising any suspicions? I had only been home for an hour after helping Professor Matsuoka move in, and I didn't know where she would have gone already.
That's when I remembered a small café near the university where we often went to grab coffee together. The place was owned by a friend of mine named Akio, who also happened to be the best barista in all of Japan. I knew he would understand what I was going through, and I could trust him to keep our conversation private.
I walked up to the café and found Akio sitting at his usual table, sipping his coffee and reading the newspaper. He looked up as I approached and smiled warmly.
""You're late,"" he teased. ""I've been waiting here for over thirty minutes.""
I laughed and shook my head as I sat down across from him. ""Sorry,"" I said. ""I got caught up helping my colleague move into his new lab. Do you mind if I wait for a little while? I promise I won't take too long.""
Akio nodded, and we spent the next half hour talking about our favorite foods, TV shows, and movies. Finally, he sighed and pushed away from the table.
""I've got to get back to work,"" he explained. ""But I wanted to talk to you before you left today.""
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small box wrapped in shiny paper. I took it from him and opened it carefully. Inside was a silver ring, made from the same metal used on the rings that the colonists wear to mark their status. It was a symbol of the colony—the first of its kind ever created outside of Earth. And there was only one person in the colony who would ever give me a ring like this.
""Thank you, Akio,"" I whispered. ""I love you.""
Akio smiled and put his arm around my shoulder. ""I'm happy to hear that, Ken,"" he said. ""And I'm even happier to see you wearing it.""
He leaned closer and kissed me gently on the lips, and I closed my eyes as I felt his arms wrap around my waist and pull me close against him. He pulled away after just a few seconds, and we both stared at each other for a moment, smiling. Then he turned away from me and headed toward the door, leaving me alone with the ring.",1213,1.0496105357181755,1.0808498548724124,-0.20734585335669944,1.5055198639052845,1.429383321966929
78,R_1F4GbChpnieU6Qt,GEN_HOR_4,Horror,Genesis,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The face had no eyes or nose, just two large holes for its mouth and ears. It smiled at me. I screamed in fright as it vanished. I ran over to my parents' room and knocked on their door before running back here. I sat down on the edge of my bed with my knees pulled close to my chest. My heart was racing so fast that I felt like it would explode any second now.
I could only imagine what this thing wanted from me. How did it even get into our house? And why is it still here when my parents are awake? What am I going to do if they wake up and see it too? Maybe I should call the police or something. That's an option right? I picked up my phone off my nightstand and tried to dial nine-one-one but I couldn't seem to get my finger to move. I tried calling it three more times but each time the same thing happened. I looked at the screen of my phone, hoping to find something that would give me some answers but all I saw were numbers and letters.
""What's wrong?"" Sarah asked as she opened her bedroom door. ""Are you okay?""
""Yes,"" I replied, trying to sound calm. ""Just had a bad dream.""
""Me too,"" she said, walking over to my bed. She leaned against the headboard and placed her hand on my leg. ""It was pretty scary. But I'm glad you're feeling better. You know, that thing gave me the creeps.""
""Yeah,"" I replied.
She looked down at my phone and then back at me.
""Didn't you say your phone wasn't working?""
""It isn't,"" I lied.
""Maybe we can call someone else instead?""
I turned away from her and grabbed the phone. I looked at the screen again and realized my fingers weren't moving anymore either. I tried to shake them but nothing was happening. Then I remembered where I was, and how I'd gotten here. I looked around my room to make sure everything was okay. When I saw the bed not made up and the covers thrown across the floor, my stomach dropped.
""Sarah,"" I called out.
She didn't respond so I stood up and walked towards her. There was no response. I reached out and touched her shoulder. It felt cold. I quickly let go of her and backed away. Her eyes were open and staring at mine. I felt myself start to panic as I looked down at her. Something wasn't right.
""Sarah!"" I cried out again.
Her eyes rolled back into her head and she fell backwards onto the floor. I rushed over and saw her lying unconscious. I looked around frantically for anything that might help. I spotted a book on her desk. I took it and brought it over to her. I flipped through the pages and found what I needed.
""911,"" I whispered to myself.
I pressed the buttons on the side of the phone and held it up to my ear. When I heard a voice I started to scream. I hung up the phone and threw it against the wall. Tears began to fill my eyes. I turned around to look at Sarah. She was still unconscious.
The monster was gone but now I had another problem. What should I do with Sarah? Should I try to take her somewhere safe or leave her alone until morning? If I left her here, who knew what would happen to her. I didn't want to think about it. I decided to check her pulse to be sure she was alive. I lifted up her wrist and felt it, checking for a heartbeat. As soon as I touched her arm, Sarah opened her eyes. I gasped as I stood back up.
""Where did you come from?"" I asked.
""I don't know,"" she answered. ""But I promise you I won't hurt you. I came inside because I was afraid you might be in trouble.""
""You were?""
""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come in without asking.""
""No, that's not what I meant,"" I said, wiping away tears. ""How did you get in here?""
""I snuck in,"" she explained. ""I didn't want to wake you up by knocking. I thought I could find the source of the noise and fix it before anyone woke up.""
""That's really nice of you, Sarah. But I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.""
""Okay,"" she replied. ""As long as you're sure, that's good enough for me.""
After checking on Sarah, I got dressed and went downstairs. I ate breakfast while my parents watched TV. They seemed to forget about the incident last night. I finished my meal and went to my room. I decided to turn on my computer so I could finally check my email. When I logged in, I noticed a new message at the top of my inbox. I clicked on it and read it.

79,R_23fOlR8W3ieK2yA,BAS_HF_3,High Fantasy,Basic Coherence,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is where we're supposed to meet?"" asked Dara as she stared around her. ""It looks more like a ruin than anything else.""
""I don't know,"" said Alusair, frowning. ""There's something about this place that makes me feel uneasy."" She glanced back toward the road leading down into the valley. ""Maybe if you'd been able to find your way here without any trouble, I wouldn't mind so much, but since you couldn't even get past those guards…""
Dara nodded slowly. ""You may have a point there.""
They had spent the day traveling southward along the road, stopping only once for a brief rest break before continuing on. Now they were finally close enough to see what lay ahead of them. It seemed to take forever, though, because Dara kept glancing nervously over her shoulder every time she thought she heard footsteps behind them.
Alusair turned away from the road and gazed across the valley. Her eyes narrowed. ""What are you looking at?"" she demanded.
""Nothing!"" Dara replied quickly. ""Just wondering how far it is to the other side.""
She pointed toward one end of the lake. ""We'll be crossing that bridge over there. That's where the village is.""
""That's not what I'm talking about,"" Alusair snapped. ""Look at those cliffs! They go straight up, like the walls of an ancient fortress.""
Dara followed her gaze and frowned. ""Yes, they do look rather formidable. But I think they're just rocks, nothing more.""
""No,"" Alusair insisted. ""Those aren't rocks—they're buildings. And they're very old, too. Look closer; you can see cracks in the stones.""
Dara did as she was told, but still didn't see what Alusair meant. ""I don't see anything. What am I missing?""
""The walls are made of stone,"" Alusair explained patiently. ""But the roofs are covered with grass and moss. See? You can see where the moss has grown over the roof tiles. There must be some sort of magic keeping the roof intact. Otherwise, the whole thing would collapse under the weight of the snow that falls on top of it during winter.""
Dara squinted at the distant cliff wall again. ""Well, I guess you're right. Those are definitely houses up there. But why haven't they been repaired yet?""
""Because no one lives there anymore.""
""Why not?""
""Because the people who lived there died long ago.""
""How do you know?""
Alusair shrugged. ""I've seen ruins like these before. Sometimes the inhabitants of a village leave, but sometimes they die off, too. Either way, the buildings remain standing for centuries afterward. Eventually the vegetation grows over everything until there's nothing left to tell anyone that a settlement ever existed there.""
""So what happened to the people who used to live there?"" Dara asked.
Alusair smiled sadly. ""Most likely, they went somewhere else. Maybe they moved to another part of the kingdom, or maybe they went out into the world beyond our borders. Who knows? But whatever happened to them, they never came back.""
""Do you think we should go inside one of the buildings?""
Alusair shook her head. ""Probably not. We need to stay on the road, and we don't want to draw attention to ourselves. Besides, the last thing we want is to be trapped inside a building with no way out.""
Dara nodded reluctantly. ""All right, then. Let's keep moving.""
They continued down the road, which soon curved around the edge of the lake and led them toward the bridge that spanned the water. As they drew nearer, Dara saw that the bridge wasn't really a bridge at all. Instead, it was a series of wooden platforms strung between the two towers. Each platform was large enough to accommodate several men walking abreast, and there were numerous ropes tied to posts set into the ground on both sides. It looked precarious to Dara, but Alusair assured her that the bridges were sturdy enough to support a wagon loaded with cargo.
As they neared the bridge, Dara spotted a group of men working on the far side. They were carrying baskets full of supplies over to the other side of the river, where they would be unloaded and carried into the village.
""I wonder if they're going to the same place we are,"" Dara mused aloud.
""If they are, they're probably heading to the inn,"" Alusair replied. ""It's the only building in the village that seems to be occupied.""
""Maybe they're merchants,"" suggested Dara. ""Or maybe they're travelers passing through on their way to someplace else.""
""Either way, we shouldn't try to talk to them,"" warned Alusair. ""We don't know anything about them, and they might not welcome visitors.""
""Right."" Dara nodded. ""Let's just keep moving.""
When they reached the bridge, Dara paused for a moment to study the arrangement of the platforms. The first platform was closest to the road, and the next was placed farther back. After that, each successive platform was positioned further away from the one beneath it.
""How come they're arranged like that?"" she asked. ""Is there some kind of pattern?""
""It's not a pattern,"" Alusair replied. ""Each platform is placed in such a way as to provide a clear view of the road, while also providing a path for wagons coming down the road.""
Dara nodded. ""I see. So the bridge isn't actually a bridge at all. It's a series of walkways.""
""Exactly.""
""And the ropes are there to help people cross the river?""
""Yes. If you tie a rope to a post on either side of the river, you can use it to pull yourself across.""
Dara frowned. ""But why bother using ropes? Wouldn't it be easier to build a bridge?""
""Not necessarily,"" Alusair answered. ""A bridge needs to be strong enough to withstand the weight of a heavy wagon. That means it has to be built out of stone. But the bridges we're seeing now are made of wood. Even if they weren't, they'd still be much cheaper to maintain than a stone bridge. Plus, they don't require as many workers to construct.""
""I suppose that makes sense,"" Dara agreed.
""Now let's get started,"" Alusair said. ""We don't want to keep the others waiting.""
Dara followed her sister onto the bridge, and they began making their way across. When they reached the middle, Alusair stopped and turned to face Dara. ""Remember what I told you about keeping quiet?"" she reminded her.
""Of course.""

80,R_3fQbUYZkN6DeLhD,GEN_HR_6,Historical Romance,Genesis,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He didn't know she could sing until she started to. It had been a good voice, soft but sweet with just a touch of wistfulness, and it seemed as if she were singing for herself rather than the crowd. When he realized that, though, he couldn't help but listen.
He looked up from wiping down the table he'd been cleaning when she left, only to find himself staring after her. The woman who had taken her seat hadn't really interested him before; now he thought about her all the time. Her name was Elenor, and she was beautiful in an odd way. His friends teased him mercilessly because of it. ""If you're going to make me look at your new girl, then I want something out of it,"" they said. And what did he get? Nothing! They never paid any attention to her!
It wasn't fair. He knew she was beautiful. She wore her long hair loose around her shoulders, and often her dark locks fell across her face so that it looked as if she was wearing a veil. There was no other color in her dress or jewelry—just black—and yet, somehow it suited her. But he didn't care how pretty she was. What mattered was that she sang beautifully.
When the tavern closed, he went home. He liked being alone. People would ask questions and try to make conversation with him at times, when he was working, and the answers he gave them irritated him. Now, though, he felt more relaxed. At least, until he opened the door to his room. Then he found her there, waiting for him.
""I've been waiting for you,"" she said softly.
She was standing by the bed, her back turned to him. As she spoke, she slowly rolled up the sleeves of her gown. The fine fabric was made of silk, and it shimmered in the candlelight. He stared at the hard muscles of her arms, wanting to reach out and stroke them. Instead, he stepped forward and took hold of her arm.
""What are you doing?"" he asked.
Her voice was low and husky, and it sent a thrill through him. ""Why don't you put down that crossbow and take off those clothes?""
She laughed, and he heard the sound in his ears. ""Oh, you'll be sorry,"" she said. ""You should have stayed away.""
He pulled her toward him. ""Don't play games with me,"" he said. ""I won't stand for it.""
She leaned against him, pressing her body tightly against his. Her breasts were warm against his chest, and he felt their softness. He lifted her from the ground and threw her onto the bed. She gasped as she landed, and he followed her down.
""I'm not playing any games,"" she whispered. Her hands stroked his chest, and he groaned as she moved even closer to him.
His trousers were still on, but he tore them open and slid his hand inside her dress. She moaned, and he pressed himself against her. He wanted to feel her wetness between them. He needed to feel it.
Elenor's hands pushed at his shoulders, trying to push him away. ""No,"" she said. ""Not here!""
But he would have none of it. He pushed her legs apart and thrust into her, hard.
""Stop!"" she cried out. ""We can't do this here! Not like this! You shouldn't even touch me!""
He pulled out of her and grabbed her hands. ""This is how we're going to do it,"" he said. ""And you're going to love it. Just you wait and see.""
He forced her to lie on the bed and covered her with a blanket. She was shaking, but she didn't try to escape. Her eyes were wide, and she breathed heavily.
""There now,"" he said. ""That wasn't so bad, was it?""
She shook her head.
He lay beside her. She was trembling, and he could hear her breathing. ""Are you scared?"" he asked.
She nodded.
He kissed her cheek. ""Then why don't you go to sleep?""
He felt her tense. She tried to move away, but he stopped her. ""I won't hurt you,"" he said. ""Trust me, I wouldn't dream of it.""
She closed her eyes. ""Please,"" she whispered. ""Let me rest.""
He held her close and waited until she slept. Only then did he let her go.
As soon as she woke, she dressed quickly and ran from the house. She didn't stop running until she reached the woods. There, she cried for hours.
After that, he watched her every night. He spent most of his days in the tavern, drinking and singing. Everyone said he was a fool, but he didn't care.
At first, he thought she might leave again. But then she began coming to the tavern each evening, and he knew she was staying. Her eyes were always wide with fear, and he knew she feared him. He didn't care. He didn't even know why he kept watching her. Was it to remind her of what he would do if she ever tried to run? If that was it, then he was right to keep his promise.
But then she smiled at him. He almost dropped the tray of ale he was carrying. For the first time since he'd met her, she actually seemed happy.
Elenor went to the tavern each day. She didn't talk to anyone, but she listened to the songs the men sang. Sometimes they would tell jokes about her, and she laughed along with them.
It was another three weeks before she dared speak to him. He was leaning on the bar, and she came up behind him. She spoke softly, and he couldn't understand what she was saying. But then she gripped his arm and squeezed. Her fingers were cold.
""What?"" he asked.
""They're gone!"" she said. ""My parents, they're dead!""
""I'm sorry,"" he replied.
""Where are they?"" she asked. ""Didn't you kill them?""
He shook his head. ""I told you I didn't hurt them. Why do you think that?""
""I don't know,"" she said. ""I guess I thought you were like them. Like him.""
""Who?"" he asked. ""Your husband?""
She nodded, and he sighed. ""He was a terrible man. He beat me, and threatened to kill my mother and father if I ever told them what he was doing.",1089,-0.5191126620521176,-1.1408944526120939,1.1900881914640924,0.6882655696879333,0.5245592545890994
81,R_2bOFPjCNpkp2EZ9,GEN_HOR_6,Horror,Genesis,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. My own, but not my face. The body had been cut in half with one arm dangling off the side of the mirror. It was bloodied and pale white. It smiled at me as if to say ""hello.""
""I'm dead,"" I said, and then I passed out.
When I awoke, I found myself sitting on the floor in front of the bathroom sink. Looking into the mirror now, I saw that it was just an ordinary mirror. There were no more people or monsters staring back at me. Instead, I saw a reflection of myself wearing black jeans and an old t-shirt. I stood up and brushed myself off before walking towards the door.
I opened it to see a man standing there. He was tall with dark hair, a goatee, and piercing green eyes. His shirt was torn open to reveal his bare chest. He grabbed my shoulder and spun me around. A second later, he was knocked unconscious by something falling onto him.
I turned around and saw another man lying on the ground. This time, he didn't look quite human. He was pale as a ghost with a sharp, angular jawline. One eye was covered in gauze while the other one was completely shut. He was clutching at his stomach and moaning in pain.
I ran over to him and pulled my phone out of my pocket. I pressed call button, but nothing happened. The screen remained blank. The man's breath was becoming more labored and his eyelids began fluttering. I panicked and tried to dial 911, but the same thing happened. I tried opening my browser and hitting refresh, but still nothing. Then, I remembered what the woman in the diner said about being in a place where the internet doesn't work.
I went over to the man who fell asleep and touched his wrist. He came to suddenly and clutched at the wound on his stomach. I took my car keys out of my pocket and gave them to him. He put them into his mouth and started chewing on them. Then, he pointed behind me and made a strange noise. I turned around to find two more men standing in the doorway. They were both holding guns and looked very angry.
""You want some too?"" I asked.
The man with the bandaged eye let out a loud scream and pointed his gun right at me. I stepped away from the man and raised my hands. The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye did the same.
""What is going on here?"" I asked.
""Who are you?"" one of the men replied.
""I'm a friend of the lady you guys attacked in the diner.""
""Just stay down for a minute and we'll get answers out of you,"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said.
""Okay,"" I said.
He pointed his gun at me and pushed me backwards against the wall. I didn't fight back. I just waited for whatever they wanted to do. The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye reached into his pocket and pulled out a small knife. He quickly sliced through the rope that was tying my wrists together. I rubbed my wrists where the ropes had dug into them so deeply.
""Why would they attack her?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye asked.
""I don't know,"" I answered. ""But I think she has some sort of connection to what's happening around here. She seemed surprised when I told her about my brother. That's why we were there.""
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye held up his hand and made a fist. A moment later, I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. Then, I felt my neck being twisted as hard as I could stand.
""What the hell?"" I screamed.
I tried to turn around, but the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye pushed me back against the wall. He leaned down and placed his ear next to my mouth.
""Not so loud,"" he whispered.
I nodded and he released me. I turned around to see the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye pointing his gun at me again.
""I don't have any answers,"" I said. ""I haven't seen anything like this before either. I can't help you.""
""There's a room upstairs,"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said. ""We'll take care of things there.""
I looked up to see two more men coming up the stairs. They were dressed in black suits and carried large guns in their hands.
""Do what you need to do,"" I said.
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye reached into his pocket once again and took out a small bottle. He unscrewed the lid and sprayed some liquid on my face. Then, he picked up the man who was tied up in the corner and threw him at the wall. The man bounced off the wall and slid to the floor. He groaned in pain as he tried to get up.
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye dropped the empty bottle and pulled out a small syringe. He jabbed it into the man's stomach and then injected something into his veins. The man's skin became red and blotchy and he began bleeding from his nose.
""So, what's your name?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye asked.
""I'm Michael,"" I said.
""Michael, huh?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said. ""Well, Michael, I guess you're our prisoner for now. We'll be back to talk to you soon enough.""
They all left the room and closed the door behind themselves. I ran over to the fallen man and saw that he was shaking. I helped him up and led him into the bathroom. I washed his face and cleaned the blood from his arms and chest. Then, I sat him down on the toilet and gave him water to drink. After he finished drinking, I wiped his lips clean and removed the gauze wrapped around his eye. It was red and swollen. I pressed my fingers against the wound and he cried out in pain.
""It hurts,"" he said.
""Sorry,"" I said. ""Let me see what I can do to help you.""
I carefully removed the bandage and saw that the skin underneath was very raw and inflamed. The area around the wound had turned bright purple. There was also a large lump sticking out of his cheek.
""Oh, God,"" I said. ""Are you okay?""
""I'll be fine,"" he said. ""It will heal eventually.""
I sat down next to him and rubbed his back. He closed his eyes and sighed.
""I hate needles,"" he said. ""That was the worst pain I've ever felt.""
""I'm sorry,"" I said.
He chuckled and leaned his head on my shoulder.",1199,-1.25060814134705,-1.030290115571937,0.4701440206759487,-1.5414083284064248,-1.0665981345185804
82,R_2D5K8exl6UpCEuR,OUR_HF_6,High Fantasy,Ouroboros,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It's beautiful here,"" she said after a moment. ""I can't imagine what kind of monsters lurk around these parts."" She shuddered slightly. ""Or even worse, the humans who might take us hostage or do something worse than that.""
""If anyone took you hostage, they'd regret it,"" he said.
She chuckled at that. ""What? You would kill them?""
""You've seen me in action. I'm an orc, after all."" He gave her a grin. ""Don't worry, my little human friend, I'll protect you.""
He let his gaze wander over the peaceful scene. A cool breeze blew past him, stirring the wisps of hair that had escaped from his braid.
""If the town is deserted, does that mean we have to build our own shelter?"" she asked.
He shook his head. ""That was my hope, though if there are other orcs around, I doubt any of us would mind sharing.""
""There isn't anyone else here?""
""Not yet. Not in any large numbers anyway. The ores and the humans must still be fighting somewhere else.""
She nodded and then looked back up at the sky.
""It looks like it will rain soon,"" he told her.
""Oh no. It would be such a shame to have this perfect weather ruined by a storm.""
He laughed at that. ""And what does 'perfect' mean to you?""
Her eyes widened. ""I don't know. That's a good question. Perfect for me would probably be—""
""Peace? Calm?"" He cocked his head. ""Disease-free?""
""Yes, yes, those things,"" she said and sighed. ""But I suppose perfect could also mean something like—I don't know—the absence of pain."" She rubbed the side of her face where the wound still ached. ""You can have peace or you can have perfect, but never both at once. There will always be pain.""
He shook his head. ""That's a terrible outlook on life, don't you think? What is the point of living if all you do is hurt?""
""You're not supposed to ask such questions to orcs,"" she said and smiled weakly. ""But I guess that answers your question anyway. Humans are always looking for the perfect answer. You could get hit by lightning, catch an infection from some unknown virus and die."" She glanced over at him. ""Or worse. Maybe even a human could be the reason you got hurt. It could be some asshole in a city who decides to punch you out.""
""What about orcs?"" he asked.
She shook her head. ""We can't live forever, though I hear our kind doesn't have to fear diseases so much as we did in the past. But, yeah, that's all just a part of the cycle of life. Nothing to be afraid of, nothing to be desired.""
He nodded and gave a small smile.
""Is this what being in love is like?"" she asked.
His smile faded. ""I don't know."" He looked around the area again. ""If there's no one else here, I'm guessing we'll be the only ones for a while. Unless some ores or humans are already holed up somewhere nearby.""
""So where are they?""
He shrugged. ""Who knows? We can take shelter in the village, if you want, but there might not be anything useful inside it. I could gather some firewood to start a small campfire, though.""
""That would be wonderful.""
They made their way towards the buildings and the trees.
""Are you sure about this?"" she asked. ""You know we're going to get into trouble if anyone finds us.""
""The more trouble we cause, the better, right?"" He flashed her a grin. ""This is a good chance for us to be a bit more dangerous.""
""True,"" she said with a nod. ""Maybe we should kill them.""
He laughed again. ""Don't worry about that. Let's just gather some wood. This looks like the right place for it.""
""That's a relief to hear. I didn't know you had so much restraint.""
""It comes from growing up on a farm. My father was a very hard man. We had to respect him, or else he would make our lives difficult. The same goes for my brothers and sisters. If they thought we were too loud or rambunctious, my mother would give us a beating.""
She looked over at him again. ""I don't think I ever heard your parents' names.""
""They died in a fire when I was only five years old.""
""Oh, I'm sorry."" She frowned slightly. ""How did it happen?""
""I think someone broke in and set the whole house on fire. There wasn't any warning—we were all asleep inside, and then suddenly we were waking up with smoke all around us. My father tried to save my mother, but he couldn't because the flames were too hot. He died saving her.""
""That must have been horrible.""
""Yes, it was."" He nodded and put his hand on top of hers as they walked.
""Why don't you tell me about them instead?"" she suggested. ""Who were they and what kind of people were they?""
""My father was named Tristan and my mother's name was Serena.""
""Were you close to them?""
He chuckled. ""Not really. They were always angry at me. My father never wanted anything to do with me except to yell at me, and my mother was the same way. I don't know if they were jealous because I had so many siblings who came after me, but I'm sure they were. I only wish I could have known them better. My memories are hazy, but I can still hear their voices in my mind.""
She squeezed his hand, which made him smile. ""You didn't have an easy life.""
""No,"" he replied. ""I didn't.""
The rain started a short time later, and it grew louder and heavier with each passing minute. It seemed like the whole sky was crying in response to the emotional state of the people around them. He let go of her hand and looked out into the woods for a moment.
""I think the village is that way,"" he said and pointed. ""Let's get the wood first.""
She nodded and started walking toward the place where the firewood was piled. She grabbed handfuls of the branches and stacked them neatly along one side of the dirt road.",1110,-0.015699988592754323,-0.44337382028608646,-1.5111573857242353,-0.2294462354415453,-0.20696152914037652
83,R_z6fEvWbazP8JLKp,LOW_HSF_7,Hard Sci-Fi,Low Rider,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I looked down at the message. President Tregesser had been kind enough to let me know in advance that he wanted to see me so that I wouldn't be late or miss it.
When I got back home, I changed into something more casual, grabbed a book, and headed straight for the café next door to do some reading. There wasn't much else for me to do right then, other than get caught up with all my work, since it would just end up piling up again if I left everything until later. As I read and drank, though, the thought nagged at me that the president might not be calling just to check in about the progress of my research project. That made me nervous because I didn't like to think that someone higher up than Dr. Sato might want to take over my work, especially when he hadn't even seen any results yet.
A few minutes after finishing lunch, I went across the street to the administration building. The lobby was quiet except for the sound of a few people talking softly as they waited to talk to the receptionist. As soon as I walked through the front doors, a voice called out to me. ""You're late, Omi!""
""I'm sorry, Captain Rho, but I was just finishing my lunch first."" She laughed. ""I hope I didn't keep you waiting. Did the president send word where he wants us?""
Rho glanced over his shoulder at the open doorway leading to the offices upstairs, then turned back to look at me. ""He did indeed. Follow me."" We entered the elevator and started climbing. After a minute, the doors slid open, and Rho led us through a long hall lined with glass doors to the large, circular room directly ahead of us. A pair of men in uniform were standing behind a podium there, one reading something off a small screen and the other looking bored as he checked his watch every five seconds. They looked up at the sound of our footsteps, then saluted. Captain Rho waved for them to go ahead of us, which they quickly did. I wondered what was going on until the president emerged from an adjoining office. He was still in his suit and tie, although he'd taken off his shoes and rolled up his sleeves. When he saw us coming, he smiled and waved us forward.
The room was filled with people sitting at long tables. Most of them wore civilian clothes rather than the standard issue suits worn by the military and government staff. Some of them looked familiar. Others seemed to be visitors from another country who'd come for a tour of the facilities here on the surface. A couple of scientists I knew were also present. The president approached each of them as we entered, shaking their hands and introducing himself. Then he turned to me, gave me a quick nod, and asked, ""So, how are things progressing with your investigation?""
I looked over at Rho. ""Sir, I don't have any results yet.""
""And is it my understanding that Dr. Sato is doing most of the work on your research project right now?""
I nodded. ""Yes sir, she has been working hard to analyze the data and find answers, but so far we haven't gotten anywhere.""
Tregesser shook his head sadly. ""This isn't what I expected,"" he said, turning away for a moment to speak to someone sitting at another table. A few moments passed before he turned back to us again. ""We've decided to transfer you to a new assignment,"" he said as he walked back toward us. ""It will take some time for you to get settled in at your new facility, but Dr. Sato will be able to continue on with your investigation, albeit under the supervision of her supervisor there. I expect you'll begin work at the end of this week or early next at the latest.""
I looked over at Rho to see how she felt about this change in plans. Her mouth opened a little bit, but no words came out. Finally, she managed to say, ""I'm not sure I understand exactly what's happening here.""
""I'll explain it to you as best I can,"" replied the president. ""After speaking with Dr. Sato and hearing that you two were becoming increasingly frustrated with the slow progress of your investigations, I suggested to Dr. Sato that we reassign your project so that you could both devote more of your attention to another one that we've recently become aware of. It should help speed up the process and hopefully yield better results sooner.""
""What do you mean?"" I asked.
He looked at Rho before replying. ""I want to assign Dr. Sato to investigate a different area of research here on the planet. This one has been on my radar for quite some time, and we have reason to believe it may hold a key to some of the mysteries surrounding the colonization of Mars. Your current assignment was originally intended to provide us with the data that would allow us to proceed with a full investigation, but after speaking with Dr. Sato earlier today, I've come to realize that perhaps we need to take a different approach to solving this particular mystery.""
He paused, letting his words sink in before continuing. ""Dr. Sato will be assigned to work on an entirely different project from yours at the research center near Olympus Mons. I know this will make it harder for you to access the equipment necessary to complete your current assignment, but I hope that once Dr. Sato is done with her new investigation she'll be willing to share what she learns with you.""
""I don't see why not,"" replied Rho. ""If it turns out that our work helps solve whatever problem we're trying to address here, I'm sure Dr. Sato will be happy to let you have a look at the data she gathers. And if not, I won't feel too bad about it, knowing that I'm working on something important for everyone involved.""
""Well, that certainly makes sense,"" agreed the president. He looked over at me. ""You're welcome to attend any meetings related to the investigation Dr. Sato begins, and I'll try to give you enough notice before any big discoveries are made so that you'll be able to join us. In the meantime, I want you to focus on your project there. Once you finish it, I want to review all the data together before we discuss any further assignments for either of you. Is that acceptable to both of you?""
Both Rho and I nodded enthusiastically. ""Of course, Mr. President,"" Rho said.
The president turned to Dr. Sato and spoke again, ""As for you, please accept my apologies for having to reassign your project to someone else. I wish Dr. Rho were more skilled in the field of physics so that she could continue investigating the data you've gathered here on Mars, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to be the case. I trust you'll forgive my insensitivity in asking you to move onto something different.""
Sato shook her head. ""I appreciate the thoughtfulness you've shown in considering me for this assignment, but I must decline. My work with this project has been very fulfilling thus far and has allowed me to learn more about how science works at a deeper level than I ever expected.",1303,0.8058674005516993,-0.0643886302810128,0.6194602763203584,0.29967064651244407,0.6724252241236414
84,R_3oI6T9Db0uK5uqk,FAN_HR_9,Historical Romance,Fandango,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her blond hair caught the light, glowed silver; the sunlight made her blue eyes burn with fire. Her cheeks were pale but flushed from the cool breeze that blew through the tavern. He could hardly believe the sight of her. All his life, he'd dreamed of meeting someone as beautiful and striking as her and she had walked right into his life—she had to be a dream come true. The way she looked back at him, so confident, so sure of herself…
He knew in an instant she would be the love of his life. But what did he say? His tongue froze in his mouth. His thoughts went blank. All he could think about was how pretty she was, how much he wanted to see her again, to hold her hand, touch her cheek, kiss her.
He watched her leave without saying a word. What could he have said? How could he have asked her for her name when his mind was blank as a sheet of paper? But she didn't seem offended by his silence. She gave him a small smile and left the tavern. For some reason, it struck him as being all too familiar somehow. As if he'd seen her somewhere before. And then the penny dropped—the smile, the way she held her head high as she left the building… it reminded him of another girl who'd stood in front of him not so long ago. Someone he didn't know very well. But she had been gorgeous in every way, just as this woman was, and there was no question about the way he felt about her—his whole body had tingled from her presence and from her smile. He had wanted to see more of her.
As soon as he left the tavern, he ran home as fast as his legs would carry him. There was nothing he loved more than thinking about the mystery woman's golden hair, the color of sunlit wheat. He couldn't wait to tell his friends that a stranger had looked at him, smiled at him in such a special way. That she'd caught his eye and held it—he'd never forget the first day he saw her. Not for as long as he lived. He would tell them everything, how happy she'd made him feel, how lucky he was to be alive. They would laugh, but they would understand. Because he had always wanted someone to look at him with eyes so bright and eyes that burned with fire.
The next day he woke up early, ate a quick breakfast, and hurried to the tavern. When he stepped inside, the girl was already there. The air crackled with the electricity between them, but he couldn't bring himself to speak to her.
""What can I get you?"" he asked mechanically.
She smiled again and ordered a beer. ""Where are your parents?"" he blurted out, suddenly unable to contain himself.
She leaned forward and lowered her voice. ""They're dead.""
He was speechless.
The girl seemed to sense he needed answers to questions that weren't ready to be put into words. She nodded toward the window. ""Come outside with me for a minute,"" she said softly.
Outside, away from prying ears, he felt the tension in her shoulders ease.
""My parents and everyone else died in an accident four years ago. I'm only fourteen, but I have to take care of myself now. I'm working here because my father used to. It's hard work."" The corner of her mouth curved slightly upward, as if there was something she wasn't telling him.
""I am so sorry,"" he said, thinking that nothing could be worse than having your parents die. ""When did it happen?""
She shook her head. ""That doesn't matter.""
He tried to think of something he could say to comfort her, but no words came to him. He looked around for a way to start a conversation, trying not to stare at her, but he couldn't tear his gaze away from her face. Her lips parted in a slight smile, and her eyes looked sad. He wanted to know why, but there was no way to ask her.
""You were in the tavern yesterday,"" he blurted out in a desperate attempt to fill the silence. ""You sat in front of me."" He thought of the girl from yesterday and the smile she'd given him. It seemed like ages ago now. ""You came in while I was working. You smiled at me and then… and then…""
The girl looked at him sharply. ""What does that mean?""
He couldn't believe he was saying these words to her, in front of witnesses, and he knew from her expression that she was surprised as well. His heart started pounding hard.
He took a deep breath. ""That means I think I saw you before, four years ago. At an inn. It was dark, but I remember your hair… the color of sunlight…""
Her expression turned guarded, cautious.
""I can't explain it,"" he said, shaking his head. ""It was a dream, and then I woke up and realized that I was seeing things. I don't know if it really happened. But when I talked to you yesterday, I knew right away it was true.""
The girl gazed at him carefully. Her eyes were so blue, so bright; her skin was so white. Her hair looked like spun gold.
""You mean you've seen me somewhere else before?"" she asked quietly.
""Yes, I know it sounds crazy, but…""
""Don't call me by name."" She looked away.
He took a deep breath. His pulse was so loud in his head it was like thunder rumbling in the distance. This was happening, he realized, or maybe it was a dream—but he'd dreamed of her before, too. It was a recurring nightmare. There were so many things he wanted to ask her, so many questions, but the way she looked at him, like he'd done something wrong and was making her angry, made him hesitate. His face heated up. How could he have forgotten the proper response when he met a woman for the first time? Was there such a thing as a perfect gentleman anymore? He didn't seem to be one.
The girl's eyes seemed to bore into him. The blue of her gaze felt like ice. His heart sank. What should he do? He knew she was upset, but what could he say? Would she even listen to him? He was no good at this sort of thing.
She cleared her throat. ""I don't know what to say,"" he mumbled.
""You should go,"" she said.
""But—""
""Leave me alone.""
He felt like crying. He wanted to tell her that none of that mattered, that the way she looked at him when she left yesterday was unforgettable—that he'd been dreaming about her ever since. But he couldn't find the words. He was too embarrassed to say anything at all.
""Do you want a beer?"" he heard himself ask instead, and then he left the tavern.
He waited until evening, hoping she would come in again, but she didn't.
Two days later, he saw her standing on the street outside the tavern. She was talking to him, laughing.
He felt relieved for a moment—until she looked back at him and frowned.",1251,-0.46897472603968676,-0.5562850124716718,-1.0840218114681612,-1.8916007101462446,-0.6134292405936355
85,R_31c2N7wpvIzXOO1,LOW_HOR_4,Horror,Low Rider,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The man's mouth moved as if he were about to say something. Then another head popped through the mirror.
""Help,"" said the second person in my dream. ""You have to help us."" It had been three days since I met them. They hadn't told me their names or where they were staying; only that I was to follow them wherever they went so I could help save a life. They wouldn't tell me any more than that, but when you see someone die in front of you like I did, you can never forget it. That's what happened last night. A guy came running down the street toward an alley and stopped right before he turned around to look at something behind him. In an instant, he ran straight into one of those monsters that you sometimes see out at night. Before I knew it, everything had disappeared except for blood splattering across the concrete. It all happened so fast. I was frozen with fear. My hands were shaking so much that I dropped the flashlight that was strapped to my waist. It hit the ground hard and cracked.
""What is happening?"" I asked myself. I didn't know who the people were. How do you know somebody just by seeing their face? Maybe they're friends of mine and they've come here looking for me.
The next morning, I found the flashlight. Someone must have picked it up and brought it back to me. It was still broken and no longer worked. I left it lying on the floor. Then, I started thinking maybe I should leave town for awhile and find somewhere else to live. But, that's not easy for me because of my mother. She needs someone around to take care of her, but she also has a habit of getting herself into trouble. I guess you could say I'm always stuck between two bad decisions.
When I got home, I heard the TV turn on. Mom was already awake and watching it in the living room. I put my bag down next to the couch and took off my shoes while trying to catch the sound of what she was watching. I couldn't get any information from the static. Finally, it came clear that it was a news report about the monster attacks. The anchorwoman talked about how a woman had survived the attack and was being treated at the hospital now.
My mom turned off the TV. ""Did you hear?"" she asked. ""It's all over the news. A group of students got attacked by the monsters. One of them managed to run away. We're lucky that this lady came back alive.""
""What?"" I asked her. ""What are you talking about?""
Mom stood up, opened the refrigerator, and took out a carton of milk. ""I read it in the newspaper today. There was an article in the paper about it. This girl was walking down the street near school when these things appeared out of nowhere. She saw them coming at her, but they were moving so fast that she wasn't able to outrun them. They caught up to her and dragged her into an alley. She fought them as best she could until she lost consciousness, then they finished her off.""
That really scared me, but I didn't say anything back. What would I say? How does a daughter respond to news like that? All I could do was think of how she could have survived. How did she get away? Did she kill one or more of them before getting away?
""They're hunting people, Mom,"" I said. ""People don't go missing every day without some sort of reason.""
""Maybe they got sick from eating bad food,"" she offered. ""Some of those kids might be sickly and weak from malnutrition.""
""No,"" I answered. ""These weren't normal people. These things aren't human, and they shouldn't even be allowed to live. They shouldn't be here in our world. They should just disappear into the darkness and be forgotten. The government should do whatever it takes to get rid of them. They shouldn't be allowed to keep attacking innocent civilians!""
""You sound crazy, dear,"" my mom said. ""There's nothing we can do about it. You don't need to worry about it, okay?""
I tried telling her the truth. If there's anyone who would believe me, it would be Mom. Unfortunately, she wasn't going to listen unless there was proof. And I couldn't provide it. I had no way of proving that monsters really existed. So, I kept quiet instead of arguing back and just walked upstairs to my bedroom. I closed the door behind me and went over to my desk and sat down in front of my computer, which was connected wirelessly to my TV set. I opened my web browser and typed in the address for the website called Monster-Earth.org.
It took about five minutes before the screen displayed. On it was a huge image of an alien looking creature, its eyes shining brightly beneath black holes with white rings circling around them. The image was so large that I wondered if it was a picture taken from outer space and zoomed in on this planet for us to see. There was no title on the image, but there was a message below it that read: ""This is what you'll see if you go to your nearest monster attack location, so keep your eyes open and be careful!"" The message ended with a link to the site's homepage.
I clicked on it and began reading through the contents of the website. Some parts were written in English, while other parts were in different languages. I figured the author probably wanted to spread his information to as many people around the globe as possible, so they could all learn about what was happening. The more people who were informed, the better chances they would have at surviving an attack. It was almost like a game of survival, and if you wanted to make it all the way to the end of this journey, you needed to be prepared. That meant knowing exactly what to do, and being aware of everything around you. That was why the website contained such detailed information. It was designed to teach people how to survive a monster attack and how to protect themselves against them, so the people living near each attack location would know exactly how to avoid being attacked. The author didn't want anyone to get hurt or killed. He made sure everyone knew that monsters weren't dangerous. They just wanted to live their lives peacefully and without hurting others. That was their main goal. Monsters only ever attacked humans who were doing harm to others in the same way that humans did when they harmed one another. That was it. If you stayed out of their way, they'd stay out of yours. It was that simple. But, unfortunately, most people didn't understand the difference between a monster and a human, so the author wanted to explain it to them.
The author of Monster-Earth was a man named Dr. Thomas H.",1238,0.8222525141696573,0.4452626300531973,0.6152389195674692,0.32979775647521953,-0.9618707484881445

She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The moment she sat down, he knew he was in trouble. He stood up to go to her. The moment he did, his knees buckled and he found himself falling into her arms.
She was a young girl, no older than fifteen, and she was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. She had auburn hair, big brown eyes and a lovely face.
He'd never met anyone so beautiful. And it wasn't just her face that had him mesmerized; it was the way she moved, the way she spoke, the way she looked at him as he stared at her. She seemed not to notice how he stared at her. She seemed to be oblivious of his presence. He had never thought about a woman before. He was too young to have thoughts like that. But there was something about this girl that grabbed his attention and wouldn't let go.
When she smiled at him, he felt as though the world stopped moving around him for a moment. It was like the sun suddenly coming out and bringing warmth with it after a long, cold winter. She made him feel so alive again. He realized that he had been cold for a very long time and that she was the warmth that he needed to warm him up again.
The moment she left the tavern, he followed her. He couldn't help himself. He had to know where she lived, what she looked like, who she was with, everything. He was determined to find out everything about her. But she didn't want to talk with him. She ignored him as if he wasn't there. He hadn't seen her since then, but he couldn't stop thinking about her and how much he wanted her to look at him again with those big brown eyes of hers.
His father warned him off her, telling him that she was nothing but trouble and that he shouldn't bother with her. But his father knew nothing about what was going on in his head. He was in love with her and nothing was going to stop him from finding out who she was and what she looked like. His father never had any idea how obsessed he was about her.
He tried asking around town for information on her, but no one seemed to know anything about her. Most people thought she was an orphan who came from the city and lived alone. When he heard that, he knew that someone was lying to him when they told him that she was an orphan. He knew that if she had any family who cared about her, they would have come looking for her by now. But no one knew anything about her family either; they all said that they didn't know anything about her family either because they'd never seen any family members with her before.
He decided to go into the city and find out for himself what really happened to her, but when he got there, it seemed as if every door in town was closed to him as soon as he set foot inside its walls. He couldn't get any information because everyone seemed to be afraid of talking to him because they thought he might be a spy sent by the king's men to find out what was going on in their town. They all refused to even acknowledge his presence in their town, but all they would do is shake their heads and act as if he wasn't even there when he tried talking to them.
The next time he saw her, she had entered the tavern where he worked again and sat at the same table where she had the night before and stared at him again as if he were someone who was completely insignificant in her life; as if he didn't exist at all. She ignored him and wouldn't even look at him when he came over to her table to ask if there was anything else that he could get for her or if there was anything else that she needed. She looked at him as if he were completely invisible to her and started to talk with another man in the tavern instead of with him as if he didn't exist at all.
She acted as if they were strangers who met in this tavern for the first time ever and she didn't know anything about this man sitting at this table with her.
As soon as she started talking to this other man, he felt like someone had punched him in the stomach; it hurt so much that it hurt even more than being hit by a charging horse in full gallop. He felt like his heart had stopped beating for a moment because of how much it hurt to see her talking with another man when all he wanted to do was talk to her and talk to her alone again like they had done when they first met in this tavern all those weeks ago when he first saw her sitting at this table.
He felt like someone had stabbed a knife into his heart when she left the tavern again without saying a word to him; without even looking at him as she left the tavern with the other man sitting at the table behind her who had come into the tavern while she was there with him before; who had seemed as important as anyone else in this tavern when she came in here with this man; and who suddenly became nothing more than just another stranger in this town when she left here with this other man sitting behind her instead of sitting behind him where she had always been sitting before when she came here with this other man.",1006,0.4441353494310567,-0.5106157650605679,-0.35928794811184483,-1.3498924708991,0.7752287910340953
87,R_1rdeLoM1qclMMol,BAS_HR_6,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been so busy that day with customers who wanted to talk about their problems and ask for advice that she hadn't caught his eye until it was too late. When he finally realized what she was doing, he couldn't help but stare. She wore an old-fashioned dress of black wool, cut low on her neckline and showing off a lot more cleavage than he liked. Her hair was long and loose, falling down over her shoulders as if it were made from spun gold. It was such a pretty shade of blonde, and it seemed to glow against the dark color of her dress. The way she held herself reminded him of a cat—her head up high, chin out, eyes narrowed in disdain. But there was something else about her that drew his attention. There was no mistaking it; she was beautiful. Even though he knew better, he could not take his eyes off her.
He watched her as she drank her ale and ate some bread and cheese. He kept stealing glances at her even when he wasn't looking directly at her. His gaze would wander back to her every few minutes, but she never noticed him. She didn't seem to notice anyone except the people she spoke to or the other men who came by to flirt with her.
After she finished eating, she got up and went outside to smoke a pipe. That's when he decided to try to speak to her. He approached her and asked if she needed any assistance. She turned around, startled, then smiled at him. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""You startled me.""
""It's all right,"" he replied. ""What can I do for you?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Are you new here? You don't look familiar.""
""No, I've lived here most of my life. What can I do for you?""
Her smile widened. ""Well, I just need someone to carry this stuff to my room for me."" She handed him a large bag filled with clothes and shoes.
He took the bag and followed her upstairs. As they walked along, he tried to think of something clever to say to get her attention again. Finally, he blurted out, ""Do you know what happened to the king's daughter?""
She stopped walking and stared at him. ""Excuse me?""
""The princess. Do you know why she ran away?""
""Why should I care?"" she asked. ""I haven't seen her since she left home.""
""That's because she is dead,"" he said.
""Dead? How did she die?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Everyone says she died in childbirth, but I heard that she was murdered. Someone killed her baby and then stabbed her.""
""Oh, dear,"" she said. ""Did she have a husband?""
""Yes, but I don't think he knows anything about it yet. They're still searching for her body. If they find it, then he'll be notified.""
""Where will they search?""
""They won't tell us. All we know is that they are going to search everywhere.""
""So, how do you know she's dead?"" she asked.
""Because she was supposed to marry Prince Arvin, but now he has no wife. So, everyone thinks that the prince must have done it. And if he did, then he would want to hide the evidence so no one would ever suspect him.""
""But who could kill the princess without being caught?"" she asked.
He shrugged. ""Maybe someone who knew her very well. Maybe someone she trusted.""
""And why would she trust them?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Because they loved her, maybe.""
""How do you know she was pregnant?""
""Because her maid told me. She said she was carrying twins.""
""Twins?"" she repeated. ""Really? Why would she have two babies?""
""I don't know. Maybe she already had one child and wanted another.""
She shook her head. ""I don't understand women. I only know about men. Men always want to make more children, especially after they get married. Women usually don't want to.""
""Well, I guess that makes sense,"" he said.
""Does it really? I mean, I've never thought about it before.""
He nodded. ""I suppose it does.""
When they reached her door, he set the bag down and helped her take off her coat. Then she opened her trunk and pulled out several dresses.
""Can you put these in my room for me?"" she asked.
He picked up the bag and carried it inside while she changed. When she was ready to go downstairs, she thanked him and gave him a small coin.
""Thank you for your help,"" she said.
As he left, he wondered whether she would ever see him again. He hoped she would, but he wasn't sure. He wished he had spoken to her earlier, but he couldn't change what had happened. He might have missed his chance forever.
He went back to work, trying to forget about her. After all, he was engaged to be married, and he didn't need any distractions. He had a good job and a nice fiancée. He didn't need anything else.
Two days later, he was surprised to see her sitting at the same table where he worked. He almost dropped his tray of food. He quickly walked over to her and apologized for dropping it.
""Don't worry about it,"" she said. ""It's all right.""
""I'm sorry. I hope I didn't ruin your meal.""
""Not at all. It was just a little spill. No big deal.""
He smiled. ""Good. Now, let me clean it up.""
He grabbed a rag and cleaned it up as best he could. ""Here you go,"" he said. ""I hope you don't mind that I spilled it.""
""Of course not. Thank you.""
He felt awkward standing there, so he walked away. He couldn't believe she was still there. He couldn't stop thinking about her. He wanted to talk to her again, but he was afraid of making a fool of himself.
The next day, she came to eat lunch with her friend. She sat in the same seat as the previous day. This time, he didn't drop anything, and he was able to serve her without incident. He was relieved that she was still there.
Later that afternoon, she came in again. He served her and then waited until she was finished eating. He was nervous, but he knew he couldn't stay quiet anymore.",1093,-1.3692840189438327,-0.4501205184803488,-0.7467596873294909,-0.5396586561825973,0.37924610142893816
88,R_2ttHGdpvMniyNtg,ALL_HSF_5,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The sun shone down like a golden orb, lighting up the blue-green clouds. They were low enough to see now that the spring had finally arrived. I looked back at my apartment, which was situated at the very top of one of the tallest buildings in downtown Athens. There wasn't much to look at there besides my place and the other three units on the floor, but I'd lived there since my arrival two years ago and felt comfortable. I turned to go down the stairs when a sudden thought hit me.
""Sato! What do you mean the president wants us to meet with him? Is he going to tell us something new about this mission?"" I asked as soon as I reached the ground floor.
She gave me a confused look. ""The president doesn't want to tell you anything. He wants you to be surprised.""
""That's not very reassuring,"" I replied. ""And what does he think is going to surprise us?""
""You'll see. Just make sure you're there on time."" She headed back toward her car.
I made my way through the crowds on the streets to the parking garage where my rover was parked. It was still early for the rush hour traffic, so it wasn't too hard to get out of the garage and onto the road. The rover took off smoothly as soon as I started driving, heading east toward the city center. The roads were wide here on Mars, and there was no need for lane markers or traffic lights. Instead, there were large yellow lines painted down the middle of each road, separating the lanes into sections. I drove at a steady pace, keeping an eye on the road ahead and scanning the sky. I didn't have to look far to spot the first signs of spring—a flock of birds flying in a V formation, and a single bright red flower growing on the side of a small hill. As I approached the city center, I saw the government buildings on the left, and then the massive white dome of the UN building on the right. The sun glittered off its curved surface, which reflected the light of the midday sun. It was a sight that never failed to impress me.
""Welcome to Athens,"" I said as I pulled into the parking garage of the government complex. The guards recognized me and waved me through, letting me into a secured parking area reserved for government officials. A security officer came over to check my ID. He scanned it and handed it back before waving me inside. I parked and walked across the foyer to the main reception area. It was a large open space with tall glass windows looking out into the city. A couple of people were sitting behind the counter, and they stood up as I approached. One of them was Sato, who greeted me with a warm smile.
""Hello, Takahashi-san,"" she said. ""Are you ready?""
I nodded as I looked around. ""As always,"" I replied.
She led me past the waiting room and down a long hallway. At the end of the hallway was a door, which was closed. We stopped outside and waited until a woman dressed in a dark blue suit opened it. She looked at us before nodding to Sato and walking away. Sato turned to me.
""We'll be leaving from the president's office,"" she said.
""So, he doesn't want to talk to me?"" I asked.
""He wants to talk to everyone,"" she answered. ""You're one of his most trusted advisors.""
The woman led us into an elevator and up to the top floor, where the president's office was located. As soon as we stepped off, she led us to a private meeting room and left us alone. We sat down and looked around. There were two men standing by the window, looking out at the city. They smiled when they saw Sato enter the room. I followed her gaze and saw the president sitting on a leather chair behind the desk, flanked by two women in business suits. The president waved to us before turning his attention back to the window. He was tall and wore a black suit. His skin was dark, like mine, but there was something different about him—a hint of a beard and a pair of thick glasses resting on his nose. It took me a second to recognize that this was the man who had been elected to be president of the UN.
""Takahashi-san, please take a seat,"" he said.
Sato and I sat down, and the two men moved to stand behind us. They placed their hands on our shoulders as if we were children being shown to their seats for the first time. The president walked over to a table in the middle of the room and poured himself a glass of water before taking a seat. He sat down with his feet stretched out in front of him and smiled at us.
""Thank you for coming, Takahashi-san,"" he said. ""I know how busy you are, so I appreciate you taking the time to meet with us.""
I nodded. ""Of course, Mr. President. It's an honor to have been asked to come here today. I hope I can help.""
""As do I,"" he replied. He took a sip from his glass and looked at Sato. ""Please tell me what you want me to know.""
Sato gave me a curious glance before starting to speak. She told him everything that had happened since the last time we'd spoken. About the incident with the Chinese ships and the discovery of the alien artifacts, as well as the recent discovery of a new artifact deep beneath the ice on Pluto. By the time she finished, I could see the president's face was dark with worry.
""So, this is all connected?"" he asked. ""All these incidents? They're related somehow?""
Sato nodded. ""It's possible they're all connected, yes.""
The president leaned back in his chair and rubbed his forehead. ""I've got some bad news for you, Takahashi-san,"" he said.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""Your mission will not be ending when it's supposed to.""
I looked at him in surprise. ""How can you say that?"" I asked. ""We've already completed all our objectives! We found the alien artifacts, and we returned to Earth without a single problem. We even came back ahead of schedule!""
""But that wasn't the point of your mission, was it?"" he answered. ""You were sent out to find evidence of extraterrestrial life, and that's exactly what you did.""
I shook my head. ""That's not what we were tasked to do. You said yourself that there's nothing in the reports that says we need to bring back any samples or data. We just have to come back.""
He took another sip of water and looked at me.",1206,-0.1463520810166815,-0.3869058756624623,-0.8404680435245369,-0.39945636973672694,0.5380996315339887
89,R_11XhenJ0Hws3Lcq,GEN_HF_2,High Fantasy,Genesis,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They circled around one tower before landing near the shoreline where they were met by three men wearing leather armor and carrying spears. Their faces were hidden behind steel masks that had been painted black.
""Welcome to my village,"" said the tallest man, his voice deep and rumbling. ""What do you want?""
""We seek your help.""
The tall man's eyes narrowed as he studied them. ""Why would I help you? You're strangers with no reputation among us.""
""Because we have something that belongs to you.""
All three warriors stiffened at this, the taller man stepping forward. ""Who are you?""
""I am called Zephyr,"" said Nia, lifting her chin proudly. She gave him a quick bow then turned to look at the other two. ""This is Ryn and Vaelin.""
Zephyr eyed them warily. ""And what do you have that belongs to me?""
Nia gave him an impish grin. ""A dragon egg.""
The warrior's eyes widened momentarily before narrowing again. ""You wouldn't dare… no, it must be true. How did you find it?"" He nodded at the basket hanging from Ryn's back.
Ryn shrugged. ""It fell down from the heavens.""
""As if there were such things,"" muttered the nearest warrior.
""I'm not joking,"" said Nia. ""There are dragons living in the mountains south of here. We found the egg washed up on the shore after a rainstorm and brought it here."" She paused to take a deep breath before continuing. ""We need your help retrieving it from the mountains.""
One of the warriors stepped forward, pointing a spear toward the sky. ""Come away now! This is no place for you!""
""Stay back!"" Nia shouted.
Her warning was too late as the tallest warrior leapt forward, swinging his spear at her. Nia's arm moved faster than anyone could follow, her fingers curling into a fist and snapping outwards, catching the spear-wielder across the face just below his mask. The impact sent the man stumbling backward, both hands grasping at his head, blood flowing freely from a split lip.
Another of the warriors recovered quickly and swung his spear at Nia again, this time aiming for her legs. She sidestepped easily though, her feet moving swiftly beneath her as she spun to meet the attack, her foot slamming into the warrior's groin before he could get his spear fully upright. His scream reverberated off the surrounding cliffs as he doubled over, clutching at his injured privates while Nia kicked him in the ribs and sent him collapsing to the ground.
She glanced at the third warrior, who had backed away from the scene and was staring at her with open disbelief. ""Are you okay?""
He nodded numbly. ""Yes, thank you.""
""Well, let's go then.""
The three of them hurried toward the village as fast as they dared without looking like they were trying to run. As they drew closer, Nia could see several more warriors standing in clusters around the buildings. None of them made any move to approach them but she still felt nervous. It was clear these men weren't going to give her the benefit of the doubt and she didn't blame them. Not after what had happened to the last person who tried to steal an egg from their village.
They entered the village and headed toward the largest building which appeared to be the only inn. Several villagers were gathered outside, talking quietly together. They stopped speaking when they saw the newcomers and watched silently as Nia and Ryn dragged the unconscious warrior inside the building. The other warriors approached the inn door cautiously, spears held ready, their faces hidden behind their masks.
The interior of the inn was dark and smoky, a fire pit burning brightly in the center of the room. Two tables had been pushed together at one end with a few stools placed around them. There were a handful of people seated at the tables, all watching the newcomers with suspicion. One man stood from his seat and walked over, holding a jug of wine and a cup. Nia recognized him as the innkeeper.
""What are you doing bringing trouble like this into our home?"" he asked. ""Take your friend and leave before I call the others.""
Ryn glared at him. ""Do you really think you'll be able to stop us?""
The man smiled grimly, placing the jug and cup on the table. ""Try me.""
""If you don't let us sit down and drink first, there won't be anything left for you to try.""
The innkeeper chuckled. ""Very well then, you can have whatever you wish.""
Ryn took a stool beside the table and gestured for Nia and Vaelin to join him. ""Thank you.""
""Don't mention it.""
""So, how did you find this place?"" asked Ryn, pouring himself some wine.
""It was mentioned by someone we encountered on the road.""
""How far are you from the mountains?""
""Not far. About two days' journey.""
""Good, because it seems the egg is about to hatch. We've seen signs of activity in the area.""
""Activity?""
""Dragons. Lots of them.""
Nia stared at him in surprise. ""You mean you're expecting a baby dragon?""
""That's right.""
The innkeeper placed a wooden platter on the table and brought over three steaming bowls of stew, setting them down before the travelers. ""Eat, eat. I'll bring another pot of stew later.""
Ryn thanked him and helped himself to some stew, helping himself to a second bowl after Nia finished hers. ""Tell me, how big is this egg?""
""It has yet to hatch so it's hard to say for sure. Judging from size and shape, I'd guess it will be somewhere between three and five meters long. That's pretty average for an egg from one of the larger species.""
""A dragon?"" asked Nia.
""No, not exactly. They're actually half human and half dragon. The offspring of a dragon and a human.""
""Where do they come from?""
""From eggs. Like the one you have with you.""
""I thought they hatched from live dragons?""
The innkeeper laughed. ""Sure, in stories. But the truth is that the eggs of most species are laid by the parents in caves or under rocks. When they're ready to hatch, the mother moves them to a safe place, often a cave or a nest high up in a tree. Then she leaves to hunt, leaving the father to fend for himself until the young emerge from their shells.""
""Fend for themselves?""
The innkeeper nodded. ""Most of the time it's just a matter of waiting.",1156,-0.28796121641237965,0.6456240858511312,-0.3438513473381008,0.3624271195179046,-1.6735217156544973
90,R_85J5HdLLjGY4EWB,OUR_HOR_8,Horror,Ouroboros,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The face had long red hair and sharp features that made it look like a corpse. I tried to scream, but my mouth was dry. Then I noticed my hand was in a cast. The woman's hand looked like mine until she started screaming, then they were reversed. ""Help! Someone help me!"" I cried. But no one came because I had fallen asleep.
The next morning, I decided to see if there was any coffee in the kitchen. There wasn't much and it was burnt. It smelled like someone had smoked weed before making it. When I went outside, I found two police officers waiting for me. One of them had dark curly hair while the other's hair was short with a black mustache. They had blue eyes and white shirts on.
""Can we talk with you?"" the blonde cop said.
I nodded and followed him to his car. He turned on some classical music and asked me all about what happened last night.
""Weird right? My name is Jane, what's your names?"" I asked.
""My name is Brian and this is Robert,"" he answered.
""I'm so sorry to wake you up at this time in the morning, but we really need you to tell us about what happened. We think it might be important, and we would hate to see anything happen to you,"" Robert said.
""Nothing happened. I had a bad dream. What do you mean it might be important?"" I said.
""Jane, we have reason to believe that the killer is in the area,"" Robert said.
""What?! Really, why? You should probably tell someone else than the person who is the victim,"" I said.
""The killer usually shows up before midnight. He kills whoever is in the house at the time. And then he takes their organs out. This has been happening since the 1950's.""
""Well, my parents moved here when they were teenagers. They got married and never left,"" I said.
""Well, that's good. There is only a small chance of anyone being the next victim. Let's just hope that doesn't happen,"" Robert said.
The police officers drove off, and I decided to make some coffee. Then I heard another knock on the mirror.
""Who is it?"" I called out.
""I'm coming in!"" a woman's voice answered.
""Just a second,"" I said as I closed the door behind me. ""What are you doing here?""
""I thought I'd come over for a cup of tea. I figured you had enough to do without worrying about me,"" she answered.
""What made you think that?""
""You didn't seem like a murderer yourself,"" she said as she took a seat.
""Yeah, well, I don't want to go to jail. I don't know what to say or do if the cops come back,"" I said.
""So, you've been a real help today,"" she said. ""How about we play a little game to pass the time. I'll start with a question. Who is the most famous person in the world?""
""What?"" I asked.
""You can't say anyone. The person you say, I will make sure no one knows the answer,"" she said.
""All right, I'll give it a shot. You want to hear something really dumb? What about the Pope? He is pretty famous,"" I said.
""Wrong,"" she said. ""What about Marilyn Monroe?""
I was stumped. ""No, that's not it either.""
""We're going to keep playing until you say the right answer. One more question,"" she said. ""Who is the smartest man who ever lived?""
""How could anyone be the smartest man who has ever lived? I would have to meet him,"" I said.
""Sorry to say, you never will,"" she said.
""I'm done. I just can't get past one. If you could do that to me, you can take over the world!"" I said.
""Of course, but I won't. Not yet. But when you least expect it, I will show up and then you will be in the middle of my world,"" she said as she walked off into the house.
""This isn't like me at all. I mean, I had coffee and was feeling fine,"" I thought to myself.
I went back into the house, took a shower, and got dressed. After I was finished getting ready, I decided to go out for some fresh air. I opened the door to see if I could find something good to eat. On my way home, I was about to turn off the road, but I heard someone call me from behind me.
""Jane, are you there?"" a man said.
I turned around to see him sitting on top of a garbage can. His skin was black and his eyes were green.
""My name is Robert. You look lost, can I help you?"" he said.
""Well, I am. I have no idea where I'm going. The only thing I know is that I want to go back to my house. But how am I supposed to get there if I don't even know where it is,"" I asked.
""Well, I will walk with you until I can figure out what's going on. It sounds like the killer is close, so we should hurry. Are you a fan of classical music?"" he asked.
""No, I hate it, especially that one."" I said, pointing to the classical music playing outside.
""We are about to cross over to the other side. We might be able to stop him from doing any more harm,"" he said.
I followed him across the road and he led me to an old house that was falling apart. He knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Then he unlocked the door and we stepped inside. When we got in, it was dark and cold. There was dust everywhere and the air smelled of mold.
""Do you think someone is here?"" I asked.
""Let's check, and we will find out,"" he said.
When we walked through the first room, I noticed it was very clean. We went upstairs and it looked untouched. Then we came to a bedroom that had a single bed, a nightstand, a dresser, and a closet. When I opened the door to the closet, there were no clothes inside, but a girl's face was looking back at us. She wore the same clothing as the woman I had seen before.
""Are you the killer?"" she asked.
""That's not your job. Why are you in this house?"" Robert asked.",1122,-1.5290352666863778,-0.981643047054455,0.2894618615086406,-0.7226877374593719,-0.7077682325554291

I could see his teeth through the open mouth that wasn't covered by skin. Then I realized this wasn't my reflection, this was someone else. It had to be my twin brother, but I didn't know how he'd gotten in here or why. I ran down the hall and started banging on doors. There was no answer. The house was eerily silent except for that voice. That terrible, inhuman voice. As I searched for answers, that terrible, inhuman face smiled at me. It began laughing at me.

""Shut up!"" I shouted. ""Who are you?"" I asked. He didn't answer, so I just continued looking around the room until something caught my eye. A box was sitting on top of the desk. I moved closer to get a better look and found letters inside the lid. I grabbed them all and tore them open. The first one read:
Dear brother,
I'm writing this letter from the other side. I don't think you'll ever make it there because the place we've been placed is too dangerous. You have to know how sorry I am for leaving you like this. I never wanted to do that to you but I felt I had no choice. You're probably wondering how I did it. I used our father's tools, of course. I used those to help me escape. I know you don't want to hear this right now, but I don't think you're going to make it back. Your mind will be consumed by the darkness that surrounds this place. I hope you can find peace, though. I know it won't be easy, but I believe in you.
Another note read:
I know how much you love your mom so I won't tell her about what I've done. I just don't see the point in doing that. She deserves to know, but she needs time to get over this. I don't even think she realizes what it means that you're gone. It was selfish of me to leave without warning her, but I needed to do it for you. Don't worry; she'll get over it.
The third one read:
I'm sorry for everything. I didn't expect to die when I tried to do what was right. I shouldn't have trusted the witch. There's so much I wish I could tell you. I think the most important thing would be how glad I am that you came here with me. You saved my life, and I know you didn't have to. I know you must have your reasons, but I want you to know I appreciate you for everything you've done. You're an amazing person. I think I told you that once before. It still applies.
The last letter read:
It's so good to finally be free. It took a lot of work, but I think it was all worth it. You were always so nice to me, but I think the best part is how you were willing to help me. I know it wasn't easy, but you did it anyway. I wish you could have seen me escape because you'd be proud. I don't want you to worry about me. I know you're probably scared right now. You should be, but just remember: no matter what happens, I'll always love you.
After reading those, I put down the letters and turned to see that demonic face in the mirror again. Then I heard the voice coming from behind me. ""You're not going anywhere,"" it said. I ran back to the box and grabbed the revolver that was lying next to it. The thing on the other side of the mirror smiled as it opened its mouth to talk again. It spoke: ""Do you know what it's like to be stuck in a place that you can never escape? It's the worst feeling ever! There's nothing worse than being trapped. That's why I want you to know that I'm going to kill you."" I placed my finger on the trigger and shot at the mirror. My bullet bounced off its surface.
Then the mirror shattered into a thousand pieces.
I sat there on the floor crying until someone knocked on the front door. I wiped my tears and ran to the foyer. I saw it was Mrs. Van Deuren. ""Oh, thank goodness,"" she said as I answered the door. ""Your father is gone. He left earlier this morning,"" I told her. She started crying. ""What happened?"" she asked. ""We lost him somewhere while he was hunting,"" I lied. ""Oh, no!"" she said. ""He won't like that."" I grabbed a few things from my room and headed for the front door. When I opened it, Mrs. Van Deuren was standing there with another woman. I had never seen her before. I didn't even know what she looked like. Mrs. Van Deuren introduced us. Her name was Mrs. Blunt. She took off running, but I just stood there, shocked.
""You'll never make it out of here alive,"" she said. I knew it wasn't Mrs. Van Deuren because she wasn't wearing the same dress. ""You're not going anywhere,"" Mrs. Blunt said again. Then, she took off running. I went after her, but I didn't want to kill her. I needed to find the witch first. Mrs. Van Deuren followed me out. We went inside. ""We should split up. That way we can cover more ground,"" I said.
""No, let's stay together,"" Mrs. Van Deuren insisted. We stayed in the kitchen. As Mrs. Van Deuren cooked, I took the opportunity to study her. There was something off about her, though. She seemed almost happy. She smiled when she made the toast. When I asked why, she told me that she'd finally found a family and that she wanted to protect them. That didn't make sense to me, so I questioned her.
She looked at me and said, ""I know what happened to your brother.""
I was stunned by her statement. I didn't know how she knew.
""How?"" I asked.
She looked at Mrs. Van Deuren and answered, ""Because we have a similar story. My son disappeared. He was gone for years, and I had no idea where he was."" She paused for a moment. ""Then he showed back up. The same as your brother: lost and alone,"" she continued. I was speechless.
Mrs. Van Deuren grabbed my arm and said, ""My mother and father left for the other side, too. They weren't supposed to do that. They were just supposed to stay on this side until you came. Now it's all messed up, and they can't find their way home. If they don't find the witch, they won't be able to come back.",1182,-0.6897327066364114,-0.1786919055882601,-0.7341496932083437,-1.3377616578519105,-0.3208449545372775
92,R_3lzUj5BfiUC0ZKX,LOW_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,Low Rider,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
As I walked through the park near my building, my mind went back to what had happened yesterday morning as I sat in front of my computer. My friend, the CEO of a major corporation, had sent an encrypted message asking me to meet with him alone. I'd been suspicious of this request from the start and had called up Dr. Sato first thing to get her opinion. She told me that she thought there was a very good chance that this could be a trap by some organization or another trying to steal our technology. The only problem is they probably wouldn't come right out and tell us what it was they were after. Instead, they would use all kinds of subtle tricks to convince us to hand over whatever they wanted. That was why Dr. Sato had suggested I contact a government official and ask if they knew anything about who might have approached us. Unfortunately, no one did, but the president still wanted to hear my story firsthand. And since he wasn't exactly a government official himself, that meant meeting him.
When I got to the president's office, I handed my ID card to the secretary. As soon as she looked it over and saw that I had permission to enter, she ushered me into the president's waiting room where he was seated behind his desk.
""Mr. President,"" I said, shaking his hand. He returned the gesture politely and then gestured to the chair across from him.
""Sit down, please. We'll go ahead and cut this meeting short so you can head back to work. You have plenty of things to do today, don't you?""
""Yes sir,"" I said.
The president pulled a small device off of his desk and set it on the table between us. Then he opened the lid and put a finger against its sensor pad. A few seconds later, the device lit up in front of him and began playing a video file from an unknown source. When the file started, it was a recording from someone's surveillance camera of my apartment building. As I watched, I noticed that whoever had been watching my home also had a very clear view of me and Dr. Sato's house.
The camera zoomed in to show me entering my building and then showed me leaving about ten minutes later, walking across the street toward a tall building that I knew housed both offices and apartments. There was no way they could have known this, which made me think that either someone close to me had betrayed me, or someone else had paid them a lot of money to follow me around. But who would pay such a price to see a single person? Whoever this person was must have been extremely interested in me, or they might have been just looking to catch Dr. Sato out and get information from her.
After I'd left my apartment, I'd seen a man standing on the other side of the street staring straight at me and holding a tablet in his hands. I didn't want to believe it at first, but I'd learned to always keep an open mind in this business. So I followed him around for a while until he entered another building and disappeared inside. I'd gone back to my apartment and then headed straight to Dr. Sato's, hoping she would know something about who might be spying on me. After speaking with her, I'd asked her to go to my apartment building and look around. If anyone had been following us, they would have left their fingerprints everywhere. Thankfully, she hadn't found any. At least not yet.
""So,"" the president said, turning his attention back to the video file still being played. ""What did you find?""
I sighed deeply as I thought back to everything Dr. Sato had told me about these strange people. They seemed to live in secrecy and were never seen or heard from anywhere except in public spaces like shopping malls, parks, and beaches. Their main goal seemed to be watching everyone around them, and the more we tried to hide from them, the more obvious it became that they were following us. Dr. Sato suspected that the organization that was monitoring me was somehow connected to the government, but she wasn't sure how. In fact, there was no connection whatsoever between her and the government, so I doubted that she'd stumbled upon something they didn't want us to know about. Still, it was important that we understand why we were being spied on so that we could deal with whoever was responsible and stop it.
""I have no idea,"" I said as I looked at the president. ""But if you're thinking that Dr. Sato is involved, think again. It doesn't make sense for her to be the one behind this.""
""No, I suppose it doesn't. Who else do you suspect?"" The president leaned forward in his seat as he waited for an answer. ""You've been working with her long enough now to recognize her unique qualities.""
""Well, it's hard to say at this point,"" I replied, taking a moment to collect my thoughts. ""Dr. Sato is very smart, but I don't think she's the type of person to be able to pull off something like this. Not without someone helping her.""
""Who's the only other person who knows the same things that Dr. Sato does?"" the president asked. ""That would be yourself.""
""Yes,"" I responded hesitantly. ""I'm not saying that Dr. Sato isn't capable of something like this, but it's highly unlikely that she's doing it alone. It has to be someone who has worked with us for a longer period of time than just a couple years.""
""Why would someone want to hire you and Dr. Sato if they don't already know what she knows?"" the president asked. ""Wouldn't they be wasting their money hiring two people who are already very well-informed about Mars?""
I took a deep breath before answering. ""I'm not really sure why, but we should assume that there's a reason for this and we need to find out what it is. I'm going to ask Dr. Sato to come to your office and let her explain everything herself. Hopefully, we can figure it out from there.""
""Very well,"" said the president. ""And what of the people following you?""
""They seem to be looking for Dr. Sato specifically, not me,"" I said.
""If that is true, we need to find out what they're after,"" said the president. ""Do you have any idea why they would want Dr. Sato?""
""Not yet,"" I answered. ""But I'll ask her once I speak to her in person. Until then, we can't jump to conclusions and start making decisions based on assumptions. We need to keep our heads cool and try to solve the mystery step by step.""
""Agreed,"" said the president. ""Let us leave the matter of your investigation with Dr. Sato for now, and we can discuss it at a later date when we have more information.""
I nodded and smiled as I stood up and started gathering my belongings. As I turned to go, I noticed the president reaching over to his desk and picking up a small device that I recognized from my own lab. He pressed a button on its screen and held it up in front of him as he spoke into his microphone.
""Dr. Sato is on her way here now. Please ask her to come directly into my office.",1319,-0.013479656722124854,-0.3956488472402551,-1.3411717825492926,-1.4229111891876274,0.012655207694878937
93,R_1ff7OXelHu3UI0r,ACE_HF_6,High Fantasy,Ace of Spade,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They walked around the lake until they reached an island where a large building stood. One tower was slightly higher than the other so that it leaned away from it.
""This is the place,"" said Kael as he stopped beside one of the windows and stared inside. ""I think I've seen this before.""
Kael's eyes were closed, his head tilted back. His mouth opened and shut several times, and then he said, ""There! In the middle room!""
Rikka frowned. She couldn't see anything in the dark chamber beyond the window. She took her dagger from her belt and used it to pry open the wooden shutter. Light poured through it revealing a small chamber filled with furniture covered in dust and cobwebs. The ceiling rose up above them and there was nothing else in the room save for a single chair sitting in front of a table.
She turned to look at him. He had been staring at the same spot on the wall since she'd pulled the shutter down.
He nodded once and pointed to another section of the wall near the door leading outside. ""That's where I saw it last time. There are three holes there. Look closely.""
She squinted and saw what he meant. Three small marks were carved into the stone just below the edge of the window frame. She pushed her dagger against one of them and pushed hard. The mark slid sideways along the stone, leaving behind a deep scratch.
""What is this?"" she asked, turning back toward Rikka. ""Did you know about this?""
""No,"" she replied. ""Why would anyone put those marks here? Are we supposed to go inside?""
""I don't think so,"" said Rikka. ""We should get going.""
They both started walking across the courtyard. Kael followed behind Rikka, looking back over his shoulder every few steps to make sure the doors hadn't moved. When they got to the top of the stairs that led down to the main level of the tower, he paused.
""Do you hear something?""
""Yes,"" she answered, not taking her eyes off the floor. ""Someone's coming. We need to hide.""
She ran back upstairs to find a hiding place while Kael crouched low and waited for the person to enter the tower. After a moment, he heard someone shuffling around in the upper levels. Then he heard the sound of footsteps moving slowly downstairs.
When the man came into view, he recognized him immediately. It was the same guard who had met them earlier in the morning. Kael held still and didn't say anything. He knew that if he tried to talk, he wouldn't be able to stop himself from giving everything away.
""It's nice to meet you again, my friend,"" the guard said as he approached Kael. ""How are you feeling today?""
""I'm fine,"" answered Kael without moving.
""Good,"" said the guard. ""Now, do me a favor and give me your dagger. Just drop it to the ground.""
Kael did as he asked, watching carefully as the guard bent down and picked it up.
""I'll take care of it now,"" said the guard, putting his hand under his cloak and pulling out a long sword. ""If you try anything funny, I won't hesitate to cut you down.""
Rikka appeared from behind a stack of crates and stepped out in front of the man.
""Who are you?"" demanded the guard.
""I am Rikka,"" she answered, drawing her own sword. ""You may call me Mistress Rikka.""
The man gave her a quick glance before returning his attention to Kael. ""Let me show you how we greet guests here.""
The man charged forward, swinging his blade wildly in a downward arc. Rikka sidestepped it easily and brought her own weapon up, slicing at his wrist. The guard dropped his sword and grabbed his arm, trying desperately to keep her from cutting him any deeper. But he wasn't strong enough. She sliced right through his flesh and into the bone beneath. He screamed out in agony, dropping his sword and holding onto his bleeding wrist.
As he fell to his knees, Rikka kicked him in the face. Blood spurted from his nose as he hit the floor and lay motionless. She spun around quickly and caught sight of Kael running toward her. He reached her in a second and wrapped his arms around her waist.
""Are you okay?"" he whispered into her ear.
""Fine,"" she assured him. ""Are you hurt anywhere?""
""No,"" he lied. ""Just scared.""
Rikka smiled, leaning her head against his chest. She felt safe for the first time in a long while.
""Come on,"" she said. ""Let's go.""
Together, they climbed down the stairs and headed straight for the door at the base of the tower. Kael knocked on it loudly several times, making sure everyone within hearing distance could tell they were there. When no one responded, he pounded on the wood with his fist.
After waiting several minutes, the door swung open. A woman stood in the doorway wearing a robe that was stained with blood. Her eyes went wide when she saw the bodies lying in the yard.
""Please come inside,"" she said.
Kael and Rikka walked past her and entered the tower. As soon as the door closed behind them, the woman locked it from the inside.
""Where's the other one?"" Rikka asked.
""He's in the room next to yours,"" answered the woman. ""Is he all right?""
Rikka shook her head. ""No.""
The woman looked confused. ""What happened to him?""
Rikka hesitated. She wanted to lie but she also didn't want to cause problems for the people in the village. Finally, she decided to tell the truth.
""His throat was slashed. I killed him.""
""Oh my God,"" the woman cried. ""You must have been terrified. I can only imagine what you thought was happening.""
Rikka nodded. ""It was awful. I never imagined I'd ever be in a situation like that.""
The woman crossed the room and hugged Rikka tight. ""I'm sorry this happened to you. I promise it will be taken care of.""
""Thank you,"" Rikka said.
She released the young woman and took a step backward. The woman opened a cabinet and took out a pitcher. She poured two glasses of water and handed one to Rikka.
""Drink this,"" she said. ""It will help calm you.""
Rikka took the glass and drank half of it in a single gulp.",1141,0.7334537304067255,0.8186988858673249,-0.22196966750623956,0.1715053984773227,1.3190157028695493
94,R_3Mn9t6Ho8Ob6Pjl,GEN_HOR_6,Horror,Genesis,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. My own, but not my face. The body had been cut in half with one arm dangling off the side of the mirror. It was bloodied and pale white. It smiled at me as if to say ""hello.""
""I'm dead,"" I said, and then I passed out.
When I awoke, I found myself sitting on the floor in front of the bathroom sink. Looking into the mirror now, I saw that it was just an ordinary mirror. There were no more people or monsters staring back at me. Instead, I saw a reflection of myself wearing black jeans and an old t-shirt. I stood up and brushed myself off before walking towards the door.
I opened it to see a man standing there. He was tall with dark hair, a goatee, and piercing green eyes. His shirt was torn open to reveal his bare chest. He grabbed my shoulder and spun me around. A second later, he was knocked unconscious by something falling onto him.
I turned around and saw another man lying on the ground. This time, he didn't look quite human. He was pale as a ghost with a sharp, angular jawline. One eye was covered in gauze while the other one was completely shut. He was clutching at his stomach and moaning in pain.
I ran over to him and pulled my phone out of my pocket. I pressed call button, but nothing happened. The screen remained blank. The man's breath was becoming more labored and his eyelids began fluttering. I panicked and tried to dial 911, but the same thing happened. I tried opening my browser and hitting refresh, but still nothing. Then, I remembered what the woman in the diner said about being in a place where the internet doesn't work.
I went over to the man who fell asleep and touched his wrist. He came to suddenly and clutched at the wound on his stomach. I took my car keys out of my pocket and gave them to him. He put them into his mouth and started chewing on them. Then, he pointed behind me and made a strange noise. I turned around to find two more men standing in the doorway. They were both holding guns and looked very angry.
""You want some too?"" I asked.
The man with the bandaged eye let out a loud scream and pointed his gun right at me. I stepped away from the man and raised my hands. The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye did the same.
""What is going on here?"" I asked.
""Who are you?"" one of the men replied.
""I'm a friend of the lady you guys attacked in the diner.""
""Just stay down for a minute and we'll get answers out of you,"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said.
""Okay,"" I said.
He pointed his gun at me and pushed me backwards against the wall. I didn't fight back. I just waited for whatever they wanted to do. The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye reached into his pocket and pulled out a small knife. He quickly sliced through the rope that was tying my wrists together. I rubbed my wrists where the ropes had dug into them so deeply.
""Why would they attack her?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye asked.
""I don't know,"" I answered. ""But I think she has some sort of connection to what's happening around here. She seemed surprised when I told her about my brother. That's why we were there.""
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye held up his hand and made a fist. A moment later, I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. Then, I felt my neck being twisted as hard as I could stand.
""What the hell?"" I screamed.
I tried to turn around, but the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye pushed me back against the wall. He leaned down and placed his ear next to my mouth.
""Not so loud,"" he whispered.
I nodded and he released me. I turned around to see the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye pointing his gun at me again.
""I don't have any answers,"" I said. ""I haven't seen anything like this before either. I can't help you.""
""There's a room upstairs,"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said. ""We'll take care of things there.""
I looked up to see two more men coming up the stairs. They were dressed in black suits and carried large guns in their hands.
""Do what you need to do,"" I said.
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye reached into his pocket once again and took out a small bottle. He unscrewed the lid and sprayed some liquid on my face. Then, he picked up the man who was tied up in the corner and threw him at the wall. The man bounced off the wall and slid to the floor. He groaned in pain as he tried to get up.
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye dropped the empty bottle and pulled out a small syringe. He jabbed it into the man's stomach and then injected something into his veins. The man's skin became red and blotchy and he began bleeding from his nose.
""So, what's your name?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye asked.
""I'm Michael,"" I said.
""Michael, huh?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said. ""Well, Michael, I guess you're our prisoner for now. We'll be back to talk to you soon enough.""
They all left the room and closed the door behind themselves. I ran over to the fallen man and saw that he was shaking. I helped him up and led him into the bathroom. I washed his face and cleaned the blood from his arms and chest. Then, I sat him down on the toilet and gave him water to drink. After he finished drinking, I wiped his lips clean and removed the gauze wrapped around his eye. It was red and swollen. I pressed my fingers against the wound and he cried out in pain.
""It hurts,"" he said.
""Sorry,"" I said. ""Let me see what I can do to help you.""
I carefully removed the bandage and saw that the skin underneath was very raw and inflamed. The area around the wound had turned bright purple. There was also a large lump sticking out of his cheek.
""Oh, God,"" I said. ""Are you okay?""
""I'll be fine,"" he said. ""It will heal eventually.""
I sat down next to him and rubbed his back. He closed his eyes and sighed.
""I hate needles,"" he said. ""That was the worst pain I've ever felt.""
""I'm sorry,"" I said.
He chuckled and leaned his head on my shoulder.",1199,-1.3844352243544793,0.6874006337697588,1.8673429821276892,0.9223962512539257,-0.8252879930979583

I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. I couldn't see his eyes, but I did see his teeth, which were all black.
""Who is there?"" I asked.
""You know who I am.""
""No, who are you?""
""I am the one who brought you here,"" he said.
""Why did you bring me here?""
""I needed to get the answer that I want from you.""
""What do you want?""
""Do you have a last name?""
""No.""
""Do you know where you are?""
""No.""
""Why not?""
""I was unconscious for a long time.""
I looked at the wall. ""I don't know how long.""
""You were unconscious for a very long time. You were in a coma for a very long time.""
""What does that mean? What happened to me?""
""You were in a car accident. You were in the hospital for a very long time as well.""
""A car accident? What kind of accident?""
""You don't remember? You don't remember anything? You don't remember who you are?""
""No, I don't remember anything,"" I said. ""I don't even know my last name.""
He smiled at me and then said, ""You have one. It is Rourke.""
""So that means I'm a Rourke?""
He nodded. ""Yes, you're a Rourke.""
""Oh,"" I said. ""I guess that's good, right?""
He nodded again. ""Yes, you're a Rourke and that is good. But do you remember what happened before the accident?""
I shook my head. ""No,"" I said. ""I'm not sure I want to remember what happened before the accident.""
He nodded again and then said, ""Maybe it would be best if you didn't remember what happened before the accident."" He looked at me and then smiled. ""Maybe it would be better if you didn't remember your last name either."" He then laughed, but it sounded like he was choking in his throat. ""Maybe it would be better if you didn't remember anything at all.""
He opened his mouth and all of his teeth turned at once, and he screamed at me. He screamed so loud that I couldn't believe it. It seemed like he was screaming for hours and hours. The more he screamed, the more scared I became. Then he stopped screaming and put his mouth to his mouth again and coughed out black smoke, which he started breathing in. Then he turned and walked out of the mirror and disappeared. I watched him walk out of the mirror and disappear into thin air.
I walked to my kitchen and made myself some tea. Then I went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet seat to take a shit. When I looked into the toilet bowl, there was a face looking back at me. The face had black teeth and black hair, just like the man in the mirror did, and he was smiling at me as well. When I looked into the mirror again, the face disappeared, but this time it did so much faster than it had before.
I walked out of the bathroom and went back into my bedroom where I sat down on my bed, still wearing my pajamas. I was still in shock from seeing both faces looking back at me in the mirror. Then something else came into my mind, something I had been thinking about for a while now. Something that had been bothering me for a long time now. Something about what happened earlier today when I had seen that man walking around my house in my pajamas and thinking he was me walking around my house in his pajamas. Something about what happened that made me think I was losing my mind again. Something about what happened that made me think I was going insane once more after having thought I was over it all this time since last year when the accident had happened to me. Something about what had happened to me that made me want to put my hands into my ears and stop hearing what was going on around me because everything sounded like it was coming from hell itself when it wasn't even close to being like anything I have ever heard before, even when it comes to music. Something about what happened that made me think I was going crazy again after having thought I was finally over it all this time since last year when the accident had happened to me.

96,R_10V3cge65YtUh2i,OUR_HOR_7,Horror,Ouroboros,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't mine, but it wasn't human either. It had four arms and legs and a mouth with several rows of sharp teeth. Its eyes were yellow like an owl's, but they were also very large and almost appeared to have no whites in them at all.
It had been making noises as it knocked on the glass. It seemed to be talking or chanting something. I couldn't make out the words though. The room suddenly began to smell like rotting meat and old dirt. I started to feel sick to my stomach, and I started backing away from the mirror. I turned and saw that the bed sheets were covered in blood. I stepped back again and then realized I was standing right next to the bed. In the reflection of the mirror, I could see that I was not only naked but completely covered in blood.
The mirror suddenly disappeared. I turned around to see if the creature was still there, but I didn't see anything. Then I realized I was lying on my stomach and the pillowcase I'd put my hair in was lying beside me. There wasn't a mark on it so I knew it hadn't been broken.
I looked over at the bloody bed and thought about how strange that all felt. How did the bed get this way when I was in it? Why do I have blood all over me? Did someone get hurt in here and pass away while I slept? If I got out of bed, where would I go? It was too late to call for help because no one could find me in this place, and I wouldn't have wanted to have to explain this to anyone anyways.
I had an idea. I got up and started looking through the drawers in my dresser. I found some socks and a shirt. They weren't any kind of clothing that I owned but they would have to do. I put them on quickly and then ran downstairs into the kitchen. There were no lights on, but it was pretty bright inside since the windows were open and the night was just beginning.
As I made my way toward the front door, I heard a noise coming from behind me. I turned around to see the mirror again. There was nothing inside of it anymore. I picked up the handle to open the door and stepped outside. It was raining now, and I could smell fresh, new snow on the air. I walked a bit more down the road and came across a man wearing a gray coat walking along the street. He had dark hair and eyes, and was carrying a black briefcase in his hands. I smiled at him and said, ""Hi.""
""Hello,"" he answered with a smile back.
""You live nearby?"" I asked.
""Yes, I'm a friend of your mom's, Mrs. Talbot. She's been asking about you. How are you? Are you feeling okay?""
""Yeah, I guess. I wasn't feeling so great before but I think it was just something I ate.""
""Do you know where she is right now? I really need to talk to her. I have some things I want to tell her. They're very important, and I don't know if I can wait until morning for her to get home.""
""She left a while ago,"" he told me. ""I think she went over to the neighbors house.""
""Thank you! Thank you so much!""
""Are you sure that you're not still sick?"" he asked as we approached the corner.
""No. I just feel a little dizzy,"" I assured him. ""I'm going to go straight there. Can you take me?""
""Sure thing.""
We walked together in silence as we came up to the house. The man opened the door and helped me inside. We both got on our knees and bowed down to kiss the ground. My friend closed the door behind us and then sat down on his heels again.
""Can you show me what your mirror says?"" he asked.
He handed the briefcase to me and I opened it. Inside were several pieces of parchment and a notebook. I took one of each out and handed them back to him. He read the first page quickly and then looked up at me with an amazed expression.
""Do you know who this is? It's your sister, Tiffany!""
I could hardly believe what I was hearing. My mouth dropped open and I started to shake my head.
""You know her name?"" I managed to ask. ""Where is she?""
""She's in France!"" he said. ""I found all of the information from the diary in here and it turns out that she and her mother had come here when she was a baby. They thought it would be easier to raise her in Europe, where they spoke the language. She lived here until she turned eighteen years old and then she left for college.""
""That's so weird,"" I said. ""How could we possibly have the same last name if we don't even look like each other? Did she ever say anything about me?""
""No, but I think it was probably just that you weren't born yet when she left here. I mean, how would she know?""
""Wait a minute,"" I said, stopping him before he could start to speak again. ""Why are we on our knees?""
The man smiled and said, ""It's the custom here. The way I'm told is that our ancestors did it when they came to this land as well. You must thank the spirits for helping you find your sister and help you to reunite with her once more. They're the ones that guided us here, after all.""
I looked around at the house again. It seemed so much darker in there now. There was also something different about the walls, but I couldn't figure out exactly what was different until I reached down and picked up a piece of parchment that had been written upon. It was only a few sentences long and the handwriting was different than the rest of the paper, almost like it belonged to someone else. I put it back into the briefcase.
""Thank you,"" I whispered. ""I should probably go home and tell my mom everything. She'll want to meet Tiffany right away.""
""Of course,"" he said, standing up. He held out his hand. I shook it and thanked him again for everything he'd done. We walked outside and stood in the rain. I went over to the door and opened it, waiting until the man got back into his car before I closed it again. I didn't see anything in the mirror anymore so I took off running down the sidewalk. I was pretty sure the woman would have given me directions if she were still there.
I turned down the street toward where I thought my mom's house was and found her waiting for me when I got there. She was in front of the house, waiting for me to arrive. She smiled at me and then ran over to hug me.
""Tiffany!"" she cried, squeezing me so tightly that it hurt.",1244,0.0966817134290081,-0.959326926786033,-0.6928338952146104,0.19244781910779116,0.2505085159479965
97,R_3huQaqpmywETW2M,OUR_HF_9,High Fantasy,Ouroboros,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. The party found themselves taking cover behind a pile of rubble near the foot of the nearest tower, peering across the lake to get a better view of the village.
""Where do you think those people have gone?"" asked Caramon, his gaze darting nervously around the area as though expecting an army of kender to pop up out of the grass at any moment. ""I mean, look at this place! Why would anyone live in a place like this?""
""If you don't want to die,"" Soli replied grimly, her eyes fixed on a patch of trees some distance away, ""stay very still and quiet.""
""No one's going to come here!""
""They might,"" said Soli. ""Especially if they're looking for us."" She kept her voice low so that only she could hear her words.
Caramon gave her a sour look but didn't argue further as they both remained motionless against the pile of rocks, listening and watching for movement. Finally they heard the sound of footsteps approaching. Both of them stiffened in dread at the thought of a kender leading the way. Then came the sound of voices and shouts.
""Who goes there? Who dares disturb our peace?""
""We need to speak to your lord! We seek a meeting with—""
""A meeting?"" the old woman scoffed, laughing scornfully. ""Is that what you call it?"" She strode past the pair of them and disappeared into the trees.
Caramon and Soli exchanged glances before they moved away from their hiding place. They crossed the open area between them and the village. As they drew close to the two towers, the sounds of voices became clearer.
""This is the kender we saw down in the valley,"" a man was saying. ""He claimed to be looking for his friend, the lord of this village. I wonder who he could be talking about.""
""It must be a ruse,"" another voice declared. ""They must be lying to us.""
""Who knows?""
""You,"" a third voice called. It sounded familiar to Caramon. ""You've got to help us.""
The sound of heavy footsteps drew near. The pair froze in place, every fiber of their being urging them to run but somehow unable to move. They were like two pieces of clay in the hands of a skilled sculptor, forced to stand immobile as he molded them into his shape.
""What do you want?"" Caramon's father demanded.
""Lord Bismarck! We have no time to waste!""
""Then come inside."" The man turned and began walking back into the village.
""I can't,"" said Soli, grabbing Caramon by the shoulder and pulling him away. ""Not with my powers!""
""With what powers?""
""You're not going to believe it."" Soli shook her head, refusing to tell him. Caramon looked at her as though he could read the thoughts passing through her mind.
""How can you not believe it?"" she asked. ""That's your father!""
""You're right,"" Caramon agreed. ""It is."" He smiled broadly as his father approached.
""It's good to see you again, Caramon,"" he said, looking at his son. ""But I must say, you've grown up far too fast for my liking.""
""You'd know all about that!"" Caramon grinned. ""All the girls were in love with you.""
""It wasn't always like that,"" his father said. ""Back when I was a young lad—back before the War of the Lance, you might say, I had much less trouble getting girls.""
""Oh yeah?""
""And then one day a kender came wandering by and offered to help me win the hearts of women."" His father frowned, thinking back to his youth. ""It worked at first. Girls were falling all over themselves just to get near me.""
He laughed and winked. ""Of course, it didn't last long. No matter how hard I tried to change things, I could never seem to get rid of that damn kender. It was like I was chasing him around the whole time! Eventually, I gave up, threw out the little vermin, and things returned to normal.""
""Normal?"" Caramon snorted. ""You mean before the War of the Lance?""
""No, that was normal."" His father smiled wistfully, his memories taking him back to his younger years. ""I'd go to sleep and wake up to find that some kender had moved in and was living under the bed.""
""You really did?""
His father nodded. ""And when I left the room to answer the door to a potential suitor, they'd turn my chair over and play with my feet."" He laughed and shook his head. ""When I was older and married, I used to worry about what my wife would do if she found me dead on the floor of the bedroom with my fingers still buried in her hair.""
""You're full of jokes today,"" Caramon remarked. ""But how come you can't find any kender now?""
""I haven't seen one since that last war."" His father smiled wistfully. ""I thought I saw a kender down there in the valley, but it turned out to be a kobold. It wasn't until I looked closely that I realized he was human.""
Caramon blinked in surprise. ""I don't think I've ever met a kobold before.""
""Neither have I."" His father frowned. ""They say that kender were originally the offspring of humans and kobolds. They claim it's true. Of course, we can't be sure."" He looked at Caramon. ""Are you by any chance related to a kender named Soli?""
""Who's Soli?""
""You might have heard of her."" His father sighed. ""She and her friend were involved in a few adventures in the past. The two of them made quite a name for themselves.""
""Really?""
""Yeah. No one seemed to mind when she helped those knights of yours fight off those dragons and bandits. But then she went rogue. That was back when her old master, Grognard, was still alive."" He sighed again. ""Now he's gone and no one seems to know where she is. But if you want my opinion—""
""Yes?""
""Don't trust her. Not a single step.""",1069,-0.8304207214757637,0.39417290083891504,-0.7189661035752508,-0.716593252442476,-0.03662613451440993
98,R_8HfqCuLrhXbemPv,GEN_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,Genesis,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
It had taken me almost two years to get used to living on Mars. The time difference between Earth and Mars meant that I usually slept when it was night on Earth and worked during the daytime on the Red Planet. That made my sleep schedule difficult to maintain, especially because I found myself staying up late just to watch movies or TV shows online while people were sleeping back home. Now that I was working on something important, though, I'd been keeping a regular schedule as best I could.
The problem was that my job didn't involve anything Earth-like; my team was working on ways to grow crops in the cold Martian soil. Our goal was to make sure that there would be food available for the growing colony once we arrived. We were also investigating how to create a sustainable environment for humans so they wouldn't need to spend their lives in spacesuits like astronauts did. I understood why NASA wanted us to focus on those issues, but I wasn't excited about the work. Growing crops was different than what I expected to do when I signed up for this program, and I missed being able to drive cars and go outside without wearing a bulky suit.
My next stop was the cafeteria where I grabbed a few breakfast items along with some coffee. After eating, I drove my rover to the base of Mount Sharp, which is the tallest mountain on Mars. There are actually three mountains in the region called the Gale Crater—Mount Sharp, Aeolis Mons, and Pavonis Mons. We were focusing our efforts on the middle peak, which was the most accessible and easiest to explore.
We had been researching Mount Sharp since before I joined the project, trying to find out what it looked like under the ground and whether it might contain evidence of life. Because of the low gravity, the rocks there tended to break apart easily when we dug them up. This made things more challenging for us than if the rocks had stayed intact underground. Still, we were making progress because we were using robots designed for the task. One such bot, named Sojourner, was sent down into a long tunnel to study the area around the mountain's base. Unfortunately, after four months of traveling through the tunnels, Sojourner was unable to reach the surface. When we tried to send another robot, Pathfinder, inside the mountain, it too failed to complete its mission. We were having problems finding a way to penetrate the mountain and figure out what was going on.
Now that I was heading back to my lab, I thought about the latest report from Curiosity, which was a rover exploring the crater. The rover had been exploring the area around Mount Sharp ever since arriving on Mars, and now that it had reached the top, it was sending back photos. Like everything else on the planet, Mount Sharp had a unique look. Instead of one uniform color, it was covered in layers of rock that ranged in texture and color. We knew that many of these layers formed over millions of years, but the exact process remained a mystery.
Curiosity had been taking pictures of the rocks, and I wanted to see what they looked like. Even though I was on the other side of Mars, Curiosity was still my closest friend. The rover had been designed to explore the Red Planet, and it was doing an excellent job of fulfilling its mission. It might not be able to talk to me directly, but we were always communicating with each other.
When I arrived at the lab, I saw that all of the lights were off except for the one in my room. I walked past the others who were working on various projects, and then went straight into my own laboratory. Once I was inside, I powered on the computer and logged into the main system. I was hoping to find new information about the mountain, but instead I saw a video of the rover on the screen. Curiosity was driving along the edge of a cliff, and the camera followed the vehicle as it passed through a narrow opening. Then the rover suddenly stopped, and the screen went black. A loud noise rattled the speakers in the lab, and I jumped up from my seat.
""What happened?"" I asked Dr. Sato, who was sitting across the table from me. She turned off the computer and closed the lid.
""I don't know,"" she said. ""Maybe the rover has suffered a malfunction.""
""That can't be good,"" I replied. ""Why isn't anyone else worried about this? Shouldn't someone be checking on the rover?""
""Normally, yes. But it's in the middle of nowhere. There's no way to get there right now. Besides, we're dealing with bigger issues.""
The door opened behind us, and Dr. Sato got up to greet President Franklin. He was tall and wore a dark blue suit, which made him stand out among the other scientists. He shook hands with Dr. Sato and then sat down at the table in front of me.
""You must be Dr. Watson,"" he said. ""Welcome to Mars. I'm glad you decided to come.""
""Thank you, sir,"" I replied. ""But I don't understand why you need to meet with me today.""
""I've heard a lot about your research, and I wanted to learn more,"" he explained. ""If you have a minute, I'd like to ask you some questions about it.""
""Of course,"" I said. ""Let's start by talking about the rover that stopped moving last week.""
President Franklin nodded. ""Yes. I read the report that came in yesterday morning.""
""How did it happen?"" I asked, leaning forward on my chair. ""Do you know what happened to the rover?""
His expression darkened, and he shook his head. ""No. We're working on it as quickly as we can. Right now, I don't want to speculate about what might have caused the problem. All I can tell you is that we will let everyone know when we have more information.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""But have you given any thought to sending a rescue mission to try to fix the rover?""
""Not yet,"" he replied. ""There are several issues to consider first. First, we don't know where the rover is exactly. Second, if the rover does require a repair, there are only limited options for getting supplies to it. In the meantime, we'll continue to monitor the situation.""
""And the other issue?"" I continued.
""Right now, our priority is making sure that we can grow enough food for the colonists,"" he explained. ""I'm not saying that we won't be interested in a rescue mission in the future, but that will depend on the results of our studies. Until then, you should focus on doing your job.""
The conversation ended there. I left the lab feeling frustrated that I couldn't share my thoughts with anyone. My boss didn't seem to care about the fate of the rover, and neither did any of my coworkers. As far as they were concerned, Curiosity wasn't part of the Mars project, either. It was just a machine, and it had nothing to do with me.

I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had dark eyes and black hair that came down to its shoulders, but it wasn't human. The skin around its mouth was twisted, like someone who had been chewing on something bad for their teeth. Its nose was crooked in a way that made it look like it would fall off any second now.
The creature's voice sounded strange as well, deep and raspy. ""Hello?""
""Who are you? What do you want?"" I asked.
It smiled. ""I'm your friend.""
My heart began to race. This thing didn't just mean harm; it wanted to kill me! There must be some other explanation. Maybe its voice had an effect on me and made me think this thing was my friend.
""We're not friends,"" I said, trying to sound brave. ""You have no friends here.""
""No, we don't,"" the creature agreed. ""But maybe you will soon. Come with me if you want to live.""
I backed away from the mirror and shook my head. ""Don't try to trick me. You are going to kill me!""
""We could pretend that, but that wouldn't really make us friends, now would it?""
I knew he was right. My only choice was to take him seriously. ""Alright, how do I know you won't hurt me?""
He leaned forward, his lips brushing against the glass. ""Trust me.""
I took a step toward the door, but there was another knock on the mirror before I reached it. ""Come with me,"" it called.
I turned back to the mirror. ""What is it?""
""We need to talk.""
""Please, let me go.""
""Not yet.""
I sighed. ""What do you want to talk about?""
The creature's smile widened. ""I'll tell you later.""
I hesitated before leaving the room. If this thing meant harm, I couldn't run away. The most I could do was hope it wouldn't kill me. When I left the room, there were two more knocks on the mirror. ""Wait here.""
When I opened the door, I saw a man sitting by the table. He was dressed in a black suit and tie, and his hair was combed back. There was no mistaking what he was; he was one of them.
""Hi,"" he said when I entered the room. His voice was deep and smooth. ""I'm glad you're here. Would you like some tea?""
I shook my head. ""Do you know why I am here?""
""Yes.""
""Then you can tell me.""
He held up a finger. ""We have a few things to discuss first.""
I nodded. ""Okay.""
He stood up. ""Follow me.""
I followed him through the house and then outside. We passed several people on the sidewalk before reaching the street. They all looked normal, like they had nothing to hide. I glanced behind me, but there was nobody following us.
""So,"" the man said as we started walking again, ""what is your name?""
""I'm not telling you my name.""
He stopped walking. ""Why not?""
""Because I don't trust you.""
""That's fine. But I do need a name so that I know what to call you.""
""How should I decide which name to give you?""
He chuckled. ""Isn't there a story where a man gives his daughter a name and she hates it? She calls herself something else and her father has to change it to what she wants.""
""What does that have to do with anything?""
""Well, shouldn't you pick a name?""
I shrugged. ""Maybe.""
""Your name will be 'Sidney,'"" he said.
I laughed. ""You're joking, right?""
""No, I'm serious. Do you want me to choose another name instead?""
I shook my head. ""I guess I'll have to get used to it.""
As we continued walking, the man kept talking. ""You've been wondering why you're here, right? That's good. I want to help you understand.""
""I don't need your help.""
""Really?""
""Yeah.""
""What are you afraid of?""
I glanced around, but nobody was watching us. ""Nothing.""
""That's interesting. How old are you?""
""Nineteen.""
""And what do you plan to do with your life?""
""I don't know. Go to college. Get married someday.""
He nodded. ""But you also know that we aren't supposed to do those things anymore.""
""We're not supposed to do them, or we're doing them wrong? Which is it?""
""Both. Some people still do what is expected of them, and others don't. The ones who don't are labeled as rebels, and the ones who do are treated like heroes.""
""Sounds like you're making stuff up.""
""No, I'm not. Most people know the truth, but they refuse to accept it because it conflicts with their beliefs.""
""Beliefs? Like what?""
""You believe that if you try hard enough, you can achieve whatever you want in life.""
""I don't even know what you mean by that.""
He tapped his temple. ""I told you earlier that you were special. You are. Your mind contains abilities that are beyond what most people can imagine. And you use them every day without realizing how great you truly are.""
""I don't want to hear this.""
""It's okay. I just wanted to explain why we brought you here. We knew you'd resist us at first, but we hoped that eventually you would see the truth.""
""See the truth? What does that even mean?""
""A lot of people think they know the truth. They may not realize it, but they believe in something that is real to them. For example, they might believe that there is a God and that he created everything in the world. Or they may believe that money is the best way to measure success.""
I stared at him. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""
""Of course you do. Everyone does. You just haven't realized it yet.""
""What do you think I believe?""
""You believe that you're normal, and everyone else is different.""",1012,-0.017003826935678742,0.8770553290754248,1.0358713254414706,1.2559236265422729,0.9296370332306522

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I had a long drive ahead of me, but as always, I enjoyed the time alone in the car. There were so many things I wanted to ask Sato about her recent visit to Earth, but she was being cagey and hadn't given me much information. The only thing I knew for sure is that there were no aliens involved in this meeting.
I drove up to the presidential estate in the center of Mars City, where I parked next to a dozen other vehicles in the parking lot. After walking through the security checkpoint, I went inside the main entrance where several people were waiting. One looked familiar, but after a few more moments of staring I realized it was Dr. Sato who greeted me warmly. She led me through another set of doors and down some stairs that would lead us outside to a large courtyard surrounded by buildings. A couple of soldiers stood guard at one end, scanning everyone who entered. They wore armor, carried rifles, and kept their eyes locked on each person passing by them. I had never seen such militarized guards before. The president must be very serious about keeping this place secure, I thought as we walked across the courtyard towards a set of glass double doors. We stopped when we reached the doorway and waited until two men carrying briefcases came out first. One was wearing the standard suit of clothes, while the other wore a full lab coat and had glasses hanging around his neck. He also held a briefcase in one hand. Sato introduced them both as Mr. O'Malley and Professor Kuznetsov. When they saw me, Professor Kuznetsov smiled broadly. ""You are even more impressive than your file claimed,"" he said.
""Thank you,"" I replied. He was tall with graying hair, and seemed to have the kindest eyes. As I studied him a bit closer, I noticed his skin was quite white compared to everyone else in the room. It was also covered with a thick layer of red patches and blotches that resembled the red dust from Mars. Even so, he still didn't look any different than I did, except perhaps healthier. His face was smooth, and his hands had no wrinkles or age spots. I wondered if I could have the same sort of longevity treatment when I grew old.
We continued walking past the security guards and through another set of double doors until we reached a large oval-shaped conference table sitting in the middle of the room. Sitting across from me were President Anderson and Dr. Sato. I sat down next to Professor Kuznetsov, who offered me a smile before turning back to President Anderson.
""Please, be seated,"" President Anderson told me as he pulled out the chair next to him.
As we began talking, I found out Dr. Sato was actually a woman named Yuki Sato. Apparently she was born on Earth and had spent most of her life working in labs there. She was an expert on human cloning—which I found surprising since I didn't think anyone else even knew it was possible. She started telling me how she met Professor Kuznetsov on Earth and they worked together to perfect the technology needed to clone a human body. Then, using the same process, they created artificial bodies that could survive in Martian conditions and function just like normal humans. The first one was made for President Anderson himself.
""What about this?"" asked Dr. Sato, pointing to the red patch on my arm that was visible beneath my shirt sleeve. I looked down and saw that it appeared to have gotten bigger during our discussion.
""It doesn't concern us,"" answered President Anderson. ""If your skin color has anything to do with this then you're welcome to stay here as long as you wish."" He paused, looking at me for a moment. ""So what exactly are you here for?""
""I was hoping to find out where your people have come from,"" I replied. ""How they got to Mars and why they want to destroy all of humanity.""
Dr. Sato interrupted with a raised hand. ""We already know that, but I don't see how we can help you,"" she said.
President Anderson smiled and nodded. ""Well, Dr. Sato, I'm afraid this young man is right. We know very little about how these aliens arrived here or where they came from."" He looked over at me, and then turned back to Dr. Sato. ""I suppose if they were willing to give up all their secrets, you would probably want them to stay here with us forever,"" he added.
""No, sir, I wouldn't,"" I replied with a sigh.
""Then let me explain something to you,"" said President Anderson, leaning forward in his chair and speaking in a low voice. ""This isn't the first alien attack we've suffered. It seems as though they are targeting only certain countries that seem important somehow to our society. We know the Chinese attacked us a few years ago. Our government wasn't prepared, but fortunately the aliens couldn't figure out how to get through their military defenses. However, there have been attacks against our neighbors to the south.""
The president's words surprised me. The Mexican president? I wondered if they were related somehow to Dr. Sato. Maybe they were all connected. Or maybe they weren't even the same people at all, but some other species living in Mexico. If that was true, then perhaps I really was dealing with a new species of alien that was able to communicate with humans and manipulate their minds.
""That doesn't make sense,"" I said, shaking my head slowly. ""Why haven't they attacked us again? Why aren't they attacking the US directly?""
""Maybe we have something they want,"" suggested Professor Kuznetsov from next to me. ""Maybe that's why they haven't destroyed us completely. They want us to surrender or die.""
I shook my head and stared back at President Anderson. ""You're lying.""
""Are you sure?"" he asked. ""Do you have any proof of what you claim?""
I sighed again and looked away from him. ""You won't believe me if I tell you anyway. You're going to say it's all in my head.""
""All right,"" he replied, standing up from the table and putting his arms behind his back. ""Let us prove to you that this isn't all in your head, young man."" He turned to Professor Kuznetsov. ""Please ask him to leave this room while we prepare some samples for testing.""
Professor Kuznetsov nodded and got up from his chair, leaving us alone in the conference room. The president followed him out of the room, closing the door behind him, and turned around to face me again. ""I have no idea what you are talking about, but if you are saying these creatures have some connection with us, then it must be true."" He walked towards the windows overlooking the courtyard to one side of the room before stopping near a large cabinet against the wall.",1230,-0.14243903384561912,0.4191670866926897,-1.3583342662502667,0.6670371999529519,0.16296315196317207
101,R_DIYEG1Q8OTBQrUB,ACE_HOR_4,Horror,Ace of Spade,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had a large nose that looked like an elephant's trunk with two large nostrils. The mouth was small and thin. Its eyes were small, but they seemed to be staring straight through me. There was a long black hair covering its head. This wasn't just any old man. It was a demon! I screamed and ran downstairs. My parents came running as well, and my dad called 911. We all stayed together in our living room waiting for the police. They said someone would be here shortly.
It was only ten minutes later when the doorbell rang. I opened it to see the sheriff standing outside. He asked if he could come inside. As soon as he stepped foot inside, he fell to his knees and began screaming. He then grabbed my father by the shirt and started shaking him violently. All this time, I'm still sitting on the couch holding my mom's hand. After a few seconds, the sheriff calmed down and sat back in his chair.
""What happened?"" My mom asked. ""Is everything okay? Did something happen to you guys?""
""No,"" the sheriff replied. ""We're fine. We have another situation going on right now.""
My mom gave us a confused look and went upstairs to her bedroom. I followed after her and found the sheriff lying on the floor with a knife sticking out of his chest. My mother knelt next to him and pulled it out. Blood poured out of him as she held the wound closed with both hands. She looked at me and said, ""This isn't real. You must get up!"" Then, she pushed me off the bed and onto the floor.
She turned to the sheriff and said, ""Get up. Get up or we will die here today!"" He didn't move. She took one last glance around the house before she left. Everything disappeared except for myself. I was floating above the ground and watched the whole thing play out. Once the sheriff finally stood up, he became a monster too. He grabbed his wife by the neck and slammed her against the wall. He threw her across the room where she hit her head hard against a dresser. His body shook as he cried out. I wanted so badly to help them. But how could I? If I did, I'd end up dead.
The sheriff picked up a baseball bat and beat his wife repeatedly. Finally, he stopped moving. I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks. How could he do this? Why would he hurt such a beautiful woman? Tears streamed down my face as I floated closer to the ground. Soon, I was falling through space. A bright light appeared ahead. I reached out towards it as I felt my life slipping away. That's when I realized that I wasn't dying; I was being reborn.
My new life is far better than what I ever could've imagined. I live in a big house with many rooms. Each of them are filled with different people. Some are demons while others are angels. I can choose which ones I want to spend my time with. It's been almost five years since I was born. In that time, I've learned that not everyone is good. There are some who seek to take advantage of those who need them most. There are also those who are evil enough to kill their own family members without a second thought. Yet, I am lucky because I have the power to protect them. I am blessed enough to have a family that cares about me.
They say that the devil never sleeps. But I know he does. And he has plans to destroy everything that is good in this world. I hope someday I'll be strong enough to stop him once and for all. Until then, I'll continue protecting those who cannot fight for themselves. I'll continue fighting the battle of good versus evil. I'll keep trying to save lives even though sometimes it feels hopeless. For that reason alone, I believe that God sent me to this earth for a purpose. Whether it be to bring happiness or sadness, I don't really care. So long as I can make a difference, I'll stay on Earth and fight to the bitter end.

102,R_2s0BC4WdsPJj5dW,GEN_HF_10,High Fantasy,Genesis,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
The road led them past the lake then down a steep incline into the valley beyond where the river bent sharply before flowing away from it. There, a bridge had been built and a large building sat upon it. From this vantage point, one could see that the bridge was made of stone while the building was constructed of brick. It was a simple structure, lacking any ornamentation whatsoever. The walls were white-plastered and there were no windows visible on the first floor, making it look more like a fortress than an inn.
""I don't think we'll find anyone here,"" said Miral as she looked around cautiously. ""This place is certainly not what I expected.""
""That's because you're a princess. They tend to get things wrong when dealing with royalty. We'll have to ask around until someone can help us.""
They walked across the bridge and approached the building. No sooner had they set foot inside than a man appeared before them. He was dressed in red robes and he stood easily as tall as Kari. His long silver hair flowed behind him and his blue eyes seemed to pierce right through them.
""What can I do for you?"" asked the priest without preamble.
Miral turned to face him. ""We need passage eastward.""
The priest nodded. ""Why do you want to go so far? Are you pilgrims heading to the holy city of Eathinian?""
""No, we are headed farther east to the land of the Dragon King.""
""Hmm…"" the priest mused. ""The only way to get there is to journey by boat along the Great Ocean. There is a port town on the southern edge of the sea called Olandis. From there, you will likely have to take a ship down the coast to Othir, which lies in the center of the continent. Once you reach the city, you should look for an inn or tavern known as The Dragon's Claw. Tell them that the royal family sent you and they will provide you with the best accommodations. For a price, of course.""
Kari eyed the priest carefully. ""And why would you know this?""
""My order has ties to the king. I am bound to serve him in whatever capacity he requires.""
""But not as a spy, I hope,"" Kari said.
""Of course not!"" the priest exclaimed. ""We have no interest in spying on your kingdom. All we wish to do is offer our services to those who require them. You may rest assured that if you stay at The Dragon's Claw, you'll receive the utmost discretion. Good day, Princess Miral.""
With that, he bowed once again and vanished back into the building. Miral looked uncertainly toward Kari, and she gave her a reassuring smile. ""He seemed nice enough.""
""Well, we have to trust him somehow,"" Miral replied.
""It seems odd to me that a place like this exists in a world full of dragons,"" Kari noted. ""Doesn't the dragonkin live on the other side of the ocean?""
""Yes, but there are many more humans than there are dragons,"" Miral explained. ""There is also the fact that humans seem to have a connection with the dragons, even though they don't live in the same place. I suppose there might be some sort of mystical bond between them that I'm just too ignorant to understand. Anyway, I've heard stories about the Dragon Kings. Some say they're really dragons themselves, while others suggest that they're simply human kings pretending to be something different in order to fool people. Either way, they're supposed to be very powerful.""
""Sounds like you've done a lot of research on them,"" Kari commented.
Miral shrugged. ""Maybe a little bit. But this is all I know. If we're going to get to Olandis, we'll have to find transportation soon. Do you think we can afford to stay here tonight, or will it cost us?""
Kari pulled out a few coins and counted them. She had brought quite a bit of gold with her from the North, and she'd sold off most of it in Citaria to fund the trip south. Her stash remained, however, and she knew that it would be enough to keep them afloat for a time. She handed Miral a couple of coins and told her to pay for their lodging if they decided to sleep here.
""Let's see what we can learn,"" Kari said. ""If we decide to spend the night here, perhaps we'll have more luck asking around.""
""You think we should stay here, then?""
""I'm not sure,"" Kari admitted. ""We haven't seen any other people and I don't like the feeling I get from this place.""
They went upstairs and found a room on the second floor. It was furnished with a bed and a table with chairs, both of which were made of wood rather than cloth or leather. The room itself was simple, but clean and well kept. As they settled in, Miral turned to Kari. ""Do you believe in spirits?""
""Not particularly,"" Kari said.
""Oh, I thought you might like to hear my story.""
Kari smiled. ""Go ahead.""
""While I was in the capital, I met someone who claimed to have seen a ghost. He said he didn't know whether the spirit was male or female, and that it was wrapped in chains and dragging them along. It came to him while he was walking near the palace.""
""It sounds like a nightmare,"" Kari said. ""Are you sure there wasn't anything else about it?""
""Well, he claimed that it took the form of a woman, but that she was wearing armor, and the armor was covered in blood. She was carrying a sword and shield, and she had no head. I didn't want to be rude and ask how the man knew all this, but it sounded very strange indeed. And it got worse. Apparently, the ghost was watching him from a distance while he talked to a friend and when he turned to leave, it grabbed hold of his leg and dragged him into the shadows. That's when the man ran away and tried to tell everyone what happened, but no one believed him.""
""Did you ever meet this man again?""
""No, but I did ask if I could see the place where it happened. It's a small alleyway, barely wide enough for a carriage to pass through. It's right beside the palace, but few people walk by it. Well, he showed me and it was empty. I don't know what to make of it. I mean, the man's story sounds incredible, but I never saw anything like that myself. Then again, I suppose I wouldn't. There aren't many places in the capital that I don't know of. Maybe it's nothing and maybe it isn't.""
""Perhaps you should consider it a warning,"" Kari suggested.",1210,0.35024296638506985,0.9486897339224314,-0.061541559770696544,-0.14314142751066172,-0.0588553381052264
103,R_pSJLm0dzHTaqVXj,BAS_HOR_3,Horror,Basic Coherence,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my reflection; it was someone else's. The person had black hair that was cut short in an almost military style, and their skin was pale like mine but with a darker tone. They wore a white dress shirt and dark pants.
""Who are you?"" I asked them as they stared back at me through the mirror. ""What do you want?""
The figure didn't say anything. Instead, he just continued staring at me for what seemed like hours before finally turning away. He then began walking towards the door. I followed him and watched as he opened it. There were two other figures standing outside. One was tall and thin while the other was shorter and rounder. Both of them had long hair and wore similar clothes to the one who'd been inside the mirror.
""You're not supposed to be here,"" said the man with the black hair. His voice sounded familiar somehow.
""We know,"" answered the woman with the longer hair. She spoke with a heavy accent. ""That is why we came.""
""Why would you do that? You shouldn't have done this. We could've found another way.""
""It was our only option,"" replied the taller woman.
""Well, now we don't have any options left. What will we do now?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""We'll find a way to get rid of them,"" said the woman with the heavier accent.
""How?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""By killing them,"" she told him. ""Kill them all so no one can tell us apart.""
""But how?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""We'll figure something out,"" said the woman with the heavier accent. ""Just make sure you kill them all. That's the only way we can stay alive.""
""Yes, ma'am,"" said the man with the black hair.
He closed the door behind him and left. As soon as the door shut, I ran to the window and saw him walk down the stairs and head out of sight. Then I turned around and looked at the mirror. I knew I couldn't let them escape. If they did, then they'd go after everyone else. I had to stop them before they could hurt anyone else.
I grabbed my knife from my nightstand and headed back to the mirror. This time when I entered, I didn't see anything except darkness. I reached out with my hand and felt nothing. I tried to turn on the light switch next to the mirror but it wouldn't work. I was trapped in the mirror with nowhere to run.
I started to panic but then I remembered the power button on my phone. I pulled it out of my pocket and pressed it. The screen lit up and I quickly typed in the number for 911. A few seconds later, I heard sirens outside. I waited until the police arrived and then stepped out of the mirror.
When the police officers entered the room, they immediately noticed the broken mirror and the blood splattered across the wall. They also saw the bodies lying on the floor. After taking pictures of everything, they took me to a cell where I stayed for three days. During that time, I was questioned by several detectives but none of them ever figured out who I really was or what happened.
After those three days, I was released without being charged with anything. My parents were relieved to see me home safe. However, I still had no idea who I was or how I got there. I decided to return to school because I needed to figure things out.
As I walked to my locker, I bumped into someone. I looked up and saw the girl from the mirror. Her face was covered by her hands. When she removed them, I realized it was her.
""Hi,"" she said.
""Hello,"" I replied.
She smiled and held out her hand. ""My name is Marie.""
""Nice to meet you, Marie,"" I said as I shook her hand. ""I'm Jason.""
""So, you're the one who broke the mirror,"" she said.
""Yeah,"" I responded.
""And you killed the people who were trying to take me away,"" she added.
""Yes, I did,"" I told her.
""Thank you,"" she said. ""You saved my life.""
""No problem,"" I replied.
Marie then looked down at her feet and said, ""I need your help.""
""With what?"" I asked.
""To save the world,"" she explained.
""Save the world?"" I repeated.
""Yes, Jason,"" she said. ""This is the last time I'm going to ask you. Please help me.""
""Okay, I'll try,"" I told her.
""Thank you,"" she said.
""Let's start by finding out who you are,"" I suggested.
""All right,"" she agreed.
We went to the library and spent the rest of the day researching. We read about the history of the mirror and the people who used it. The more we learned, the more confused we became. None of it made sense.
""We should probably talk to someone who knows about these mirrors,"" I said.
""Like who?"" asked Marie.
""Maybe the professor,"" I suggested.
""Professor Jones?"" she asked.
""That's the one,"" I confirmed.
""Do you think he'll believe us?"" she wondered.
""Probably not,"" I admitted. ""But we have to try. Besides, maybe he can tell us who you really are.""
""Okay,"" she said.
We went to his office and knocked on the door. He opened it and looked surprised to see us.
""Jason, what a surprise,"" he said. ""Is everything okay?""
""We wanted to ask you some questions,"" I said.
""Of course,"" he replied. ""Come in and sit down. I'll get us some coffee.""
We sat down and he handed us each a cup of coffee.
""So, what can I do for you today?"" he asked.
""We were wondering if you could tell us anything about the mirror,"" I explained.
""Oh, yes,"" he said. ""I remember it well. It was quite the mystery back in the day. The first person who discovered it was a young girl named Mary. She was living alone in the forest when she came across the mirror. She was very curious so she tried using it. To her amazement, it worked.",1078,-0.05021064500471199,0.12019701823335875,1.805619335869269,0.9518233580275285,0.11121700294405001
104,R_3EMWydPibvRYtOt,OUR_HSF_1,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to see President Hernandez today. I had just spent five years trying to stop the war he was waging against humanity. But there was no point in putting off what needed doing. So I made my way toward the presidential offices.
When I stepped inside the building I went straight up to the security guard stationed at the door, who nodded at me. He gave me the all clear to go on in. The interior was just like any other government office; it felt cold and sterile. When I arrived at the receptionist desk she smiled at me.
""Good morning, Mr. Stone,"" she said cheerfully, taking the envelope. She tore it open and pulled out a small piece of paper that read: ""See me in my office as soon as you can."" As she handed the note to me I could see her eyebrows lift slightly at the handwriting on the outside of the envelope.
She handed it to me and looked at me questioningly. ""Dr. Sato said this was for you."" I shrugged and gave her a tight smile. ""I suppose so. Thanks."" I turned away from her to get to President Hernandez's office.
There were several people in the outer waiting area when I got to the president's office. Most of them were tourists and politicians with their entourages. There were also several news cameras lined up against one wall. As I approached the receptionist she stepped out from behind her counter and moved to block my path.
""Mr. Stone, we've been informed by the Secret Service that you are not to enter the president's office today,"" she said, looking me up and down with an assessing expression. ""You have a meeting scheduled with General Lea."" I sighed and nodded before turning around and walking back through the door that led outside. The Secret Service men saw me and stepped in front of me to prevent me from entering the waiting area again.
""Sir, you're not going to get in,"" said one of the men in uniform. ""I'm afraid you'll just have to wait here. We can't let anyone pass in or out of the president's office."" He took his hand off his holster as he spoke. I stopped and stared at him.
""So...you won't let me meet with the president?"" I asked the man. I didn't raise my voice but I could tell by the way the Secret Service agents bristled at my words that they weren't happy about it.
""Sir, it would be better if you waited for the next group,"" said the second agent. His tone was clearly patronizing and condescending. ""You shouldn't cause any trouble. You are simply too famous."" He chuckled. ""If you'd like to see President Hernandez, please contact the office directly."" I stepped forward and grabbed the arm of the agent who was speaking to me, pulling him close to my face. ""Fuck you, man. Don't you think it's time to let me in?"" I growled. The men behind me began to form a circle around me to try and keep me away from the agents, who were still smiling.
""Sir, I don't think the president will want to meet with you,"" said the man. I released his arm and glared at him. ""This is not your decision, sir. It's the president's."" I shook my head and stepped back. ""All right, then. Enjoy your day, Mr. Stone. Thank you for coming in."" I turned around and walked toward my waiting car.
There were several news reporters waiting for me outside as soon as I got to my car. I ignored them and climbed inside. I drove away from the building, heading north and out of town toward the mountains. I needed to get clear of the city for a while; it was too much for me to handle.
When I arrived at the house I rented I called Dr. Sato and told her that I wasn't going to be able to make our meeting. She said she'd tell the president. Then she hung up on me. I knew it was only a matter of time before he sent an angry message to my cell phone. I didn't even bother looking at it; I just put it in a drawer and got to work.
I spent most of the afternoon working on the computer, writing code for new software. It wasn't enough to change the outcome of things but I knew it would make a difference if I could use the code to help guide our people to safety. But no matter how hard I tried, nothing seemed to work. My mind kept circling back to what it had felt like to see my father die before my eyes. I hadn't been able to save him and it haunted me.
When night fell I was exhausted. I took a shower and ate dinner alone. I was still trying to figure out the best way to distribute the code I had created. The president was wrong; I was not simply ""too famous."" But I was also powerless against him. And there was nothing I could do to change that.
The next morning I got out of bed early and headed to the lab in hopes of getting some more work done. I was feeling much better about the situation by the time I arrived. I didn't know what the next step was but I figured I would figure something out. After all, the president wasn't going to stop me from doing anything I wanted, right?
As I walked into the lab a man sat on one of the sofas, staring at me. I blinked in surprise and then realized that it was Jason. He had his arm around a pretty young blonde. ""Hey, Stone,"" he said, waving to me. ""How've you been?""
""Uh, good, Jason. How's things?""
He smiled. ""Good. I'm just here to see Dr. Sato.""
""Oh, I'm not here,"" I replied. ""I'm sorry, Jason."" I tried to turn away to walk toward the door but Jason grabbed my arm.
""Come on, man,"" he said. ""Let's have a drink."" He put his hand on my shoulder to lead me toward the door. The girl looked up at me with a smile and winked. She reached out for my hand and I pulled back, looking down at her.
""Jason, let go of me,"" I demanded.
""Why? It's only going to be a drink or two."" Jason gave me a pained look and pulled on my arm again. ""Come on, man, don't get so weird about this."" I pulled away from him and walked toward the door. The girl grabbed my arm but Jason stepped between us.
""Stop it, Jason,"" he growled. He shoved Jason backward, making him stumble to the ground. When he fell he let out a yell. The girl started crying. I stood there stunned. I turned to face Jason. His face was red with rage.",1227,0.25408513298319835,0.1173031641943659,1.0320470901567105,1.7382787171787766,-0.5446426133926674
105,R_22JhMNbwFLXu737,GEN_HR_3,Historical Romance,Genesis,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. A man had brought her there; she wore his ring on her finger. The man left shortly after they arrived.
She stared around the room with an air of indifference—but it wasn't true. There were tears glittering in those dark eyes that gazed out over the crowded room. She wasn't alone, but no one else mattered to her as much as the man who'd left her behind.
It took him a moment to recognize the woman, but once he did, he knew her instantly. Her hair was a shade lighter than when he'd last seen her, but it was still black as night, falling down her back in thick waves. He could see the long lines of her body beneath the simple robe she wore. Though she appeared oblivious to what was going on around her, she wasn't quite so indifferent.
He watched her from the shadows and wondered if she would remember him. It had been years since their last meeting, but he knew she wouldn't forget him so soon.
A second later, she looked up and met his gaze. Her smile was tentative, shy—and familiar. As though it belonged to someone else.
""You,"" she said softly. ""I thought you were dead.""
He didn't answer, not wanting to break her fragile happiness with the truth. But he couldn't help himself. Before he could stop himself, he stepped forward, closing the distance between them as gently as possible.
Her mouth parted, as if she wanted to speak, but nothing came out. Instead, her hand rose to touch his cheek.
And then she crumpled, falling straight into his arms.
He caught her easily, holding her tightly against his chest until her sobs quieted. When the worst of it passed, he carried her out of the tavern and away from the city's busy streets before setting her down under a tree in the center of the small clearing.
""Why did you leave me?"" she asked, staring up at him with huge eyes.
""I don't know,"" he told her honestly.
Her shoulders slumped slightly, and she pulled herself together, wiping at her tears. ""I'm sorry for this,"" she said, pressing her hands to her cheeks.
She was beautiful, with skin as pale as milk and lips that begged to be kissed. And yet, even with all that, he found it hard to look directly at her. She reminded him too much of the past, of everything he'd lost.
""Don't apologize. I wish things had turned out differently.""
""How can you say that? You abandoned me.""
""No. Not exactly. I left because your father needed my help. I couldn't stay any longer without doing something about him. He was evil, and he would have destroyed you. I had to make sure you were safe.""
She nodded, a small smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. ""Did you find him?""
""Yes, but it wasn't easy.""
""What happened to him?""
He hesitated, wondering how much to tell her. She deserved to know, but he wished she didn't need to hear it. Still, he owed her the truth.
""The king killed him.""
Her smile faltered, and she started crying again. ""Oh, no! Is that why you're here now?""
""Yes, but—""
She pressed her fingers to his lips. ""Please don't lie to me. What happened? Did he die horribly?""
His heart clenched painfully at the memory of the old king dying in agony, but he forced himself to say it aloud. ""I won't lie to you. He died screaming. His screams echoed through the castle for hours, and everyone heard them. In the end, there was nothing left of him but ashes.""
""That's terrible!""
He nodded, unable to meet her gaze.
""But why are you telling me this?"" she asked, confused. ""Aren't you happy that he's gone? Why do you sound so sad?""
He released her hands and sighed. ""Because I loved him. He was my friend. My mentor. One day, I will mourn him.""
She studied him for a long while and then shrugged. ""Well, whatever. That doesn't mean anything anymore.""
""It means more than you realize,"" he said, looking away.
She grabbed his arm. ""What?""
""Nothing. I must go.""
She followed him back toward the tavern, and he glanced around suspiciously. Had anyone noticed where they had disappeared to? Would it be better for both of them if they pretended nothing had happened?
As he neared the door, a shadow fell across him, blocking the light from the lanterns inside the building. He looked up to find the guard who had helped him escape the king's dungeons.
""Have you seen a young woman pass by?""
""Yes. She was in here earlier today."" He gestured vaguely in the direction of the kitchen. ""But she left before I got here. I haven't seen her since.""
The guard nodded, and the two men made their way in that direction.
""What was your name again?"" he asked.
""Evan.""
""Thank you, Evan,"" he said. ""We'll catch up with her soon enough.""
The guard smiled and gave him a wink before disappearing into the kitchen.
""Are you going to tell me why you're really here?"" she asked as he led her back outside.
He stopped, turned to look at her, and then shook his head. ""I can't. Not yet.""
""Why not?""
""Because I want to.""
She frowned, but for the first time since he'd seen her, she seemed to believe him. ""All right,"" she said, turning away.
He caught her hand and held it tight. ""Wait,"" he whispered.
She paused, glancing back at him. ""What?""
""Come with me.""
She didn't question him further or ask where they were going. Instead, she let him lead her into the woods.
They walked for miles without speaking, and when they finally reached a small cave overlooking the water, he knew it was the perfect place to talk.
""Do you know why I'm here?"" he asked, standing at the edge of the cliff and gazing out over the ocean.
She shrugged. ""I thought maybe you were trying to get revenge.""
""No,"" he said quickly. ""I've already done that. Revenge is pointless. I promised myself that I would never do such a thing again.""
""So what are you doing?",1069,1.546519670016684,1.4879182718208643,-0.3251588245210698,1.700467604598457,1.9130687878594368
106,R_3qWF2p11vJp2T8h,BAS_HSF_1,Hard Sci-Fi,Basic Coherence,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature had risen considerably since yesterday, when it'd been below freezing outside.
It wasn't uncommon for me to be called upon by the president, but today's meeting would be different than any other time I'd met with him before. Today, he wanted to talk about our plans for the future. He knew what I thought about the situation; he just didn't want anyone else to know yet. That meant only three people were going to be present at the meeting: myself, the president, and Dr. Sato.
The president's office was located in a large white building near the center of the city. We entered through its front doors and walked down a long hallway until we reached one of many elevators. When it opened up, we stepped inside and rode it all the way to the top floor. Once there, we exited the elevator and went straight toward another set of double glass doors. As soon as they slid open, we walked into the president's private office.
President Taggart sat behind his desk, looking out at us with a serious expression on his face. His hands rested on the edge of his desk, and his eyes seemed to be focused somewhere far away. ""You've done well so far,"" he began after a moment of silence. ""But now is not the time to rest on your laurels. There are still more problems to solve.""
""Yes sir,"" I replied. ""We're working hard every day to find solutions.""
""I'm aware of that,"" President Taggart answered. ""However, we need to take things a step further. You'll be given additional resources to continue your work, and I expect you to make good use of them. If we don't get these problems solved, then we may never leave this planet again.""
I nodded in agreement. ""Understood.""
""Good,"" he said, standing up from his chair. ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some meetings to attend to. Dr. Sato will show you to your new offices while I'm gone."" He turned around and left the room without waiting for a response.
Dr. Sato led us out of the office and back down the hall. She stopped in front of a door and handed me a key card. ""This should get you into the building. Just go right past the receptionist and head upstairs. Room 203 is where you'll be staying. Your assistant has already been assigned to you, and she'll be showing you how everything works once you arrive.""
""Thank you,"" I said.
She smiled. ""Don't mention it. Now, I must return to my duties. Have a nice day!"" With that, she turned and headed off down the hallway.
After leaving Dr. Sato, I made my way across the lobby and into the elevator. When the doors opened up, I stepped inside and pressed the button for the third floor. After a few seconds, the doors closed, and the elevator started moving upward. I looked at the numbers above the doors as they counted upwards, watching the digital display count up to the top floor.
When the doors opened up, I stepped out onto a large hallway. A sign hanging next to the entrance read ""Office of the President."" At the end of the hall, I saw two men dressed in black suits talking to each other. They both had dark hair and wore sunglasses even though it was daytime. One of the men held a briefcase, and the other man had a tablet computer in his hand.
As I approached, the man with the tablet computer turned around and gave me a nod. ""Hello, Mr. Smith,"" he said. ""Welcome to the office.""
""Thanks,"" I replied. ""I appreciate the warm welcome.""
""Not a problem,"" he responded. ""Just doing our job.""
I nodded and continued walking down the hallway until I reached a set of double glass doors. I pushed one of them open and walked inside. Inside the room was a woman sitting behind a large wooden desk. Her short blonde hair was neatly combed, and she was wearing a blue business suit.
""Mr. Smith?"" she asked.
I nodded. ""That's me.""
""Please, have a seat,"" she said, gesturing to one of the chairs in front of her desk. I sat down and waited for her to finish typing something on her computer.
""So, you're the new guy,"" she said, finally looking up from the keyboard and giving me a smile. ""How do you like it so far?""
""It's been pretty great so far,"" I replied. ""Everyone's been very welcoming.""
""Excellent,"" she said. ""I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's get you set up.""
She got up from her chair and walked over to a cabinet that was built into the wall. She pulled out a small box and placed it on the table in front of me. ""This is your badge,"" she said, holding it up for me to see. ""You'll need this to access most areas of the building, including your office. You can also use it to get into your apartment.""
""Oh, okay,"" I said, taking the badge and placing it in my pocket. ""Where exactly am I supposed to put this thing? My pockets are full of stuff already.""
""There's a drawer under the table,"" she answered. ""If you'll look there, you'll find a small metal plate. Place the badge on top of it, and it'll lock in place.""
I did as she told me and watched as the badge locked itself into place. ""Okay, thanks,"" I said, getting up from the chair and walking over to the cabinet.
""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" she asked.
""No, that's it,"" I said. ""I think I'm good to go.""
""Great,"" she said. ""Well, I'll let you get settled in. If you need anything, just give me a call.""
With that, she turned around and left the room. I picked up the box and carried it over to the cabinet, placing it inside the drawer and closing the door. Then, I walked over to the window and looked out at the view of the city.
I was in the middle of the city, surrounded by buildings and people. The windows were tinted slightly, blocking out the sunlight. I could see the tops of the tall buildings poking out from behind the clouds. In the distance, I saw a large dome-shaped structure. It was probably the science facility that we used to study the planet's environment.
I glanced down at the badge in my pocket, remembering the conversation I'd had with Dr. Sato earlier.",1153,0.29175229102994193,-0.5956344800018388,-0.9069688027611214,-0.6888094544592964,0.3529469798876114

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The summer solstice had just passed, but even so, it would be dark by nightfall again once the winter solstice came around.
I'd been living in the same small apartment for about two years now. My first few months here had been difficult enough, trying to adjust to life on the surface of another world. But after a while, I found myself becoming accustomed to how things worked here. And now that I had my own place, I didn't feel as much like a visitor or a tourist anymore.
The city of Deimos had grown rapidly in recent years, almost doubling its population since I arrived. Most people were still making their homes inside the crater rim, which was where most of the permanent structures existed. But there were also several large buildings erected along the coast, providing housing for many of the temporary workers who worked outside the walls.
Despite the growing population, the majority of people still lived within the crater. There were some exceptions, though. Some families had chosen to live elsewhere in the country rather than in the city itself. They liked having a little more space to themselves without needing to drive hours away to get it.
But wherever they chose to live, most people agreed that Deimos was a great place to call home. This was Mars, after all, and nothing else quite compared to it. After only a few weeks, I'd become completely comfortable with how the city looked. Even walking down the street, I could tell exactly what building someone was living in based on the color of the paint and the style of the window frames.
I walked past a construction site to get to the main avenue running through town. As I did, I saw a couple of men working on a new high-rise building. One of them was a man named Dominguez. He had been one of my classmates when I first arrived at the University of Mars, back before he'd left to join a company that was constructing a new business complex out near the equator. We hadn't seen each other in nearly a decade, but we exchanged brief greetings as we passed.
I continued on, pausing for a moment at the end of the road, then turned right onto the next one. Before long, I reached the University of Mars' administration building. I stepped inside, taking a seat in the waiting room. A few minutes later, I heard the door open behind me and I turned to see Dr. Sato enter. She smiled at me, then followed me through the doors and into the president's office.
""Hey,"" said President Sirocco as she sat down across from us. I nodded slightly, remembering the last time I'd met with him in person. Back then, he had been serving his second term as president of the university. Now, he was up for re-election.
""Hello, Mr. President,"" I replied. ""Thank you for seeing me today.""
He shook his head. ""You don't need to thank me,"" he told me. ""I'm glad to help if I can.""
""How's the campaign going?"" I asked.
President Sirocco smiled. ""It's not too bad,"" he explained. ""There are always a few problems here and there, but overall things seem to be going well.""
We chatted for a little while longer before I got to the reason I had come to see him. I handed him the letter from the president. ""This is a request for your candidacy to run for election to the position of chancellor,"" I explained.
He read over the contents quickly, smiling. ""Well, it looks like I won't have any trouble getting elected this year, then!""
I laughed. ""Yeah, I guess not.""
He stood up, clapping me on the shoulder. ""And good luck, Lucas! If you win, I'll look forward to working with you.""
I smiled back. ""Thanks, sir.""
""Come back and visit whenever you want,"" he added.
I nodded. ""Of course. You know where to find me.""
With that, we parted ways. I headed back towards my apartment, feeling the warmth of the day filling me with excitement. The race for chancellor had just started, and I knew there would be plenty of work ahead in the coming months. But first, I had to finish the research that I was currently working on.
I was about halfway to my building when I noticed something strange. It was far too hot for this time of year. So I stopped in my tracks and looked around. No one was in sight. But I still sensed something out of place. Something that shouldn't be there.
""Who's there?"" I called out.
No response. Just silence. I moved closer to the object, reaching out to touch it. Heat radiated off of it, but instead of being warm to the touch, it felt cool. Almost cold. As I brought my hand close, I realized what it was. A stone.
A statue. Standing in the middle of the pavement. I stared at it for a moment, confused, before realizing that there wasn't anyone nearby. Not in the immediate vicinity, anyway. I bent down and picked it up.
It was made of rock, smooth and white. It was shaped like a human, but there was something…off about it. Its face was distorted somehow. Like it was covered with a thin layer of mud or clay. Then I saw the words carved into the front of the statue.
""Help me.""
I held the statue in my hands, staring at it. It was too dark to make out anything else. But I didn't need to see the rest of it to know what it was supposed to represent. This was a representation of me. Of my face.
I looked up, looking around for any sign of who might have placed it there. But the area was empty. It was silent. There was no one around to explain what was happening.
For the first time, I began to feel afraid.
Then I heard footsteps. Someone approaching. Walking towards me. In the darkness.
I turned, facing the sound. Slowly. The figure was getting closer. Closer. I couldn't make out any details in the dim light. All I could hear was the soft crunching of the stones beneath their feet.
I ran. I rushed towards my apartment, ignoring the warning signs. I unlocked the door and slammed it shut behind me. And then I locked it.
I waited there, breathing heavily, until I heard the footsteps pass by. I listened intently, hoping to hear them return. But all I could hear was the sound of the wind blowing against the windows.
Slowly, I let out a breath. ""Okay,"" I whispered to myself. ""That's it.""
My apartment was completely dark. But I didn't turn on the lights. Instead, I closed my eyes and focused on the statue in my hands.",1205,-0.49151867393770904,0.12290418985904072,-0.8149001458234116,0.9063464432731304,-0.5243092279798635
108,R_A566tRD3BDw2sdb,LOW_HR_9,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been working hard to get a little rest before the end of his shift; it was only three hours left before closing time, but she'd somehow managed to keep him awake for them all. The last thing he'd wanted was more trouble after he'd been up half the night with the other customers complaining about being served rotten ale by some lazy bastard who couldn't be bothered to check if it was drinkable or not.
And then she had come along.
He watched as she took a seat at the table opposite of him. There were two others there too, but they seemed so small compared to her. A tall man and a short woman, neither particularly pretty or interesting-looking, but they certainly didn't have much personality to them. They might've looked good together in bed, maybe even better than he and his girlfriend, but that was about it.
She on the other hand...
Her hair was a dark blue color, which made sense since she'd obviously just walked out from a cold ocean. Her skin was also very pale, probably because she didn't see any sun during most of the year. And yet despite this, her figure looked very nice, especially the shape of her ass under those tight black pants she wore. Even though she wasn't wearing any underwear beneath them, he could still make out the outline of her pussy clearly through the fabric. It was quite tempting, actually, and his cock started to grow as he stared at her.
It was then when she turned around and looked at him directly in the eyes. His first impression was that she was angry at him. But then he noticed the way she looked at him. She was staring at him as though she were trying to memorize everything about him. Then, when he realized what exactly she was doing, his mouth went dry, and he felt something warm trickling down his legs.
She's studying me...
""What are you looking at?""
His voice sounded strange in his ears; it seemed like a whisper even though he hadn't whispered anything at all. Yet the other patrons didn't seem to notice any strange sounds coming from the man sitting at the table. If anything, they kept their focus mostly on their drinks and food rather than paying attention to him.
The girl standing in front of him simply smiled and said nothing. Instead she reached up and took a small bag of coins out of her pocket. This seemed to amuse her and she began to laugh. Then suddenly she leaned forward and placed a kiss on his cheek. As she did this she slipped the bag of coins right between her breasts, making sure he would see every bit of it.
He tried to say something, but nothing came out. All he managed to do was stare at her dumbly as she turned around and left the tavern without another word.
Then he heard the clinking sound of metal hitting the floor. He followed the noise until he found himself looking up at her. She'd dropped a gold coin and it had rolled over to him. Without thinking he bent down and picked it up, but then he realized how ridiculous the gesture was. It was just a piece of copper or bronze, and yet he couldn't help but feel proud holding it in his hands. And that wasn't all, either. She seemed happy when he did that.
As if I'm a servant...
He knew that was stupid. After all, who cared whether he got a reward or not? And yet for some reason, he didn't want to give it back to her. No, instead he decided that the best thing would be to ask her why she gave him something so expensive. Maybe she wanted him to go away because he was bothering her, or maybe there was a problem with one of the people she'd brought there before him. Either way, he had a feeling that he'd regret it later if he didn't try to find out what her intentions were.
After giving her one last look, he left the tavern and headed straight for her home. He knew the general direction she lived in from the directions she gave him earlier in the day, but he needed to know exactly how far away it was in order to make his plan work. Once he arrived he knocked on the door several times, but there was no response.
This doesn't make any sense...
She had given him specific instructions on where to go and what to do when he found her house, so there shouldn't be any problem. Still, he waited outside for quite a while before finally opening the door and walking inside. There was no one inside except for him, and that meant he should have been able to talk to her immediately. Yet she didn't appear, so he started looking around the house for clues about why that was.
There were books all over the place, as well as a variety of musical instruments, but that didn't explain why she wouldn't respond to him. In fact, it seemed almost like she was avoiding him. At least, that's what it looked like to him. Then he noticed a set of stairs leading up to the second floor. Perhaps she was upstairs? That seemed plausible, but he still couldn't understand why she didn't answer his knocks.
He climbed the stairs and entered a room on the second floor. There were some clothes scattered throughout the room, along with various personal belongings, but none of them seemed like they were hers. Then he noticed something else, too. A book with a leather cover lying open on one of the beds. And it had her name written on it.
I know this...
He picked it up and looked at it closely. Then, after a brief moment of hesitation, he opened it and saw a picture of the woman standing on a beach. It was the same woman as she'd seen earlier that morning. She was wearing the same clothes, but this time she had her long hair flowing freely down her back. She looked very beautiful, even though it wasn't really clear what happened in the background. All he saw was a small sailboat in the distance.
She's here...
He quickly closed the book and hurried down the stairs, but as soon as he stepped outside, he felt his heart skip a beat. There was a large ship in the harbor with a crew loading barrels onto it. There were men everywhere, but none of them paid any attention to him. And yet, once he noticed that, he also noticed something else. The crewmen weren't wearing uniforms, and yet they all wore swords and daggers at their waist. None of them was armed with anything else. It was obvious to him that they were pirates.
Pirates...
The words ""pirate"" and ""mermaid"" didn't belong in the same sentence together, but there was no doubting it now. That was definitely her ship, and judging by the size of it she must've been the captain.
But how is she doing this?
It didn't make any sense. How could someone be so strong yet so helpless at the same time? How could anyone live their life like that and not become depressed or anxious all the time?",1272,-0.5408900686014989,-0.2736798147364412,0.22802377373043003,0.3844536537499236,-0.9183155304355319
109,R_9HJIDDjJBwUqgYV,FAN_HF_3,High Fantasy,Fandango,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It must have been built in the last few months,"" said Elina. She pointed to two wooden poles that had been pushed into the ground as if to mark the location of some long-forgotten village. The river was low enough to wade across. ""I'm surprised anyone would choose to live here.""
""They probably came because it was the closest place to take shelter during these storms,"" he replied.
He followed her gaze as she stared down into the shallow water. ""I wonder what happened to them?""
She was quiet for a moment, then gave him an understanding nod. ""I can understand your wanting to go down there to see... what's left of them.""
""I don't think I'll find anything, Elina. It looks as though it has been abandoned long ago.""
""I would like you to come anyway. Just so we know, yes?""
He nodded, and she put her hand on his arm and together they made their way across the river. They walked quietly past the village, making sure not to make a sound until they were well on their way back the way they had come.
""There are several buildings over there,"" said Elina, pointing to one of the towers.
Sasha took her hand again to steady himself, then nodded. ""I remember seeing that. That would be the keep. You could tell by the roof.""
""And that one over there,"" she added, motioning toward another building, ""is where the villagers lived.""
""There're a lot more people than I thought would have lived there.""
Elina shrugged. ""It's not like there's much else to do around here. Besides, it wasn't exactly a thriving community; only about twenty souls lived there.""
""I'm still amazed they managed to build this place in such a remote location,"" Sasha said as they continued to walk in silence between the towers. The valley was lush and green, filled with plants that he didn't recognize, but he'd never been anywhere near this part of the world before. He hadn't even known that villages existed at all here along the River Tethys.
""I'm not so sure we should be exploring down there, Sasha,"" Elina said when he stopped, turning to look at him.
Sasha turned back toward the valley. ""I thought you wanted to see what was down there? I would have gone by myself had it meant we would have to leave right away.""
She shook her head. ""No, that's not what I mean. It's just that..."" She looked around, then motioned toward one of the towers. ""That's where the villagers would have gone to hide from the storms, right?""
Sasha nodded. ""Yes. I'm sure of it.""
""Well, then I suppose it won't hurt to check it out. At least we might get a better idea of what happened to them."" She stepped away from him, then began to pick her way down into the valley.
Sasha quickly followed, and they walked along the edge of the river for a few minutes before Elina stopped and looked around, trying to figure out where exactly the settlement had once stood. As far as he could tell, they were alone. No movement or signs of any other living creature. He glanced down at his hand, finding it shaking slightly from the cold.
""Are you scared?"" she asked, noticing his reaction.
Sasha shook his head. ""Not particularly. If you are.""
Elina let out a laugh. ""I'm not. I want to see what happened to our people.""
""I'm not going to go down there, Elina.""
""You don't have to, Sasha. I'm doing fine without you.""
Before he could respond, she had disappeared into the thick vegetation, and Sasha watched her as she slowly moved deeper into the valley. When he was certain that she would not return anytime soon, he went over to the nearest tower and climbed up onto the roof. From there, he could follow her movements with ease.
After about ten minutes of searching, Elina finally stopped and turned to face him. She had reached a walled enclosure that he assumed was once a large house. A massive tree had grown in front of it, and branches covered the walls and roof.
""I thought this was where the villagers would have built their shelter,"" said Sasha, walking forward and looking down into the clearing around the tree.
""You're not wrong,"" Elina replied. ""Look at those roots. They must have brought it here to protect themselves.""
""What's inside?"" asked Sasha.
Elina stepped through the opening and began to make her way into the darkness inside. Before he could follow, she paused. ""Do you hear that? It sounds like...""
Sasha listened intently, but all he could hear was the river flowing. He heard no other noises.
""It's nothing,"" she said after a few moments. She went deeper into the house and returned a minute later.
""I found a chest in one of the rooms,"" she said.
""A chest?""
""Yes. But it's locked.""
Sasha frowned. ""Didn't they leave behind any keys?""
""They did. There was one hanging on the wall over there."" She pointed to the opposite wall of the room, and Sasha could see what appeared to be a key leaning against the wood. The only problem was that there was something else blocking it.
""Can you reach it?"" Sasha asked.
""I don't think so,"" she replied, and the smile that crossed her lips at his question told him that she was teasing him.
""Why am I not surprised? Let me give it a try. You're too short.""
Elina rolled her eyes but didn't say anything as he went over to the key and pulled it closer to him. It was a simple hook, and only two feet long, but just as he was about to grab hold of it, he realized he didn't have enough length to reach it.
""You're right,"" he said, reaching toward her again. ""We need to use your spear to reach it.""
Elina laughed. ""That would be fun.""
""Let's hope they left us something for protection against the monsters."" Sasha took a deep breath and stretched his arms straight out as he tried to reach the key. ""Come on, Elina. Help me stretch.""
""You're not serious?""
Sasha smiled. ""I've always been serious.""
He reached up for the key with all his strength and was about to snatch it from the wall when an arm snaked around his shoulder and clamped down tightly.
""What are you doing?"" she asked as he stumbled backward, nearly falling.
""I was trying to reach the key.""
""I saw what you were doing,"" she replied, grabbing his hair and jerking his head back before he could turn to face her.",1183,0.0686334821468793,-0.4798000110690262,-0.8300569940578296,1.559847280295665,-0.4410850218883136
110,R_3Gs2L1Vj67R9C9n,ACE_HR_8,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her long hair fell about her shoulders, its dark color making it seem as though she were wearing a cloak of shadow. He had to look twice to be sure that wasn't what it was. It took a moment for her face to register in his mind. When it did, his heart leapt. The woman sitting before him was no one he'd ever seen before, not even in pictures or paintings.
She looked up and their eyes met. His pulse raced; he felt like his blood was on fire. For an instant they stared at each other. Then, as if she'd been struck by lightning, she rose from her seat, turned, and walked away. He couldn't believe how much he wanted to go after her—to follow her outside and make sure she got home safely. But there hadn't been time. If he'd tried to stop her, he would have embarrassed himself, so he watched until she disappeared around the corner.
He didn't see her again for two days. That evening he went out with friends to a nearby tavern. On impulse, he ordered a drink, then sat down beside a table where three women were sitting together. He asked them about the mysterious stranger who'd just left, but none of them knew anything about her. They were all curious about why she'd come in and why she'd left without ordering a drink. One of them suggested that maybe she was waiting for someone.
When he came back to work the next day, he told everyone who'd asked about the strange lady who'd sat down beside him and left abruptly the night before. Everyone laughed. Some said they thought she might be a prostitute looking for clients. Others guessed that maybe she'd gotten cold feet when she realized she'd seen the wrong man and fled. None of them had any idea who she could possibly be.
That night, while working behind the bar, he noticed another woman standing near the door. He recognized her immediately. This time he made sure he saw her before she left. Again, he was certain he knew her, although this time he had trouble remembering her name. But when she smiled, he knew it was the same woman. There was something different about her now, some kind of sadness that made her seem older than she actually was.
He didn't see her again for several days. Then, one afternoon, she came in alone. She sat at the end of the counter closest to the door, and he poured her a glass of wine. As he set the glass in front of her, he looked straight into her eyes and found them as compelling as before. Something inside him responded to the way they looked at him. She looked away quickly, blushing slightly, as if she was shy.
Her smile seemed tentative, as if she weren't quite sure how to react to him. But when he reached over and touched her hand, she relaxed a bit. And when he gave her the sweetest kiss imaginable on her cheek, she leaned forward and kissed him lightly on the lips. She tasted like strawberries, and the feeling of her soft body against his sent waves of heat through him. Before he could think clearly, he put his arms around her waist and pulled her close.
It happened fast and it was over almost too soon. When he let her go, she stood up slowly. He could tell she was disappointed, and he was afraid she might leave right then. So he hurriedly offered to bring her a refill. By the time he returned with the new glass, she was gone.
But the next morning, while doing inventory in the storage room, he discovered a bottle of wine in a box marked ""private stock."" It contained only six bottles, which meant whoever had brought it must've known exactly how many there were. Only one person fit that description.
So he went upstairs, opened the storeroom door, and called out, ""Hello? Are you still here?"" No answer. He closed the door and walked to the shelf where the wine was stored. Opening the top drawer, he removed the key to the lock and unlocked the case. Taking a bottle off the shelf, he replaced it with the one he'd taken. Then he locked the drawer again and hid the key in his pocket.
Later, when he told the others at the tavern about what he'd done, they congratulated him. All except for a friend named Marcus. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""If I'd been the guy in that story, I probably wouldn't want anyone knowing about it. After all, what if she's married or engaged or something?""
""What difference does it make?"" demanded another friend, a large fellow named Dario. ""You're single yourself. You should be able to enjoy the company of whomever you choose.""
They argued for a while, but when they finished, nobody seemed very enthusiastic about trying to find out more about her.
The next day, he waited until late afternoon to see her. She came into the tavern and sat at the end of the bar again. This time, she stayed longer. She talked to everyone who came into the place, laughing easily and seeming to really enjoy herself.
After closing, he followed her home. It was the longest walk he'd ever taken, but he enjoyed every step of it. Finally, she stopped at an old stone house at the edge of town. It was dark by the time he arrived. The light from a single lantern illuminated her face as she looked out the window at him. She waved and beckoned him to come in.
Once he stepped inside, she led him to the kitchen and began lighting candles. ""Please sit down,"" she said, motioning toward the table. ""I'll get us some food and drinks.""
She disappeared into the main part of the house, and he heard her moving around for a few minutes. Then she reappeared carrying two glasses filled with red liquid. Sitting down across from him, she handed him one. ""Here, try this. It's delicious.""
He sipped the wine and felt his heart pound. It tasted like blood.
""Where did you get this?"" he asked.
""My father makes it,"" she replied.
""How long has he been making it?""
""As long as I can remember. It's his secret recipe. No one else knows how to make it. Not even my mother.""
""Is he going to make more of it?""
She shook her head. ""He doesn't do much of anything anymore. He used to brew his own ale, and he was good at it. People would buy his beer by the barrelful. But since he retired, he spends most of his time sitting around the house drinking. Sometimes he gets so drunk he doesn't even go outside. It worries me, because he hasn't been well for years. I'm not sure how much longer he will live. But as long as he does, he won't make any more of his special wine. That is why I asked you to taste it.""
He drank some more and felt the blood coursing through his veins.",1233,-0.9970609286475625,0.6095282487479982,0.4935338944610819,-0.5579326606250953,0.023323073189017805
111,R_2rARpxxR7vSPKTT,OUR_HOR_8,Horror,Ouroboros,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The face had long red hair and sharp features that made it look like a corpse. I tried to scream, but my mouth was dry. Then I noticed my hand was in a cast. The woman's hand looked like mine until she started screaming, then they were reversed. ""Help! Someone help me!"" I cried. But no one came because I had fallen asleep.
The next morning, I decided to see if there was any coffee in the kitchen. There wasn't much and it was burnt. It smelled like someone had smoked weed before making it. When I went outside, I found two police officers waiting for me. One of them had dark curly hair while the other's hair was short with a black mustache. They had blue eyes and white shirts on.
""Can we talk with you?"" the blonde cop said.
I nodded and followed him to his car. He turned on some classical music and asked me all about what happened last night.
""Weird right? My name is Jane, what's your names?"" I asked.
""My name is Brian and this is Robert,"" he answered.
""I'm so sorry to wake you up at this time in the morning, but we really need you to tell us about what happened. We think it might be important, and we would hate to see anything happen to you,"" Robert said.
""Nothing happened. I had a bad dream. What do you mean it might be important?"" I said.
""Jane, we have reason to believe that the killer is in the area,"" Robert said.
""What?! Really, why? You should probably tell someone else than the person who is the victim,"" I said.
""The killer usually shows up before midnight. He kills whoever is in the house at the time. And then he takes their organs out. This has been happening since the 1950's.""
""Well, my parents moved here when they were teenagers. They got married and never left,"" I said.
""Well, that's good. There is only a small chance of anyone being the next victim. Let's just hope that doesn't happen,"" Robert said.
The police officers drove off, and I decided to make some coffee. Then I heard another knock on the mirror.
""Who is it?"" I called out.
""I'm coming in!"" a woman's voice answered.
""Just a second,"" I said as I closed the door behind me. ""What are you doing here?""
""I thought I'd come over for a cup of tea. I figured you had enough to do without worrying about me,"" she answered.
""What made you think that?""
""You didn't seem like a murderer yourself,"" she said as she took a seat.
""Yeah, well, I don't want to go to jail. I don't know what to say or do if the cops come back,"" I said.
""So, you've been a real help today,"" she said. ""How about we play a little game to pass the time. I'll start with a question. Who is the most famous person in the world?""
""What?"" I asked.
""You can't say anyone. The person you say, I will make sure no one knows the answer,"" she said.
""All right, I'll give it a shot. You want to hear something really dumb? What about the Pope? He is pretty famous,"" I said.
""Wrong,"" she said. ""What about Marilyn Monroe?""
I was stumped. ""No, that's not it either.""
""We're going to keep playing until you say the right answer. One more question,"" she said. ""Who is the smartest man who ever lived?""
""How could anyone be the smartest man who has ever lived? I would have to meet him,"" I said.
""Sorry to say, you never will,"" she said.
""I'm done. I just can't get past one. If you could do that to me, you can take over the world!"" I said.
""Of course, but I won't. Not yet. But when you least expect it, I will show up and then you will be in the middle of my world,"" she said as she walked off into the house.
""This isn't like me at all. I mean, I had coffee and was feeling fine,"" I thought to myself.
I went back into the house, took a shower, and got dressed. After I was finished getting ready, I decided to go out for some fresh air. I opened the door to see if I could find something good to eat. On my way home, I was about to turn off the road, but I heard someone call me from behind me.
""Jane, are you there?"" a man said.
I turned around to see him sitting on top of a garbage can. His skin was black and his eyes were green.
""My name is Robert. You look lost, can I help you?"" he said.
""Well, I am. I have no idea where I'm going. The only thing I know is that I want to go back to my house. But how am I supposed to get there if I don't even know where it is,"" I asked.
""Well, I will walk with you until I can figure out what's going on. It sounds like the killer is close, so we should hurry. Are you a fan of classical music?"" he asked.
""No, I hate it, especially that one."" I said, pointing to the classical music playing outside.
""We are about to cross over to the other side. We might be able to stop him from doing any more harm,"" he said.
I followed him across the road and he led me to an old house that was falling apart. He knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Then he unlocked the door and we stepped inside. When we got in, it was dark and cold. There was dust everywhere and the air smelled of mold.
""Do you think someone is here?"" I asked.
""Let's check, and we will find out,"" he said.
When we walked through the first room, I noticed it was very clean. We went upstairs and it looked untouched. Then we came to a bedroom that had a single bed, a nightstand, a dresser, and a closet. When I opened the door to the closet, there were no clothes inside, but a girl's face was looking back at us. She wore the same clothing as the woman I had seen before.
""Are you the killer?"" she asked.
""That's not your job. Why are you in this house?"" Robert asked.",1122,-1.6099627746714156,-1.6441584294297085,0.028226876356883025,-1.1398755939830179,-1.7650053494520843
112,R_2cwoypGi1xpLjPf,LOW_HOR_1,Horror,Low Rider,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The same one as last time. It was still wearing an old-fashioned nurse's uniform, with a white cap on its head. I didn't recognize this face though.
It looked like someone who would have been working in a mental hospital. It wasn't the type that you'd see in modern horror films or anything like that. They were kind of like nurses, but they had different uniforms for each facility. This one looked very clean cut and well cared for.
""Hello, Mr. Cooper."" The woman said.
The name sounded familiar somehow, but I couldn't place where I knew it from. ""What are you doing here?"" I asked.
She smiled and put her finger to her lips. She then moved closer to me and whispered, ""We're not supposed to talk in front of others.""
""I guess not..."" I replied.
She took my hand and led me down the hallway to the room next to mine. There was another man already inside the room. He stood up when he saw us coming, and she pulled me by the hand into the room with him.
""My name is Doctor Lyle. You can call me Dr. Lyle,"" The doctor said.
He was an older man, about my father's age or even a little more. His hair was thinning at the top, but it was mostly brown with just a few strands of grey in it. His eyes were sharp and calculating, and his skin was slightly pale. He was average height and built a bit on the lean side. But there was something about him that made me think he wasn't human.
""Mr. Cooper,"" Doctor Lyle continued. ""This gentleman is a patient. Do you know what happens to patients after they're sent away? Most don't make it back home.""
""Yes, sir. I'm afraid I do. My wife will be devastated,"" I said, trying to keep my voice low.
""Don't worry about your wife. We'll take care of her for you, and she won't know a thing."" The doctor replied.
As I listened to them talk, I felt as if my world had ended. I knew something terrible was going to happen before any of it began. But I had no idea how much worse things could get.
""I want you to meet someone else."" Dr. Lyle said. He then left the room and came back a few minutes later with two other men.
One was a short skinny guy who looked around 30 years old. The second man was taller, but he also looked like he was close to 50 years old. He was balding, with grey hair on top of his head and a bushy beard down to his chest. He had bags under his eyes and deep lines etched across his face. Both men were dressed like doctors too.
""You must be Mr. Cooper,"" the man with the grey hair said. He held out his hand and I shook it.
""Call me Frank,"" I told him.
""Frank, please come with me,"" Dr. Lyle said. ""We need to get you changed out of those clothes so we can get started.""
I followed Frank out of the room and into another one nearby. It was bigger than the other ones, and it appeared that it used to be part of a larger building at some point in history. But now it only consisted of two rooms and a bathroom.
I went inside with Frank and sat on the examination table. A nurse came in and began taking off my shirt and jeans, then she began cleaning the cuts and scrapes on my body. Afterward, she pulled me onto the exam table and started to check me over again. She asked me some questions that I couldn't answer. She asked how I injured myself, why I was there, and a lot of other things that I simply didn't understand.
The door to the room suddenly opened and a third man came in. This man had long black hair and an eye patch covering his right eye. His left eye was hidden behind a pair of sunglasses, and he wore a lab coat like the rest of the doctors and nurses in the facility did.
""Good morning, Frank,"" the man said as he walked towards the table. ""How's our patient today?""
""He seems to be doing quite well, Doctor,"" Frank replied.
Doctor Salkan nodded to the nurse. ""Well, let's get started then.""
The woman removed the sheet and started pulling the electrodes off my arms and legs, and then she placed a tube of lubricant over them. She then inserted a large electrode into my left arm while Doctor Salkan attached a lead to an IV drip stand next to the table.
""Is that necessary?"" I asked. ""I mean, I'm not sure why they all do that.""
Dr. Salkan smiled at me. ""You won't feel a thing from these. I promise.""
I nodded and closed my eyes. The sound of a vacuum cleaner filled the room, and the feeling of something cold running down my skin soon followed. The next thing I knew, I woke up.
There was a light shining in my face, and the sounds of machines beeping and people talking drifted through the walls. I felt as if I had just woken up from a bad dream, but my entire body ached as if something horrible had happened to me.
""Mr. Cooper! Wake up!"" A voice called out to me.
I slowly opened my eyes and saw Frank staring down at me. My vision was blurry, but I could tell that everything wasn't normal.
""Where am I?"" I asked Frank as he helped me sit up on the table.
He smiled at me as he answered, ""You're safe, Mr. Cooper.""
""Safe? Where are we?"" I asked. ""How long was I asleep?""
Frank glanced down at the clock hanging above my head. ""You were just sleeping for about 20 minutes.""
I tried to rub the sleep from my eyes, but I couldn't see very well. ""What is this place?"" I asked.
""We're not at the facility anymore,"" Frank explained.
""Then what are we at?"" I asked.
""We're somewhere new, and it's better than the hospital,"" Frank said as he helped me back onto the table and covered me back up again. ""I'll leave you for a minute to change back into your own clothes.""
I nodded to Frank as I laid back down. The next thing I knew, the door to the room opened and Frank returned with several other people. All of them were wearing scrubs and had clipboards in their hands, and each one had a set of small metal tools with them as well.
""Are you ready?"" Doctor Salkan asked as he stepped into the room.
I nodded, but I still couldn't see very well yet.
""Excellent."" He turned to the group of doctors and nurses. ""Let's get started.""
The people all walked to different corners of the room and began setting up things that I didn't understand.",1215,-1.4132604536182611,-0.8745258269188445,-0.06113236904390709,-1.2942768725289877,-0.24117651001830687
113,R_vfs8gF0CGSibH57,OUR_HOR_2,Horror,Ouroboros,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't mine; it was one that I had never seen before. I knew that it didn't belong there because I couldn't recognize it. That was why it had frightened me. It scared me to no end when I realized that I hadn't put it there. There was nothing inside my head that could have done this. There wasn't any curse or spell cast upon me that would have made me do that to myself in the first place. So then who was it? Who had done it?
When I finally found my voice, I called out ""Who's there?"" but still no one answered me. In fact, no one could answer me. This was something new entirely and I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. If the mirror were to speak, then it would only say nonsense. I know this because when I called out for help, not even an echo returned. Even if someone had heard me calling out, they wouldn't be able to find me because I wasn't anywhere to be seen. Not even a single piece of hair was there as proof that I ever existed. My whole body was covered in nothingness. This made me think that maybe whoever this was, they knew more than they were letting on about their identity. They wanted to keep themselves hidden for whatever reason, which was making everything even more confusing and bizarre.
I kept staring at the mirror waiting for someone to come out of it so that we could start talking, but there was no one else to be seen. It was just me standing there staring at the mirror wondering where I would go next. What would I do now? Would I stay here forever? Was there a way that I could get back home to where everyone was and live a normal life again? It felt like everything was closing in around me, leaving me no choice but to give up on the thought of going home. Then suddenly, my reflection started moving and turned its face toward me. It stared into the glass with empty eyes.
""Don't you recognize me?"" asked my reflection in a cold voice. ""Aren't we friends? Aren't we together?""
It sounded almost like it was pleading, but I wasn't quite sure what that meant or why it would sound that way. I wasn't quite sure how I could trust anything it said either because I didn't know who it really was. It had already gone too far for me to be able to believe anything it said anymore. Maybe it was one of those people that used their voices to disguise themselves. I don't know what they're called. I had heard of them before, but I couldn't tell if this person was one of them. I could only think about the words that it spoke.
""What happened?"" asked the voice. ""Why are we separated? How come I can't see you?""
""What's wrong?"" I asked in response. ""Are you hurt?""
My reflection started moving around in front of the mirror as it began speaking more loudly. ""Is this some kind of joke? Why is my body all alone in here? Have I gone insane? No, I don't think so! This has to be a nightmare!""
I kept staring at my reflection and waited for an answer, but there was nothing that came back to me. I had never been in such a situation before. I wasn't quite sure what to do. I didn't want to talk to myself because I knew that it wouldn't help. That was what had gotten me into this mess in the first place. There was no point in talking to myself. I looked back up at the mirror again, still hoping for a miracle. But all it had in response were tears. It continued to cry and weep without giving me any answers as to why I was being left out of what was going on. I felt like I should be the one crying instead because I had lost everyone I knew and loved, but I didn't. Instead, I just stood there in silence staring at the glass. I didn't know what else to say or do, which left me feeling even more confused. Then, when I turned around to look at the other side of the mirror, it wasn't there anymore. The only thing that was there was a cloud of smoke that was floating there. When I moved closer to the mirror to try and see inside of it, my reflection didn't seem to notice. I don't know what to make of it yet. Maybe I'll figure something out later, but until then I have to go back to where I'm staying. I think it's time that I tried to find out what this mirror is supposed to be for. It was too strange for me to ignore. If anything else strange happens, I'm sure that I'll figure it out then. For now, I guess I'll start from the beginning.
I was walking down the street heading toward my house when I suddenly saw an old lady fall and lose her balance. She fell right onto the ground in front of me. I helped her up by putting my arms under her armpits. When I did, I noticed that her skin was dark like pitch. In fact, she had a face that was almost as black as charcoal. It looked almost like she had been carved out of coal. As soon as she came back to her senses, she started asking me some weird questions that I didn't understand. Her voice sounded as though it belonged to a person that was dead. At least that's how I felt about it anyway. She asked me if I could see my reflection and if we were friends. I told her that I couldn't answer any of those questions because I didn't know the answers myself. The only thing I knew for certain was that I wasn't dreaming or anything. She told me not to worry because I wasn't crazy and neither was she. I kept looking at the old lady's reflection to see what would happen and all of a sudden it vanished from my sight. That left me more confused than I already was. I figured that maybe she was just one of those people that used their voices to disguise themselves so that they could hide themselves better. Then, she began talking about something else.
""Do you want to play?"" she asked me.
I was confused. I couldn't understand a word that she said and I was still worried about what had happened to the old woman on the street. ""I can't understand you,"" I answered back to her in a panic. ""Can you speak properly please?""
My reflection didn't seem to care one bit and continued to talk to me without getting upset about it. ""Play?"" she repeated. ""What do you mean by 'play'?""
She took a step forward toward me and pointed right into my face. I tried to keep her away from me by moving backward, but she kept coming closer. When she spoke again, I heard a voice coming out of her that was much deeper than before. It was like she was trying to imitate something and ended up sounding more like an animal instead. I didn't know what it was that I was hearing, but I knew that I didn't want anything to do with her. All I wanted was to get as far away from her as I possibly could. My reflection suddenly grabbed me by the throat and began shaking me around. I looked into its eyes and saw that they were completely black.",1340,-1.0062621501216042,0.0529944638775578,1.041660478197362,0.10914339991869264,-0.3498871360110319
114,R_DvjP0DLMXJZCjux,BAS_HR_6,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been so busy that day with customers who wanted to talk about their problems and ask for advice that she hadn't caught his eye until it was too late. When he finally realized what she was doing, he couldn't help but stare. She wore an old-fashioned dress of black wool, cut low on her neckline and showing off a lot more cleavage than he liked. Her hair was long and loose, falling down over her shoulders as if it were made from spun gold. It was such a pretty shade of blonde, and it seemed to glow against the dark color of her dress. The way she held herself reminded him of a cat—her head up high, chin out, eyes narrowed in disdain. But there was something else about her that drew his attention. There was no mistaking it; she was beautiful. Even though he knew better, he could not take his eyes off her.
He watched her as she drank her ale and ate some bread and cheese. He kept stealing glances at her even when he wasn't looking directly at her. His gaze would wander back to her every few minutes, but she never noticed him. She didn't seem to notice anyone except the people she spoke to or the other men who came by to flirt with her.
After she finished eating, she got up and went outside to smoke a pipe. That's when he decided to try to speak to her. He approached her and asked if she needed any assistance. She turned around, startled, then smiled at him. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""You startled me.""
""It's all right,"" he replied. ""What can I do for you?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Are you new here? You don't look familiar.""
""No, I've lived here most of my life. What can I do for you?""
Her smile widened. ""Well, I just need someone to carry this stuff to my room for me."" She handed him a large bag filled with clothes and shoes.
He took the bag and followed her upstairs. As they walked along, he tried to think of something clever to say to get her attention again. Finally, he blurted out, ""Do you know what happened to the king's daughter?""
She stopped walking and stared at him. ""Excuse me?""
""The princess. Do you know why she ran away?""
""Why should I care?"" she asked. ""I haven't seen her since she left home.""
""That's because she is dead,"" he said.
""Dead? How did she die?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Everyone says she died in childbirth, but I heard that she was murdered. Someone killed her baby and then stabbed her.""
""Oh, dear,"" she said. ""Did she have a husband?""
""Yes, but I don't think he knows anything about it yet. They're still searching for her body. If they find it, then he'll be notified.""
""Where will they search?""
""They won't tell us. All we know is that they are going to search everywhere.""
""So, how do you know she's dead?"" she asked.
""Because she was supposed to marry Prince Arvin, but now he has no wife. So, everyone thinks that the prince must have done it. And if he did, then he would want to hide the evidence so no one would ever suspect him.""
""But who could kill the princess without being caught?"" she asked.
He shrugged. ""Maybe someone who knew her very well. Maybe someone she trusted.""
""And why would she trust them?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Because they loved her, maybe.""
""How do you know she was pregnant?""
""Because her maid told me. She said she was carrying twins.""
""Twins?"" she repeated. ""Really? Why would she have two babies?""
""I don't know. Maybe she already had one child and wanted another.""
She shook her head. ""I don't understand women. I only know about men. Men always want to make more children, especially after they get married. Women usually don't want to.""
""Well, I guess that makes sense,"" he said.
""Does it really? I mean, I've never thought about it before.""
He nodded. ""I suppose it does.""
When they reached her door, he set the bag down and helped her take off her coat. Then she opened her trunk and pulled out several dresses.
""Can you put these in my room for me?"" she asked.
He picked up the bag and carried it inside while she changed. When she was ready to go downstairs, she thanked him and gave him a small coin.
""Thank you for your help,"" she said.
As he left, he wondered whether she would ever see him again. He hoped she would, but he wasn't sure. He wished he had spoken to her earlier, but he couldn't change what had happened. He might have missed his chance forever.
He went back to work, trying to forget about her. After all, he was engaged to be married, and he didn't need any distractions. He had a good job and a nice fiancée. He didn't need anything else.
Two days later, he was surprised to see her sitting at the same table where he worked. He almost dropped his tray of food. He quickly walked over to her and apologized for dropping it.
""Don't worry about it,"" she said. ""It's all right.""
""I'm sorry. I hope I didn't ruin your meal.""
""Not at all. It was just a little spill. No big deal.""
He smiled. ""Good. Now, let me clean it up.""
He grabbed a rag and cleaned it up as best he could. ""Here you go,"" he said. ""I hope you don't mind that I spilled it.""
""Of course not. Thank you.""
He felt awkward standing there, so he walked away. He couldn't believe she was still there. He couldn't stop thinking about her. He wanted to talk to her again, but he was afraid of making a fool of himself.
The next day, she came to eat lunch with her friend. She sat in the same seat as the previous day. This time, he didn't drop anything, and he was able to serve her without incident. He was relieved that she was still there.
Later that afternoon, she came in again. He served her and then waited until she was finished eating. He was nervous, but he knew he couldn't stay quiet anymore.",1093,0.37536070429694535,-0.5036184901178011,-0.5894666116240291,-0.1336698435096881,-0.8227719891801012
115,R_3gYJ7CUBqMwkZ84,LOW_HR_10,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He didn't look up from what he was doing. The second he looked up she was gone. It had been so long since that day he hadn't thought of it. But there she was in his dreams. Her eyes, her mouth…her hair.
She wasn't real; she was just a dream. His mother said dreams were the mind trying to make sense of something that couldn't be understood with words or reason. And when the dream ended, you went back to living your life as if nothing had happened. But for some reason, he felt drawn to this woman. Drawn by a desire stronger than any other he'd ever known. She was like no other. He couldn't get enough of looking at her and touching her. In his dreams she never rejected him, but always wanted him more. Every night his dream became a little bit clearer. The more he watched her, the better she appeared to him.
And then she walked through the door of his home. His brother's home, not his own, but a home nonetheless. She stood there, staring straight at him. A smile on her face. And then she walked out again before he could move an inch toward her.
""Who was that?"" his brother asked. ""Why are you staring at the wall?""
He turned around quickly and pretended he hadn't seen her. That was the only way to save her from the inevitable.
""What are you talking about? Who would want to marry my sister?""
That was exactly the thing he needed to know. What was it that made her special to someone else, even though she was clearly meant to be with him? Why couldn't she love him too? He stared down at the floor as he walked away.
His brother took one look at him and followed. ""You have a problem,"" he told him. ""I've never seen you like this.""
""It's nothing I can't handle,"" he replied.
""Are you going to let her walk away again like that?""
The truth was, yes he was. There were other ways to win a lady over than just asking. His father used to tell him that. He was supposed to learn to court a young woman by being charming and witty. He wasn't sure if he had those things in him. He knew he wasn't handsome, and that certainly wouldn't help his cause. But if she loved him, she should want him regardless of his appearance.
""I'm working on it.""
His brother shook his head in disbelief. ""How can you not see that you two belong together? I know you're attracted to each other, but she is married. You can't go after her anymore.""
""My mother says I need to be patient.""
He was beginning to think they were both insane. How could anyone wait for something so beautiful to happen? They weren't in love yet. He didn't know if she even liked him. And now here she was, standing in front of him, just like in his dreams. It seemed impossible that it could actually be happening, but he was determined to give her every opportunity to fall for him.
""Do you need a new place to live? Maybe you should try another inn. Something with less customers might be better.""
That made him laugh out loud. ""If my wife can't stand the thought of me talking to a pretty woman, maybe we shouldn't get married at all.""
""Don't talk like that!"" his brother cried. ""We will get married! I promise you, it'll all work out.""
He wasn't so sure of that, but he'd take his brother's word for it. At least until he had proof to the contrary. And right now he had no idea how he could prove anything. She was married! How could that be possible? He wasn't allowed to talk to her, to touch her, to kiss her, to even speak in front of her, unless her husband gave him permission.
He knew the answer to that question. He'd seen her eyes. He remembered their color perfectly. The green of a forest at sunset.
The man who was supposedly responsible for that color was standing in front of him. His brother's new friend. This stranger who claimed to be an artist. But what kind of painter paints such beautiful women? And who would believe a painter was responsible for creating such perfection?
""Hello,"" the man said as he came to stand beside him. ""I am sorry if I scared you.""
""Oh no, please don't apologize."" He smiled at the man, hoping to hide his embarrassment. ""You have a very strange manner of speaking.""
""Thank you,"" the man replied, still smiling. ""But it is not so strange. You see, I am not from the area where you are from.""
""I'm from a faraway land called England,"" the man answered. ""My name is Nicholas. And your name is…""
""…Roland, sir.""
Nicholas laughed loudly. ""That's funny. So many names, Roland. So many different places. I suppose your parents must be very proud of you.""
""They are."" He was glad that his brother had found such a good friend.
""I am also very proud of you,"" Nicholas said with a smile. ""Very proud.""
""Thank you,"" he replied, feeling suddenly shy. ""I am pleased to meet you. My brother has told me quite a lot about you.""
""Yes, he does,"" Nicholas agreed. ""He likes to share all of our conversations with everyone he knows. It's a shame he doesn't listen to what people say about him sometimes.""
Roland didn't understand why his brother spoke so highly of this stranger. If the man had been telling people terrible stories about him, surely Roland would have heard about it.
""Is that why you are painting me?"" he asked quietly. ""To put bad things about me on canvas and show them to the world? That seems foolish to me.""
""Not at all,"" Nicholas assured him. ""I am only painting what I see. And I do not consider the people in the pictures to be foolish. I find them to be very interesting.""
""So you aren't trying to tell everyone about my faults?"" he asked anxiously.
""No, not at all,"" the man replied quickly. ""I think the things you did yesterday were very courageous.""
""Did you know about my father?""
Nicholas nodded solemnly. ""Yes. I know about his crimes. And while I believe he deserved to be punished for what he did, I am also very impressed by the way you have lived your life since.",1121,0.3125154456407604,0.05502065826410093,1.1938667792044084,-0.22479758067866684,-0.061282408780766594
116,R_2rIW2LT7seSvyZ3,OUR_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
As usual, I headed towards the park next to our apartment complex where there was plenty of space to work out. There were several different workout equipment machines that I could choose from; but after using the same machines every day, I always gravitated back to the elliptical machine. My mind would race during the workout as my body burned away calories, so it helped keep me calm.
That was the problem these days. Calm.
I had been living on Mars for almost four years now, and I didn't know how long I'd be able to do so before I broke down completely. Sure, it sounded great being on Mars when you heard about it. There were no diseases, no mosquitoes, no nasty bugs or parasites—nothing like Earth. It also meant there were no big predators like sharks, tigers, or bears, either. But that was the only thing that sounded great about it. The other things weren't so great.
No air to breathe. No food. No water. No electricity.
""What do they think I am? An astronaut? I'm not in the space program. I don't want to die! And yet here I am, trying to survive on an alien planet with nothing more than a bag of water, a couple of cans of soup, and a pair of running shoes.""
After my workout, I headed to the dining hall to grab some lunch before heading over to the president's office. As I sat down at a table, I looked around the room. All of the people that I was sitting near were older and had families. They were all doing great and had stable lives.
I never thought of myself as a ""loser"", but lately I felt like one. I had moved to Mars to experience something new and exciting, but here I was, just another old man who had no life outside of work.
It wasn't that I disliked my job or anything, though. Actually, I loved working for the government and everything about it. I was constantly learning something new every day, and I always kept up-to-date with the latest scientific developments. Every week I'd go to a research facility in the city to see what the scientists were working on, and then report back to the president with my findings. I could have continued doing that job, even on Mars, but it wasn't the same as when I was out there, getting my hands dirty and studying new planets.
My only regret was that I hadn't learned to control my powers sooner.
When I first arrived on Mars, I would sometimes feel odd or different about myself, and I attributed this to my environment. But then one night in my hotel room, I was lying on the bed watching some mindless TV show when something strange happened. As I was drifting off to sleep, my eyes flew open, and I realized that I was seeing the room in a way that most people wouldn't normally be able to do. I tried to tell myself that it was just a dream, but then the door opened and the president walked in.
""Hey, Mathew,"" he said, sitting down across from me. ""I wanted to talk to you about something important."" He pulled an envelope out of his coat pocket and handed it over. When I took it, he continued talking. ""The president is going to need more of your time and attention. We want to make sure that all the projects are moving forward properly. And that we're not missing any new opportunities for funding, either. You'll have to move into a small apartment over on the north side of the city.""
I looked up at him confused. ""You want me to live in an apartment? Why can't I just commute in?""
""That's what I'm here for, Mathew."" He laughed. ""We didn't want to scare you by saying that you'd be moving back to Earth.""
""Oh,"" I said. ""Yeah, that makes sense.""
After I moved out to my new apartment, I spent a lot of time trying to think of a way that I could control my power so that I would never have to leave Mars again. I didn't have to worry about dying, which was a plus. But I felt like I was stuck on this planet until I figured out how to make the powers work. If only I had been able to figure out a way to control them sooner.
Every night I'd go to sleep, hoping that tomorrow I might wake up and have learned how to control my abilities. But I always woke up feeling like I was the same old man who had been on the red planet for years. It was hard to explain, but I just didn't feel different in the mornings. Even after getting a good night's sleep.
Now I had a message from the president telling me to get back to work—not that it mattered. There was no point in going to Earth anymore. I wasn't special, and I definitely didn't look like one. I was just another human being that nobody thought anything of. I was invisible.
I guess it didn't matter that I couldn't use my powers. Because as long as they never left Mars, I was fine with that. I just didn't want to live there forever.
The president's office was located on the top floor of one of the tallest buildings in the city. As I walked through the revolving door, I could see people inside, working at computers or talking over the phone. Everything looked pretty normal. And yet as I made my way towards the elevator bank, I felt something strange. Something was off about the air I was breathing in.
I turned around and looked down the hallway behind me, and saw several other people walking towards the elevators too. They all seemed to be smiling and laughing, but their smiles were forced. I was surprised to hear what one of the men was saying to another: ""Well, I guess we can forget about that one, huh? That girl was way out of my league."" The two men chuckled together before continuing their conversation.
As soon as they got on the elevator, the doors closed, and I knew I had to get off this floor and quickly. I headed back outside to my car and drove away from the city, not wanting to go back inside.
Once I made it home, I grabbed some takeout food and sat down to eat. As I ate my lunch, I tried to think of something else to distract me, but the images from the city continued to flood my mind. I started to feel anxious again.
I could sense a lot of energy in the air. I could also tell that it was moving from the ground into the atmosphere and then back down again. A lot of people were using their powers all around me—and I wasn't able to control any of them. I felt helpless as I stared at the ceiling in my apartment. I wondered if there was anyone else who was going through the same thing. If so, I figured they would have left Mars by now.
I woke up the next day feeling like shit. Every part of me ached, and I could hardly move. My arms and legs were so weak that I was worried that I might fall over in my sleep.",1307,0.9597396522505159,0.4882640172812212,0.002627152033338519,0.7319609245074602,0.2441287194000686

The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It's beautiful here,"" she said after a moment. ""I can't imagine what kind of monsters lurk around these parts."" She shuddered slightly. ""Or even worse, the humans who might take us hostage or do something worse than that.""
""If anyone took you hostage, they'd regret it,"" he said.
She chuckled at that. ""What? You would kill them?""
""You've seen me in action. I'm an orc, after all."" He gave her a grin. ""Don't worry, my little human friend, I'll protect you.""
He let his gaze wander over the peaceful scene. A cool breeze blew past him, stirring the wisps of hair that had escaped from his braid.
""If the town is deserted, does that mean we have to build our own shelter?"" she asked.
He shook his head. ""That was my hope, though if there are other orcs around, I doubt any of us would mind sharing.""
""There isn't anyone else here?""
""Not yet. Not in any large numbers anyway. The ores and the humans must still be fighting somewhere else.""
She nodded and then looked back up at the sky.
""It looks like it will rain soon,"" he told her.
""Oh no. It would be such a shame to have this perfect weather ruined by a storm.""
He laughed at that. ""And what does 'perfect' mean to you?""
Her eyes widened. ""I don't know. That's a good question. Perfect for me would probably be—""
""Peace? Calm?"" He cocked his head. ""Disease-free?""
""Yes, yes, those things,"" she said and sighed. ""But I suppose perfect could also mean something like—I don't know—the absence of pain."" She rubbed the side of her face where the wound still ached. ""You can have peace or you can have perfect, but never both at once. There will always be pain.""
He shook his head. ""That's a terrible outlook on life, don't you think? What is the point of living if all you do is hurt?""
""You're not supposed to ask such questions to orcs,"" she said and smiled weakly. ""But I guess that answers your question anyway. Humans are always looking for the perfect answer. You could get hit by lightning, catch an infection from some unknown virus and die."" She glanced over at him. ""Or worse. Maybe even a human could be the reason you got hurt. It could be some asshole in a city who decides to punch you out.""
""What about orcs?"" he asked.
She shook her head. ""We can't live forever, though I hear our kind doesn't have to fear diseases so much as we did in the past. But, yeah, that's all just a part of the cycle of life. Nothing to be afraid of, nothing to be desired.""
He nodded and gave a small smile.
""Is this what being in love is like?"" she asked.
His smile faded. ""I don't know."" He looked around the area again. ""If there's no one else here, I'm guessing we'll be the only ones for a while. Unless some ores or humans are already holed up somewhere nearby.""
""So where are they?""
He shrugged. ""Who knows? We can take shelter in the village, if you want, but there might not be anything useful inside it. I could gather some firewood to start a small campfire, though.""
""That would be wonderful.""
They made their way towards the buildings and the trees.
""Are you sure about this?"" she asked. ""You know we're going to get into trouble if anyone finds us.""
""The more trouble we cause, the better, right?"" He flashed her a grin. ""This is a good chance for us to be a bit more dangerous.""
""True,"" she said with a nod. ""Maybe we should kill them.""
He laughed again. ""Don't worry about that. Let's just gather some wood. This looks like the right place for it.""
""That's a relief to hear. I didn't know you had so much restraint.""
""It comes from growing up on a farm. My father was a very hard man. We had to respect him, or else he would make our lives difficult. The same goes for my brothers and sisters. If they thought we were too loud or rambunctious, my mother would give us a beating.""
She looked over at him again. ""I don't think I ever heard your parents' names.""
""They died in a fire when I was only five years old.""
""Oh, I'm sorry."" She frowned slightly. ""How did it happen?""
""I think someone broke in and set the whole house on fire. There wasn't any warning—we were all asleep inside, and then suddenly we were waking up with smoke all around us. My father tried to save my mother, but he couldn't because the flames were too hot. He died saving her.""
""That must have been horrible.""
""Yes, it was."" He nodded and put his hand on top of hers as they walked.
""Why don't you tell me about them instead?"" she suggested. ""Who were they and what kind of people were they?""
""My father was named Tristan and my mother's name was Serena.""
""Were you close to them?""
He chuckled. ""Not really. They were always angry at me. My father never wanted anything to do with me except to yell at me, and my mother was the same way. I don't know if they were jealous because I had so many siblings who came after me, but I'm sure they were. I only wish I could have known them better. My memories are hazy, but I can still hear their voices in my mind.""
She squeezed his hand, which made him smile. ""You didn't have an easy life.""
""No,"" he replied. ""I didn't.""
The rain started a short time later, and it grew louder and heavier with each passing minute. It seemed like the whole sky was crying in response to the emotional state of the people around them. He let go of her hand and looked out into the woods for a moment.
""I think the village is that way,"" he said and pointed. ""Let's get the wood first.""
She nodded and started walking toward the place where the firewood was piled. She grabbed handfuls of the branches and stacked them neatly along one side of the dirt road.",1110,1.2896681722428895,1.5790382400905758,0.8794572177702813,1.763916950640682,1.960544193375415

A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""What is this place?"" asked Serenthia as she stepped off the boat onto the shore.
""It's called Fennel,"" said Arcturus. ""A town built around an old monastery."" He pointed to one of the towers. ""That tower belongs to the Order of St. George. They're our allies here. We'll stay there until we can get a message back home about what happened to us.""
Serenthia nodded but her eyes were still fixed on the town. ""I've never seen anything so…so…abandoned before.""
Arcturus smiled at her. ""Well, you won't have to wait long now. I'm sure that once we tell them what's happening in the north, they'll send someone down to help us.""
He started walking towards the gatehouse, followed closely by Serenthia. As he approached, he could hear the sound of voices coming from within. He knocked three times then waited patiently while the door opened.
A young man stood there wearing a brown robe and holding a wooden staff. His face was round and his hair was black and curly. He had a pleasant smile and a kind expression. ""Welcome to Fennel, travelers,"" he said. ""My name is Brother Jofrey. How may I help you today?""
""We need shelter for the night,"" said Arcturus. ""And we would also appreciate any information you might have regarding the state of affairs in the north.""
Jofrey nodded and gestured for them to follow him inside. Inside, the hall was empty except for a few people sitting at tables eating dinner. There was no sign of anyone else. Arcturus looked around the room trying to see if there were more people hiding somewhere, but there didn't seem to be.
""Where are all your guests?"" asked Arcturus.
""They left early this morning,"" replied Jofrey. ""There's been some unrest in the north lately, and many of them felt it wasn't safe to stay here anymore.""
""Is there anywhere we can stay tonight?"" asked Serenthia.
Jofrey shook his head. ""No. But you can sleep in the dormitories upstairs. There are only four rooms, but they should be large enough for you both.""
As soon as they were settled in their beds, Serenthia turned to Arcturus. ""Did you notice how quiet it was outside? I thought I heard something moving around but there was nothing there. And why did everyone leave so suddenly?""
""I don't know,"" said Arcturus. ""But I think we'd better get some rest. We can ask the brothers tomorrow.""
He lay back on his bed and closed his eyes. After a moment, he realized that Serenthia was lying next to him. She was staring at the ceiling, her lips slightly parted, her breathing slow and steady. Her skin was warm and soft under his hand. He ran his fingers across her cheek and down to her neck, feeling the smoothness of her skin beneath his palm.
She moaned softly and rolled over onto her back. ""Arcturus…""
His heart pounded in his chest as he reached out to touch her. He leaned forward and kissed her gently on the mouth, sliding his tongue between her lips. She responded immediately, pressing against him. For a brief instant, everything seemed to stop. Then she pulled away and sat up.
""Sorry,"" she said. ""I shouldn't have done that.""
Arcturus sat up too. ""Don't be sorry,"" he whispered. ""I liked it.""
""I'm not sure that I do,"" she said.
""Why not?""
""Because I'm a priestess.""
""You're not a priestess right now,"" said Arcturus. ""Not unless you want to be.""
Her eyes widened. ""Are you serious?""
""Yes.""
""Then I accept your offer.""
""Good,"" said Arcturus. ""Now come here.""
He took her into his arms again, kissing her deeply. This time she responded eagerly, wrapping her legs around his waist and pulling him closer. When they finally came up for air, he slid his hands down her body and cupped her breasts in his palms. She groaned softly and arched her back.
""Do you feel that?"" he asked. ""I can feel the power flowing through me.""
""It's beautiful,"" she said. ""I've never felt anything like it before.""
""Neither have I,"" said Arcturus. ""But I intend to make the most of it.""
Serenthia smiled and pressed herself against him, running her hands over his shoulders and chest. Arcturus felt a sudden surge of energy flow through his body and he pushed her back on the bed.
He climbed on top of her and began to kiss her neck and shoulders, sucking on her fleshy nipples. She moaned and writhed beneath him, her hips undulating against his own. He moved lower, kissing her stomach and thighs, then slowly lowered himself between her legs.
When he touched her, she cried out and gripped his head tightly in her hands. He licked her gently, tasting the saltiness of her arousal.
""Oh, yes!"" she gasped. ""Please! Please, Arcturus, please!""
He smiled and pressed his lips to hers. The taste of her blood filled his mouth and he drank greedily, drawing her essence into him. It was sweet and strong and made him feel alive. He sucked harder, drinking more and more until her moans became louder and more desperate.
Finally, he stopped feeding. She whimpered and arched her back, pushing her hips upwards.
""More,"" she begged. ""Give me more.""
Arcturus smiled and kissed her again, taking her blood into his mouth and swallowing it whole. She shuddered and moaned beneath him and he continued to drink until she fell limp in his arms.
""That was amazing,"" she murmured. ""Thank you.""
Arcturus smiled and lay down beside her. ""I enjoyed it too.""
""I'm glad.""
They lay together quietly for a while, listening to the sounds of the other monks moving about in the hallway. Finally, Serenthia spoke.
""How will we get home?"" she asked. ""We don't have any money. Or any way to pay for passage.""
Arcturus sighed. ""I wish I knew. All I can say is that we'll figure something out.""
""If we can't return home, where do you plan to go?""
""To the capital city of Egorian,"" he said.",1077,0.39023035509601706,0.15386693904048995,0.2898215628749247,1.4974448650575953,-0.6217781279476778

""Well this looks suspicious enough,"" said Grumph. He had his hand on his sword, which he hadn't even drawn yet.
""It does look quite peaceful,"" agreed Dirk. ""There are no bodies lying about though.""
""Maybe they all got away in time. The trouble is, we're not exactly dressed for the occasion. We need to find out what happened here before we can do anything else.""
""Agreed,"" said Rufus. ""I'll see if I can sneak up to one of the towers and take a peek inside.""
The wyvern was already on its way. As soon as Rufus left sight, Dirk took a deep breath.
""Okay, everyone stay here. This is going to get rough, so just hang tight for a few moments. When the time comes, you will need to keep low and try to remain unseen. If anyone sees us, the mission's failed and we have no choice but to flee.""
Dirk and Rufus ducked down behind a row of trees as soon as they were close enough. The trees grew thick there, and a good hiding place.
Rufus paused only briefly, long enough to peer over the lip of the tower. His nose twitched as he spotted a couple of horses tied up nearby, but that wasn't what made him stop. It was a man lying near the edge of the building, sprawled out face-up in front of the window with a bloody knife sticking out of his back.
A young girl wearing a stained white dress knelt beside the corpse, her eyes wide with horror.
Rufus felt something tugging at his chest, some sense of familiarity he couldn't quite place. The girl glanced up as she heard his approach, her brown eyes huge and frightened. He recognized those eyes now, although he still didn't know where from.
""Hello,"" Rufus said as he stopped. ""Don't be alarmed, I mean you no harm.""
Her expression softened, and she dropped the knife in her hand before taking a step away from the body. Rufus wanted to make sure she knew that she had nothing to fear from him.
""I'm Rufus. Are you all right?""
He put a comforting hand on her shoulder and looked into her eyes again.
""It's okay. No one is going to hurt you.""
She nodded but kept staring at him with wide eyes. It was odd for a little kid her age to look so much like a terrified rabbit, but it wasn't the strangest thing Rufus had seen this day.
""Do you know who killed him?""
The girl shook her head.
""My name is Fay,"" she said after a moment. ""My father called me Faye. Father always told me not to go outside alone, but he went with them to market and left us behind. Now he's dead!""
She covered her mouth as she began to cry, but Rufus quickly held her arms down and waited until she regained control.
""Is there anyone else in the village? Are you sure there's no one else hurt?""
Fay nodded. She wiped at her eyes and sniffled. ""No. I don't think so. I saw only that man. Everyone else is gone. We never thought to lock the doors or leave a guard behind.""
Rufus stood and turned to look back at the building. It wasn't possible to see inside, but it didn't seem as though anyone was waiting around. He walked up to the body and studied it.
""Whoever killed him seems to be long gone, but we have to find out why he did it. I suppose you'll need to come along if we're going to find out anything.""
Faye nodded again.
""I would be grateful to you,"" she said. ""You can't imagine what my life has been like lately.""
Rufus couldn't even begin to guess. She looked far too young for something like this, and he could tell by her eyes that she had seen more than her fair share of horrible things.
He pulled the dagger from the corpse's back, then quickly scanned the ground. The killer hadn't been fast enough to get very far, so he should have no problem tracking them down.
""Let's get out of here and start looking,"" he said, herding the girl down the path toward the village. ""We may not find anything, but at least we might learn something useful.""
Fay glanced over her shoulder nervously once as they went, but Rufus didn't pay it much mind. At the very least, he hoped to be able to show Faye that there was still good in the world. If nothing else, maybe she wouldn't be afraid of him anymore.
They continued to make their way down the path until they arrived at a clearing. A wooden house sat in the center, surrounded by gardens with large pots full of plants. Rufus spotted two people walking towards them, both dressed in dirty clothing.
The man wore a stained gray tunic and a leather belt across his chest. His hair was long and greasy, and the top of his head was covered by a thick growth of dirt. His companion appeared to be wearing some sort of cloak made out of animal hide. She carried an empty basket over her arm and wore an expression of confusion as she turned to look back at the village.
Rufus knew the man before he even saw his face. He was the local priest and had been leading prayers in the village square every evening for some time now.
""Father!"" cried Rufus as he ran up to him, the little girl following close behind. ""Thank goodness you're all right!""
""I'm sorry to interrupt,"" the man said as he looked down at the dead body. ""But I have no idea how we can continue to perform our prayers when this sort of thing is happening.""
""No one has any idea,"" said Rufus, trying to sound soothing. ""Now please, let's get inside so we can discuss what happened.""
The priest nodded.
""Come on, then, let's go find your daughter and see if she needs help.""
Fay followed along silently, clutching Rufus's hand. The priest and Dirk both kept looking at her in surprise. It was clear to Rufus that they were thinking she was a little girl who was far too young to be helping with such important business. He wasn't sure why the priest looked so shocked though.
Rufus glanced down at the girl once more. She was standing there, looking at the corpse and shaking, but he couldn't blame her for being afraid. She had been through a lot lately, and Rufus felt a twinge of guilt knowing that she had seen things she shouldn't have.
""Where's your mother?"" he asked Fay as they entered the house.",1195,0.19043170127033443,-0.2815563380551183,-0.3756487219650568,-0.8465091150583318,0.5971708124511144
121,R_12zPB6INQyY4tJm,MOR_HR_9,Historical Romance,Morpho,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The tavern was almost empty, with only a few patrons scattered around the room. She was a young, pretty thing, perhaps nineteen or twenty years old. She wore a plain brown skirt and a white blouse with a blue ribbon at her neck. A small purse hung from her shoulder. He could see that she had auburn hair and green eyes.
She was young, but she was beautiful, and he knew at once that he would love her. He didn't say anything to the young man who brought him his ale, but he had been watching her for a while, and he knew that she didn't belong there. He watched her for a while longer, thinking about what he would do when the tavern closed and she left. As it turned out, she was the only person to remain in the tavern after everyone else had left. He watched her closely as she drank her ale. He was fascinated by the way she moved. She looked so delicate, so graceful. He could see her clearly even though the room was dark and his eyesight was poor.
He wondered how she could possibly be there by herself. She didn't fit the tavern's usual clientele; no one like her came there. No one like her ever had. He tried to imagine how it could be that she had ended up in the tavern of all places. It just didn't make sense.
He thought about asking her about herself, but decided against it. He had never been very good at conversation, and he wasn't sure that he would have been able to carry on a conversation with her anyway. He was too shy, too awkward, and he didn't have the proper words to use in conversation. All he could think of to say was that she seemed so unusual for someone who had ended up in the tavern.
He knew that if he were to say that to her, she might just laugh at him, although he wasn't sure what kind of a reaction he would get from her if she actually did laugh at him. He would probably be embarrassed at having spoken to her at all, which would probably make him even more awkward than before. But he had to say something to her; he couldn't just let such a lovely woman sit there by herself any longer than he had already let her sit there for. Besides, it was almost time for him to close the tavern for the night, and if she were still sitting there when he closed up shop, he would be forced to stay open longer than usual in order to keep an eye on her. He really didn't think that would be good for business, and he didn't feel right about doing that anyway.
The young woman drank her ale quietly for a while longer. Then she stood up and went outside into the cold evening air. As soon as she stepped outside, she paused and looked around the street. Then she quickly went back inside the tavern and disappeared into one of the back rooms. The young man came back with another ale; the man waved him off before he could pour it down the young man's throat, which was almost empty anyway. Then the man picked up a wooden bowl and went over to a box on one of the tables where the young woman had been sitting earlier in the day. He took some coins from her purse and placed them into the box, then picked up the box and carried it back into his room at the back of the tavern.
The man watched as the young woman stood up and approached him again. She looked frightened; he could see that clearly now that he could see her face clearly in the light from the windows. She looked frightened because he was a stranger to her; she didn't know who he was or where he had come from. She probably thought that he was going to hurt her somehow or do something bad to her. She probably thought that she ought to run away from him right then and there and get away from him as quickly as possible. But she didn't run away; instead, she came closer to him for some reason.
""I'm sorry I scared you,"" he said gently to her as soon as she came close enough for him to see her face clearly without having to squint at her because of what little light there was in the tavern that night. ""I'm afraid I startled you when you came out of your room earlier today.""
The young woman looked up at him curiously, as if she had never seen him before in her life or maybe not even known that he existed before that moment that he had spoken to her inside the tavern earlier in the day. ""It's all right,"" she said softly as she sat down again at one of the tables near him. ""I guess I haven't been spending enough time at home lately.""
""Where are you from?"" asked the young man cautiously as soon as she seated herself once more at the table in front of him. He realized that perhaps his tone sounded too abrupt for his liking but decided not to worry about it right then because it wasn't like it was really his fault anyway, considering how strange he'd felt when she had come out of nowhere earlier in the day and scared him half out of his wits. ""I've never seen you before.""
The young woman shook her head gently again as if she were trying to shake off an unpleasant memory from somewhere deep inside of herself. She looked down at her hands as if they were suddenly completely unfamiliar objects to her. ""I can't remember,"" she said softly as tears filled her eyes once more as they usually did when she thought about where she had come from or who she had been before she'd arrived here in this world or wherever it was that they were now together in this strange place together together in this strange place together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situatio
""Are you sick?"" asked the young man gently as soon as he saw that tears were forming in the corners of her beautiful eyes once more because they usually did whenever she thought about where she'd come from or who it was that might have raised her or brought her here or brought her here or brought her here before this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world

122,R_SZ5xQKHwNjYc3Wp,ALL_HSF_3,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The president of the United States wanted me to see him. The idea of talking with him made my skin crawl. He'd been elected on a wave of populism, promising to bring jobs back to America. And while he hadn't been as successful at that as he might've hoped, he had succeeded at one thing: making enemies of all the people who worked for him.
As soon as I reached the lobby, I checked in with the security guard and took the elevator up to the president's floor. When I stepped out of the lift, I was greeted by a wall of people standing behind barricades, many of them carrying signs that said things like, ""We are not terrorists,"" and ""Stop the invasion.""
The guards were wearing riot gear, but I could tell they weren't planning to do much more than push the crowd back if necessary. They had the protesters penned up against the glass doors, which led into the building. As I approached, they began to chant, ""Out! Out!"" and ""Shame on you!""
I walked through the line and headed straight for the door leading to the president's office. A Secret Service agent stood in front of it, blocking my way.
""You can't go any further, sir,"" he said. ""This area is closed off.""
""I need to see the president,"" I told him.
He glanced at his watch. ""Sir, you have fifteen minutes.""
I took a step closer. ""That's not enough time. We need to talk now.""
The agent raised his baton and tapped it against his thigh. ""I'm afraid you're going to have to leave, sir. You'll be allowed back in once you're done with your meeting with the president.""
""No,"" I said. ""You have to let me through. He has something he needs to say to me.""
""Mr. President will speak to you after his meeting, sir."" The agent stepped forward, placing himself between me and the door. ""And if you don't leave now, we'll be forced to take you in by force.""
I clenched my fists. ""You wouldn't dare.""
The agent didn't respond as he pressed the button on the wall. ""Security to the president's office, please.""
I took a step forward and looked up at the man who'd been elected to lead the country. ""You're going to regret this.""
""Get out of here, Mr. Walker,"" the agent ordered, and then pushed me out of the way.
I turned around and started walking toward my car. Once I got there, I sat down in the driver's seat and stared out at the protesters gathered outside the building. I couldn't believe that I was going to lose my job over something that had nothing to do with me. It didn't matter how many people I talked to or how much I pleaded my case to the president, I'd never get a second chance to fix what I'd done.
I thought about going back inside and asking to see the president one last time before I left Mars forever, but the look on his face when he saw me would haunt me for the rest of my life.
I turned on the ignition and started driving away. There were so many things I wanted to say to him, so many questions I needed to ask. But I knew they'd never have an answer, no matter how much I begged or pleaded with him. And deep down, I was okay with that.
I drove out of the city and headed into the desert, where I could see the mountains rising up from behind them. The air felt fresh, the sun warm against my skin, and I breathed it in deeply, letting all my troubles wash away with every exhale.
I stopped the car at the side of the road, climbed out, and began walking toward the horizon, leaving Mars behind me for good.
I stood there in silence for a while, watching as the sun slowly sank below the horizon. The sky turned a bright pink and then orange before finally turning dark purple. Stars appeared in the heavens above me, and the wind picked up, blowing sand across my face.
I turned around and looked at the city once more, this time from far away, and felt a strange sense of relief wash over me. There were still people living there—a few thousand of them, anyway. I hoped they'd be safe until the war was over.
I got back in the car and drove toward the mountains, heading for a place where no one would find me. A place where I could finally start my new life.

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to see President Hernandez today. I had just spent five years trying to stop the war he was waging against humanity. But there was no point in putting off what needed doing. So I made my way toward the presidential offices.
When I stepped inside the building I went straight up to the security guard stationed at the door, who nodded at me. He gave me the all clear to go on in. The interior was just like any other government office; it felt cold and sterile. When I arrived at the receptionist desk she smiled at me.
""Good morning, Mr. Stone,"" she said cheerfully, taking the envelope. She tore it open and pulled out a small piece of paper that read: ""See me in my office as soon as you can."" As she handed the note to me I could see her eyebrows lift slightly at the handwriting on the outside of the envelope.
She handed it to me and looked at me questioningly. ""Dr. Sato said this was for you."" I shrugged and gave her a tight smile. ""I suppose so. Thanks."" I turned away from her to get to President Hernandez's office.
There were several people in the outer waiting area when I got to the president's office. Most of them were tourists and politicians with their entourages. There were also several news cameras lined up against one wall. As I approached the receptionist she stepped out from behind her counter and moved to block my path.
""Mr. Stone, we've been informed by the Secret Service that you are not to enter the president's office today,"" she said, looking me up and down with an assessing expression. ""You have a meeting scheduled with General Lea."" I sighed and nodded before turning around and walking back through the door that led outside. The Secret Service men saw me and stepped in front of me to prevent me from entering the waiting area again.
""Sir, you're not going to get in,"" said one of the men in uniform. ""I'm afraid you'll just have to wait here. We can't let anyone pass in or out of the president's office."" He took his hand off his holster as he spoke. I stopped and stared at him.
""So...you won't let me meet with the president?"" I asked the man. I didn't raise my voice but I could tell by the way the Secret Service agents bristled at my words that they weren't happy about it.
""Sir, it would be better if you waited for the next group,"" said the second agent. His tone was clearly patronizing and condescending. ""You shouldn't cause any trouble. You are simply too famous."" He chuckled. ""If you'd like to see President Hernandez, please contact the office directly."" I stepped forward and grabbed the arm of the agent who was speaking to me, pulling him close to my face. ""Fuck you, man. Don't you think it's time to let me in?"" I growled. The men behind me began to form a circle around me to try and keep me away from the agents, who were still smiling.
""Sir, I don't think the president will want to meet with you,"" said the man. I released his arm and glared at him. ""This is not your decision, sir. It's the president's."" I shook my head and stepped back. ""All right, then. Enjoy your day, Mr. Stone. Thank you for coming in."" I turned around and walked toward my waiting car.
There were several news reporters waiting for me outside as soon as I got to my car. I ignored them and climbed inside. I drove away from the building, heading north and out of town toward the mountains. I needed to get clear of the city for a while; it was too much for me to handle.
When I arrived at the house I rented I called Dr. Sato and told her that I wasn't going to be able to make our meeting. She said she'd tell the president. Then she hung up on me. I knew it was only a matter of time before he sent an angry message to my cell phone. I didn't even bother looking at it; I just put it in a drawer and got to work.
I spent most of the afternoon working on the computer, writing code for new software. It wasn't enough to change the outcome of things but I knew it would make a difference if I could use the code to help guide our people to safety. But no matter how hard I tried, nothing seemed to work. My mind kept circling back to what it had felt like to see my father die before my eyes. I hadn't been able to save him and it haunted me.
When night fell I was exhausted. I took a shower and ate dinner alone. I was still trying to figure out the best way to distribute the code I had created. The president was wrong; I was not simply ""too famous."" But I was also powerless against him. And there was nothing I could do to change that.
The next morning I got out of bed early and headed to the lab in hopes of getting some more work done. I was feeling much better about the situation by the time I arrived. I didn't know what the next step was but I figured I would figure something out. After all, the president wasn't going to stop me from doing anything I wanted, right?
As I walked into the lab a man sat on one of the sofas, staring at me. I blinked in surprise and then realized that it was Jason. He had his arm around a pretty young blonde. ""Hey, Stone,"" he said, waving to me. ""How've you been?""
""Uh, good, Jason. How's things?""
He smiled. ""Good. I'm just here to see Dr. Sato.""
""Oh, I'm not here,"" I replied. ""I'm sorry, Jason."" I tried to turn away to walk toward the door but Jason grabbed my arm.
""Come on, man,"" he said. ""Let's have a drink."" He put his hand on my shoulder to lead me toward the door. The girl looked up at me with a smile and winked. She reached out for my hand and I pulled back, looking down at her.
""Jason, let go of me,"" I demanded.
""Why? It's only going to be a drink or two."" Jason gave me a pained look and pulled on my arm again. ""Come on, man, don't get so weird about this."" I pulled away from him and walked toward the door. The girl grabbed my arm but Jason stepped between us.
""Stop it, Jason,"" he growled. He shoved Jason backward, making him stumble to the ground. When he fell he let out a yell. The girl started crying. I stood there stunned. I turned to face Jason. His face was red with rage.",1227,-0.5034015826778558,-0.5538148128668021,-0.45948916543998214,0.8141826491948626,0.9430199911021324
124,R_3PazTQmXcOiTdFa,ALL_HF_5,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""A town?"" said Alusair.
""I don't recognize it,"" said Gurgle, ""but I do know that it's far away from here.""
Alusair frowned. ""That can only mean one thing. This is where they came from, not where they are going. If this is their starting point, then we have found their base.""
""And a town too!"" added the dragon. ""They must be hiding somewhere nearby.""
""Let us see what we can learn from these people,"" said Alusair. ""We will go inside and speak with them. If there is a wizard among them, he will likely know something about their leader and how to find him.""
The group approached the gate and found that it was open. They entered into a street lined with homes of wood and stone. No one was about, however. All the windows were shuttered.
""This place looks abandoned,"" said Gurgle.
Alusair nodded. ""It seems that way, but I have my doubts. It may be that the residents are gone and their belongings taken. We'll search a bit."" She moved toward one house that seemed more inhabited than others.
She stopped short at the sight of a dead man lying in the middle of the yard, his throat cut open. He was dressed in the clothes of a peasant. A woman's dress hung from one of his lifeless hands, its fabric soaked with blood.
""Oh no…"" she murmured.
Alusair walked to the side of the house, where the body lay. She pulled her sword free from its scabbard and held it before her, ready to strike. ""Stay back. Something's not right here.""
""You're right, lady,"" said Gurgle, taking a cautious step backward. ""I sense magic.""
""I agree,"" said the dragon. ""Something very strange has happened here.""
""Perhaps they have been taken by the same monster that killed the soldiers,"" suggested Alusair. ""We should look for others like this one.""
""What are you going to do?"" asked Gurgle. ""Knock on every door and ask if they've seen anything?""
""No, of course not,"" she replied. ""That would be too obvious. Let us see if we can find some sign that they were all killed in the same manner.""
""Like blood splatters?""
""Exactly,"" she said, walking around the body. Blood had dried in the grass around him and stained his clothing, but it was not as dark as it might have been if he'd died recently. She found another stain nearby, this time on the stone wall.
""Look at that!"" said Alusair, pointing with her blade. ""Blood was drawn from him, then painted on the wall. This man was murdered in a ritualistic way, probably by someone wielding magic.""
""But who?"" asked Gurgle. ""And why?""
""We'll need to find out,"" said Alusair, stepping up to the body and feeling for a pulse. She could feel nothing, and knew that there was no hope of reviving him. ""There is more to learn here. I think we should look elsewhere.""
The group headed toward the end of the street, where it met the shoreline of the lake. There was a dock with several boats tied up at its edge. Most of them looked as though they had not been used in years. Some were even broken and half-sunk. The dragon landed on the water and floated over to a large vessel that was still intact. He reached inside and pulled out a rope, which he then used to tie himself in place.
""I'll be ready when you return,"" he said. ""Just make sure you come back.""
Alusair nodded and started to walk away from the dock. Suddenly, something struck her from behind and sent her flying into the water. Her sword clattered on the dock. She came to rest with her head bobbing above the surface, her eyes open. She struggled to get to the top, but found herself being held down by someone who had a hand over her mouth and nose. She tried to scream, but it was as though she were underwater.
""Stop struggling, little girl,"" said a voice. ""You're going to drown soon enough.""
She tried to kick but was held down too tightly. She looked around and saw that a large man stood over her, holding her by the throat with one hand and the back of her neck with the other. His eyes were wide and filled with madness, his face pale and twisted in terror. A long black cloak covered most of his body. It was the same creature that had attacked the soldiers outside the city gates.
""Let me go!"" she screamed, her lungs burning for air.
""Be quiet or I'll kill you right now,"" said the monster.
She could feel the strength of the creature's grip on her neck, and knew that she would die if he let go. Alusair fought harder, kicking and thrashing as much as she could. The man's eyes widened as he looked down at her. ""Why are you fighting so hard? You want to live, don't you?""
""Please…"" she gasped. ""I… I just want to go home.""
""Well, you're going to have to do a lot more than beg before I release you."" He tightened his grip even further, and she felt herself being dragged beneath the water. She tried to call out for Gurgle and the dragon, but no sound came out of her mouth.
Suddenly, the pressure on her neck eased, and she found herself gasping for breath again. She turned her head to find the man gone. She kicked and paddled toward the shore, finally reaching the surface and taking a deep breath. Her head ached, and she had difficulty seeing. She swam to the dock where she had fallen and climbed onto the wood planks. Gurgle landed on the edge of the water and approached her.
""Are you all right?"" he asked. ""What happened?""
Alusair sat on the dock, looking around. There was no sign of the man who had attacked her or anyone else.
""Did he say anything?"" asked Gurgle. ""Anything at all?""
She shook her head. ""I can't remember a word he said. He spoke too quickly, like someone trying to hide his voice.""
Gurgle nodded. ""We need to go back to the town and warn the others.""
""They will already know,"" replied Alusair. ""The man we saw must be their leader. I doubt that he is alone.",1129,-1.248371952167698,-1.010985449009102,0.764260058652112,1.6945542084730145,-0.10660770633100758
125,R_OCn5ia7c8tIzxol,GEN_HR_10,Historical Romance,Genesis,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been so busy, serving drinks to all the people who came by that she had startled him. His eyes hadn't left her as they'd talked for an hour or more about nothing. Finally he couldn't stand it any longer and blurted out how beautiful she was. Then he'd gone back to his work without even getting her name.
He wondered if she would be there tomorrow. The next day when he arrived with the beer, she wasn't seated at the table. But then three days later she was again sitting right in front of him, talking excitedly to herself. Her voice brought him up short; he looked down and noticed that she was wearing men's clothing, which fit her perfectly but didn't seem quite right on a woman.
A week after she started coming to the tavern, he learned why. A young man—a servant boy—who worked for the tavern owner had been found murdered and dumped under some bushes near an old graveyard. It appeared he'd been killed because he knew something important about the tavern's business and someone wanted to keep it secret. The tavern keeper was furious with him, blaming him for what happened to his boy. He threatened to fire the boy if he ever saw him again.
So now this woman—as he still thought of her—was visiting the tavern every single evening. She ate dinner with everyone else and stayed until closing time, then disappeared. No one asked her questions. They were too afraid of the tavern keeper and the trouble he could cause them if they did. So no one made any effort to find out anything about her. And after two weeks she stopped coming to the tavern altogether.
The next day, however, he saw her standing in the middle of the street, looking around. She seemed lost. That was odd; none of the other women who frequented the tavern wore men's clothing. He hurried over to her and called out, ""Are you all right?""
She turned toward him and stared, as though trying to focus on his face. When she finally realized he was speaking to her, she said softly, ""Yes. Thank you."" Then she continued to stare at him, as if not sure whether or not he really existed.
""Do you live nearby? Maybe I can help you find your way home,"" he offered tentatively.
Her eyes searched his face again, and this time she nodded. ""I am lost. I've never been here before. Please let me stay with you tonight.""
He didn't know what to do. Should he take her to his house? No, that was probably forbidden. If the tavern keeper caught them together, both of them would be fired from their jobs. But he didn't want to just leave her standing there, so he shrugged his shoulders helplessly. ""Well … I'll have to ask my father, but I'm sure we can find room for you.""
""Thank you,"" she murmured, then hurried off, leaving him to wonder what to do next.
But when he returned to the tavern the next day, it was obvious to him that his father already had a plan. Before he even entered the building, he heard his father's booming voice calling out, ""Cedric!""
He turned and ran toward the sound of his father's call. As he approached the door, Cedric heard his father say, ""Go get her.""
Cedric hesitated only a moment before hurrying away. He knew exactly where to find her—she'd been standing in the same spot outside the tavern ever since he'd seen her the previous night.
When he walked up to her, she looked startled. ""What are you doing here?"" she demanded angrily.
""My father told me to bring you inside,"" he replied, stepping forward to place his hand on the small of her back. ""You can stay with us tonight. You're welcome to stay here forever. We don't care.""
She stopped and stared at him. ""Why would anyone ever want to stay in a place like this?""
""Because we love it,"" he said simply.
""And you?"" she asked. ""Do you want to live with these people?""
""Of course I do! Why wouldn't I?"" he asked, surprised. ""This is my family, my home. This is where I belong.""
She looked up at him with those eyes that seared into him. For the second time that day, he felt his heart skip a beat.
""Did you hear what I said?"" she asked quietly. ""I'm staying with you tonight. My name is Greta.""
Then she took a deep breath, stepped past him and went inside the tavern.
Cedric watched her go in, wondering what to do next, and then followed her inside.
He was amazed. His father had done everything he possibly could to make her feel at home. Even though she was a stranger, they treated her as a member of the family. She sat down at the table where everyone always ate their meals, and his father said, ""Cedric, can you get me a chair from the kitchen?""
""Yes, Father,"" he answered, then hurried off to fetch a chair.
Greta had eaten her meal and was washing her dishes when he returned carrying the chair. She looked up at him and smiled. ""Thank you, Cedric. Would you like to join me?""
He blinked. ""Would I like to—?""
""Sit down and eat with us,"" she finished for him.
He set the chair down next to hers and sat down, but he barely touched his food. He kept staring at her, unable to believe that she was actually sitting with them.
She reached out and placed her hand on his arm. ""Don't be shy, Cedric. Eat your dinner.""
He looked at her hand, then slowly extended his own. She took it, and he felt warm and safe. For the first time in his life, he had someone who cared for him, someone he could trust.
His father noticed his disquiet. ""Is something wrong, Cedric?""
""No,"" he answered quickly. ""I'm fine. It's just … well, I've never had anyone touch me before. Not like this.""
She laughed. ""Oh, you poor child!""
He blushed and looked down at his plate. ""It's not funny, Mother.""
She chuckled. ""All children must learn to stand on their own feet someday. Now sit up and finish your supper.""
Cedric did as she said, but he didn't enjoy the meal. All he could think about was Greta. His father noticed how distracted he was and asked him gently, ""What's wrong?""
""Nothing."" But his voice sounded defensive, so he added, ""I'm just tired. I'm going to bed early tonight.""
""Okay,"" his father agreed. ""Come to me when you wake up in the morning.",1148,-0.8463848658564171,-1.003997009368876,0.366871499112793,-0.056010274074509966,-0.8353422841722973
126,R_2v6QtYpAY7s8OYK,MOR_HR_1,Historical Romance,Morpho,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. She was sitting with a group of women, and their laughter and chatter and the sound of their voices had been so loud, he hadn't been able to hear himself think. But when she stood up to leave, he'd seen her face. And he had thought he had died and gone to heaven. She was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.
She was tall and thin, but her waist was tiny, and her hips were full and curved. She had long, lustrous black hair, and her skin was so light it was practically white. She wore a dress that looked like a white ball gown, and her shoes matched it, the straps of a low-heeled pump fastened with a row of tiny pearls. Her arms were long and narrow, and her hands were small, and she wore no rings, no necklace, no earrings, no bracelets. She had worn a simple silver bracelet on her right wrist, but she'd taken it off as soon as she sat down at the table.
She was very pale, almost as pale as the pale green silk that covered her from neck to toe. So pale that it seemed as if she might be ill or dying. And yet there was an air of confidence about her that made him think she wasn't ill at all.
She'd come into the tavern where he worked in Ketterdam, one of the busiest ports in all of the North. There were dozens of taverns, thousands of sailors working in the docks, and tens of thousands of people who came to Ketterdam to do business with the merchants who sold exotic goods or wanted to smuggle illegal goods into the country.
There was always a crowd in the city's taverns, but this particular tavern was always crowded, because they served the best coffee in the city. The coffee was made from beans imported from the South Sea Islands, and it wasn't easy to get a taste of it outside of Ketterdam. The tavern's tables were stacked high with plates of food—sausages and smoked fish and cheeses and salads—but most people came for the coffee.
He was working behind the bar when they came in. They were a group of six women who looked like they were on their way somewhere important—the man closest to him didn't have a single bruise or scratch on his face—and they sat down at a table in front of him. One by one they ordered two cups of coffee—one for each of them—and one cup for him to pour for them from the pot over his left shoulder.
The man sitting closest to him looked familiar, but he couldn't place him right away. As soon as the man had ordered their coffees—for which he had paid with more gold coins than he had ever seen in one place before—he'd turned around to look at him. The man had been short and stocky with a neatly trimmed beard and short blond hair that stood out against his pale face. It looked as if he'd been out in the sun for too long without a hat on or an umbrella to shade his head, but that wasn't unusual for a man who spent most of his time in Ketterdam's ports or on ship's decks. But what had surprised him most about this man was his eyes. They were large and round, with thick eyelashes framing them. The man had stared at him for a moment before turning away, but even though he couldn't see this man's face clearly, he knew this was the first person he'd ever met who looked like him.
And then they were gone, all six of them, leaving him with three uneaten plates of food on their table and their empty cups on their table. He'd been so surprised by their departure that he hadn't even bothered to ask them their names or where they were going.
The next morning he was washing dishes when he saw her again. She was wearing a dress that matched her shoes and had a long train that trailed behind her as she walked toward his table where he was working.
By then he knew exactly who she was—a woman from one of the richest families in the city—and he felt uncomfortable looking at her while she sat down across from him and ordered her breakfast from his tray. She didn't look at him at all, but she didn't seem to mind having him serve her food either. She ate it quietly while she talked to a man she'd been sitting with at one of the other tables until he stood up to leave when she paid for their coffees with another gold coin.
He didn't know what it was about her that made him so nervous that day, but when she walked away from him toward one of the tavern's doors, he was afraid that if she left without seeing his face, he might never see her again. He wanted to look up at her as she walked past him so that she could see how tall and strong and handsome he was, but he didn't dare move because he thought she might see him looking up at her if he did. And then she stopped walking and turned around slowly before looking at him for the first time. He felt as if his heart had stopped beating for a moment when she looked at him through those large gray eyes that were so much like his own. He wanted so badly to speak to her even though he didn't know what to say to her because nothing seemed more important than saying something to her, but then she turned around and walked through the door behind her before disappearing out into Ketterdam's streets with those slender white legs trailing behind her like silk ribbons.
He'd never forget how she looked at him then or how beautiful she was in that dress with those long legs and those small feet slipping into those high-heeled shoes as if they belonged there instead of on those long limbs that seemed so fragile compared to those big eyes that stared into his soul with such intensity that he thought it might shatter into pieces if she looked harder at him than she already had.
He knew this woman must have thought him strange because he didn't know what to do when she left without speaking to him or even looking at him again after that first time. He'd watched all six of them come into the tavern that morning because they were important people from one of the wealthiest families in the city, but once they left they were gone from his mind forever even though he knew they would probably be back tomorrow or the next day or the next week because they were always coming here or going somewhere else in Ketterdam on business.
But all of those men weren't like him—they didn't look like him—and so those women were important people who went places where no one looked like them because no one looked like them anywhere else in all of Ketterdam except for him.
He couldn't stop thinking about them until the next time they came into his tavern or one like it where everyone looked different from one another because then he could see what it felt like when someone looked at him with those wide gray eyes as if they belonged there instead of on their faces where they sat in front of them ordering coffees or food from him because no one else did anything like that for them except for him because no one else did anything like that for anyone except for him because no one else did anything like that anyway except for him because only he did things like that because no one else did anything like that at all except him because no one else did anything like that except him because no one else did anything like that except for him because no one else did anything like that at all except him because no one else did anything like that except for him because no one else did anything like that except for him because no one else did anything like that...
But then one day after waiting there for hours hoping that they would come back into his tavern so that he could look at them again before they left Ketterdam forever when they came in laughing with their heads together again as if they were planning something important but not important enough for them to stop laughing long enough to give him their names so that he could remember them forever after this day...",1499,-0.2885843205968783,-0.007525385191479126,-1.9397122185591578,-1.9319044774621246,-1.03248979768736
127,R_2V7UPyDUmRAIUVs,OUR_HSF_3,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The president wanted us to talk to him? Why now? We'd just finished a ten-week mission, which had been anything but successful. He didn't need to hear our problems right away. And he wasn't the type who enjoyed talking things through, so a meeting probably wouldn't go well.
Maybe it wasn't about us. Maybe they were having trouble with something else. No, that couldn't be the case. The president hadn't given us any warnings lately, and I didn't think the other departments would have found anything wrong, either. If he wanted to tell them what was going on, he could have done so in a letter or an e-mail.
I looked down at my phone for the time and saw there were no messages waiting. The president hadn't called or sent us a text to meet, nor was anyone else on the team trying to reach us. What if someone had gotten in contact with me after the mission had ended? It seemed odd that none of them had tried to contact me. I knew they didn't know what happened when I was unconscious, but it seemed like they would still want to ask me a few questions about it.
My heart skipped a beat as I walked quickly toward the parking lot. Something had to be wrong, and it was all my fault. I had to find out what was going on, even though I was terrified that it could be about the mission. I didn't want to imagine what might have happened on Mars, and I certainly didn't want to explain to the president why we'd failed so spectacularly. But at the same time, I hoped it was only about something minor. Maybe one of the other team members had done something stupid while they were off-planet and they needed someone to take the fall.
I looked down at my phone again before turning the corner onto the street that led to the presidential palace. There was no missed call, and I hadn't gotten any emails from my family, either.
""Hello, Doctor Hoshino."" A man standing near the entrance to the presidential palace gave me a nod as I passed him by.
It was the president's secretary. The man had a short gray beard, which he kept well-trimmed. He also wore a long coat over a navy-blue shirt, and his suit looked like it cost more than any of my shirts. The man smiled kindly at me as if we were friends.
I stopped dead in my tracks, unsure how to react to the man. I hadn't been aware that the president had a personal assistant. There were rumors, of course, but none of us had ever met the guy, and we rarely went to his office. It wasn't like there were many opportunities for people to speak with the president. He met with the other departments on Mars and made occasional appearances on the news, but those were rare enough that the public didn't pay them much attention.
But today it felt like I'd run into the president's secretary on purpose.
""May I help you?"" His voice was warm and friendly, and it seemed out of place coming from a man wearing a tie and suit.
I couldn't say anything. I stood frozen, too afraid to even look at him. I was trying not to panic, but I also knew that whatever had happened, it wasn't good. Maybe they found something wrong with one of my experiments or something like that. Or maybe someone had died. Whatever the reason was, I knew I needed to know.
The man stood there and waited, and I finally realized he was waiting for a response. I still couldn't find the words.
""Are you okay?"" asked the secretary as he gave me a slight smile.
I took a deep breath and nodded quickly.
""Of course,"" he replied. ""You've just finished your mission, and I know how tired you must be.""
I managed to nod again, although it was more of a bobble.
He looked around as if he expected to see other people nearby, and when he didn't, I followed his gaze and saw that a number of the streetlights had gone out.
""Is there some sort of problem?"" I asked.
The secretary nodded and said, ""Yes, actually. The president is currently having a meeting in his office, and I need to ask you to come inside. I know that you're a busy person and didn't want to bother you with this, but he really wants to talk to you.""
I nodded once again, unable to speak, and started walking toward the palace.
""If you can make it quick, we'll get right down to business,"" said the man.
""What kind of business?"" I asked as I opened the door to the building, and my footsteps echoed loudly inside.
There was no one else there. The hallway was empty, and I followed the secretary into a large office and then to a small table with two chairs. I sat down in the chair opposite the man, who closed the door and took his place at the head of the table. He didn't look happy about whatever was going on.
""I don't have any idea what's wrong,"" I said quietly, staring into the man's eyes.
The secretary was watching me intently, which made me even more nervous. I couldn't believe he'd found me like this. What were they asking of me? ""How did you find me?""
""It's not important,"" he replied, his voice low and soft.
""I think it is,"" I insisted. ""We're all supposed to be keeping secrets from each other. We have our own missions to follow.""
I couldn't see him very well, but I could tell by the way he held himself that the man was angry. He seemed to take great offense to something, but I didn't know what it was. I kept my hands on the table, waiting for him to continue.
""We found you because the president needed someone to talk to,"" he finally said. His face was dark and serious, and I noticed he was shaking his head slowly. ""And he needed someone to answer some questions.""
I tried to swallow, but my mouth felt dry. I needed to figure out what he wanted from me. Was it about the mission? Had someone died? And if so, who? I'd been there for the entire mission, so it couldn't be about me. If the others had gotten hurt or killed, I'd already know. I sat motionless, and a number of questions raced through my mind, all of them leaving me in a panic.
""We don't know what happened during the mission, Doctor Hoshino,"" said the man as he looked up at me and then back down. ""We've only just received the message from the president, and we need your help to find out.""
The man's eyes seemed to bore into my soul as he waited for me to respond.",1224,0.25578140915314007,-0.10079772717891705,-0.015208200215966883,-0.2422105131927552,0.5268789661071984
128,R_1mq1D4FcS4IlFMB,ALL_HR_4,Historical Romance,All-Nighter,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been watching the men playing cards and drinking ale, trying to keep from staring at the beautiful young woman who was sitting there with them.
She was so very beautiful. The red hair that hung down to her shoulders, the golden-brown skin of her face, those bright blue eyes—he couldn't take his eyes off of her. His breath caught as she looked up from her drink and smiled at him. She seemed to know he was staring, but it didn't matter to her; she just gave him a little wave before turning back to the conversation she was having with the others seated around her.
He tried not to stare at her, but he could tell the men were all talking about him, how they hadn't seen anything like it before. ""Look at that pretty boy,"" one man said. ""He can't even look away when that woman walks by."" Another laughed. ""No doubt he's a virgin, and she'll be his first. He won't have a chance to get her home without losing his heart.""
He wanted to laugh along with them, but he couldn't. The way she looked at him made his stomach hurt. It was almost as if she knew he was looking at her. When the women walked by, she would give him a little smile before turning back to her friends.
She came back the next day. The same thing happened. She looked up at him whenever she passed by, and he always had to force himself to look away. That night, though, he found himself staring again. Her hair was pulled up, and the light caught on it as she moved. Her long, white dress swished out behind her, making him think of the water in the bayou. She seemed to move more gracefully than any of the women he'd seen before, and the way her body moved made his blood race through his veins.
The next time she came in, he made sure to sit right by her table. It wasn't long before she caught on, and she smiled at him again. This time, when she saw him staring, she put a hand on his arm.
""You're staring at me,"" she said.
He blushed, embarrassed that he hadn't been able to stop himself from watching her. ""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""It's just... you're so beautiful.""
She laughed. ""Well, thank you, I suppose. You're not bad-looking yourself.""
He felt his face heat up. ""Thank you,"" he said.
She leaned forward, lowering her voice. ""My name is Marie, and yours?""
""I'm Patrick. Patrick O'Sullivan.""
Her eyes widened slightly. ""Patrick? Are you Irish?""
""Yes, my family lives near there."" He didn't know why he had told her that. It seemed like he should have known better.
""I've never met an Irishman before,"" she said. ""What part of Ireland are you from?""
""I'm from Cork, in the south.""
She smiled. ""That's a lovely place. My grandmother grew up there. We used to visit her when we were young, and I remember how beautiful it was. So green."" She turned her head back toward the others at the table. ""Did you say you work here?""
""I do,"" he said. ""I clean tables.""
She gave him a small smile. ""It looks like you're very good at it. Did you train for that?""
He nodded. ""I did.""
""Then I guess I'll see you again tomorrow.""
He watched as she got up from her seat. She walked over to the men who had been sitting with her and started talking to them. When she came back, he could see that they were all looking at her. He thought about leaving, but he couldn't bring himself to go. He knew if he did, he'd regret it. He sat there watching her while she talked, and after she left, he couldn't take his eyes off of her.
She came back two days later, and she had brought some of her friends with her. The way she looked at him made him blush. She laughed at him, saying he was always staring at her. He felt so embarrassed that he had no choice but to leave.
When she came back the next day, she saw him and smiled. This time, when she was done with the men who had come with her, she walked over to him. ""Patrick,"" she said. ""Would you like to go out with me?""
He nodded, too surprised to say anything. ""Yes, ma'am.""
She laughed. ""You don't seem to know much about the ways of the world."" She put her hand on his arm and looked into his eyes. ""I'm asking you to take me home tonight. You can spend the night with me, if you want to.""
He nodded. ""Of course,"" he said. ""That sounds wonderful.""
The smile on her face grew bigger. She turned away and walked back over to where the others were sitting. After she left, he went over to the other table. It wasn't long before the men who had been sitting with her were laughing at him again, talking about how a girl as beautiful as Marie would have no trouble finding someone to take her home. They made fun of him for wanting to go with her. One man said that Patrick didn't even know what kind of girl she was; he thought she was just an innocent little thing.
They started calling him the Irish virgin. They teased him that he would be lucky if she took him home, because they all knew she wouldn't. When he heard them, he couldn't help but feel bad. He'd never seen another woman before, and she had asked him out.
But it didn't matter. None of it mattered, anyway. All he could think about was going home with her, taking her in his arms and holding her there.
""Patrick?"" Marie's voice pulled him out of his thoughts.
He looked up. She was standing in front of him. He smiled at her. ""Yes, ma'am?""
""Would you like to come home with me tonight? We could go by carriage, if you would rather not walk.""
He shook his head. ""I don't mind walking. I'll see you tomorrow?""
She nodded. ""Yes, of course.""
He turned to go. Before he got out of sight, though, one of the men from the other table called out to him. ""Hey, Patrick!""
He turned around and looked at the man. ""What is it?""
The man laughed. ""Don't be fooled. She's a whore, just like the rest of them. She'll probably be in bed with ten other men by the time you get her home.""
He wanted to tell them that he was no such thing, but he kept his mouth shut. Instead, he walked away.",1159,1.8499510560129209,-0.49177749217679423,-1.3854855062502707,-1.7878819034165698,1.2445329530791711

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature was still cool, but not cold enough to warrant wearing a coat or jacket. My breath formed white clouds as I walked down the street toward the main square.
The city itself had changed since I'd been last here. There were more people about, mostly workers who lived in the nearby buildings. They hurried by me without so much as acknowledging my existence. This wasn't unusual; most of them didn't even know who I was, let alone what I did. That made sense, though; I hadn't done anything noteworthy yet. Not until now.
I entered the main square and found myself surrounded by construction crews working on new buildings. The old ones had all burned down during the war, which meant they needed to be rebuilt from scratch. As I watched, one worker dropped something and bent to pick it up, only to get hit in the head by another worker swinging a hammer. He fell backward, landing hard on his backside. His fellow workers rushed over to help him to his feet. A few minutes later he was escorted away by security guards, while his colleagues continued their work.
This was the kind of thing I'd seen every day when I lived in Tokyo. People getting hurt because of careless mistakes, accidents caused by carelessness. It seemed like such a waste of life, especially considering how much time and effort went into making sure everything ran smoothly. But then again, maybe that was just human nature. We couldn't help ourselves sometimes, no matter how much we wanted to.
A woman dressed in a suit came running past me. She looked familiar, but I couldn't place where I knew her from. Then she turned around and waved at me. I smiled and nodded in response. She kept going, disappearing into the crowd. I shrugged and started walking again.
My phone rang as I passed through the gates leading into the city center. I pulled it out of my pocket and glanced at the screen. It was a number I didn't recognize, which probably meant it was someone calling from the government. I answered it anyway.
""Hello?"" I asked.
There was silence on the other end for several seconds before the voice spoke. ""Mr. Smith? This is President Shirogane.""
""Yes, sir,"" I replied.
""We've received your report on the situation in the South Pole.""
I stopped and turned around. The president himself was standing right behind me. I hadn't heard him approach. I could feel the eyes of the people passing us staring at me.
""Thank you for taking the time to come see me today,"" said the president. ""I'm glad you're here.""
I swallowed nervously. ""Of course, Mr. President. I'm always happy to assist if I can.""
He smiled. ""That's good to hear. Now, I have some news regarding the situation there.""
I waited patiently as he explained the details of the incident. I was surprised by how calm and collected he sounded. I would never have expected this level of professionalism from anyone else.
""So what are you planning to do next?"" I asked after the president finished speaking.
""Well, I want to send a team of scientists down there to investigate the anomaly,"" he said. ""They'll need to be able to withstand the cold temperatures, so I'm sending along a supply ship filled with equipment designed specifically for that purpose. And I'm also sending a military escort to make sure nothing happens to them. You will accompany them, Mr. Smith.""
""Yes, sir. I understand.""
""Good. In the meantime, I want you to continue monitoring the situation. If anything changes, I expect to hear about it immediately.""
""Understood, sir.""
""Very well. I look forward to hearing your reports in due time.""
With that, the president left. I stood there for a moment, trying to process everything I'd just been told. Then I headed home to pack.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would to prepare for the trip. I had to gather up all my winter gear, including gloves, boots, and a heavy parka. I packed plenty of food and water, too. I also bought a pair of snowshoes to help me navigate the ice fields. I figured it wouldn't be easy finding my way around, and I didn't want to risk getting lost in the dark.
When I finally arrived at the spaceport, it was almost sunset. I checked in with the security guard and gave him my ID card before heading inside. The airlock door closed behind me, sealing me off from the outside world. I stepped onto the bridge and sat down at the control panel.
""All systems go,"" I said.
""Roger that,"" replied the AI.
I took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. Then I pushed the button marked ""launch."" The engines fired up, and I felt the acceleration pull at my body. I was weightless for a second before the ship began moving.
After a minute or two, the bridge doors opened, allowing me to step out onto the deck. The wind was strong and frigid, blowing across the surface of the planet. I looked around and saw nothing but flat white ground stretching out into the distance. The sun had set hours ago, leaving the sky completely black. I turned back to the cockpit and pressed the button marked ""land.""
The ship descended quickly, and soon I was standing on solid ground once again. I climbed into the passenger compartment and strapped myself into the seat. Then I powered down the engines and waited for the transport ship to land.
Several minutes later, it touched down gently. I got out and stretched my legs. The cold air bit at my skin as I breathed in deeply. It smelled clean and fresh, like the forest after a storm. I turned around and looked out over the landscape. It was beautiful, and I couldn't wait to explore it.
I walked toward the entrance, which was covered by a large metal door. I reached out and grabbed the handle, pulling it open. Inside, I found myself in a small room with a desk and chair. There was a computer terminal on the desk, and I picked it up to check the time. It was 2:30 AM.
I turned to the AI and said, ""I'm ready to leave.""
""Roger that,"" replied the AI.
I put the terminal back down and walked out of the room. The door closed behind me. I stepped out into the night, and the cold air hit my face. I shivered slightly, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I'd expected. I guess I was used to the cold now.
I followed the path leading to the exit and emerged onto the surface of Mars. The sky was dark, with only a few stars visible overhead. I turned around and looked up at the sky again.",1210,-1.22797090797648,0.31874731794683764,0.8190900250606813,0.05167842043453202,0.6806193995822929

The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.

""I see it,"" said Ithamar. ""It looks like a nice place.""
""You've never been to the Vale before?"" asked Ithamar.

""I think I know why,"" said Ithamar, looking at the village. ""It looks very much like the Vale of the Silver Birch.""

""There's no one here,"" said Ithamar. ""You're right, Ayla. It isn't the Vale of the Silver Birch.""
""It does look similar,"" said Ayla, ""but it doesn't feel the same."" She paused and then she smiled. ""It feels like home.""
""Then this is where we are going to stay,"" said Ithamar.
Ayla nodded and smiled as she started down the road that led down to the lake. The two young people followed behind her and before they reached the lake they saw a large stone building sitting near its shore. They approached it cautiously and when they reached the door they could see that it was closed and locked.
""Halt!"" shouted a voice from within.
Ithamar and Ayla stopped in their tracks and turned around to face the door of the building. The voice was coming from within and they stood there for a moment before looking at each other for guidance.
""It's probably just a traveler who doesn't know which way to go,"" said Ithamar. He smiled at Ayla as he started toward the door, but she took his arm and stopped him. She looked at him with concern in her eyes and he understood how she felt. He had been inside a strange place once before and he remembered how he felt when he had been there.
""I'm sorry for this,"" she said, looking at him with tears in her eyes, ""but I don't want to go inside.""
Ithamar squeezed her hand and then took her hand in his as he followed her back to a spot on the road where they could talk in peace. He knew she meant well but he realized that she was terrified of being inside the building. He didn't blame her for it. It was exactly how he had felt when he was there. He felt a lump in his throat at the thought of entering the building and going back into that place that had once been his home. The lump in his throat grew larger when he remembered that he had left his parents there and that they might be dead by now.
He looked at Ayla with concern in his eyes as he asked her, ""Are you all right?""
Ayla nodded and said, ""Yes, I'm fine."" She looked away from him as if embarrassed by her reaction.
""What's wrong?"" asked Ithamar.
Ayla closed her eyes and said, ""I don't know how to explain it, but it's like a part of me knows that this place is where I belong."" She looked back at him as she continued, ""Not that I want to go inside,"" she added hastily, ""but it feels like I'm supposed to be here.""
Ithamar looked at her and could see that she was genuinely scared of going into the building so he took her hand again and led her forward to where the door was standing open. He pulled her inside and shut the door behind them before looking at her with concern in his eyes. She looked at him with a worried expression on her face as she said, ""It's okay, I can take it from here.""
""Are you sure?"" asked Ithamar.
Ayla nodded and then turned around to look at him as he said, ""I want you to stay here with me while we go into the building."" He saw a look of fear on her face as she nodded again so he put his hand on her shoulder and said, ""Don't worry; this is for your own safety."" He smiled as he added, ""If things get too bad, you can always run out the door,"" he said, pointing toward the open doorway at the far end of the room.
Ayla nodded but she didn't say anything else as they walked down the long corridor that led away from the entrance hall. It was clear to Ithamar that they were headed toward what he thought might be a dining hall for travelers who had come to stay at the Vale for a while. The walls were covered with paintings that depicted scenes from different parts of Orëska history, but as they passed a painting of warriors fighting against giants in what looked like a forest, Ayla began to look around nervously while clutching his hand so tightly that her nails dug into his palm like razors.
A few moments later they reached another door and Ayla stopped walking as she asked, ""What's wrong?"" She looked up at Ithamar with concern in her eyes as she added, ""They're coming!""
""Who?"" asked Ithamar in alarm as he saw what looked like soldiers approaching through an open doorway just ahead of them.
""They're coming! They're coming!"" repeated Ayla hysterically as she tried to get away from him but he pulled her back against him so that she was forced to walk beside him instead of turning around to run away. She looked at him with a frightened expression on her face as she demanded, ""What are they?""
""I don't know,"" said Ithamar, trying not to look back at them until he heard them speaking Orëska Aramaic which told him that they were soldiers of some kind. He thought about trying to kill them if things got really bad but didn't see any other option if this was going to work so he just tightened his grip on Ayla's hand and followed behind them while keeping an eye on them in case they decided to attack them from behind or turn around suddenly while they were still looking forward or ahead of them. They walked down another corridor for several minutes before reaching yet another door which stood open for them to walk through into a large room filled with tables and chairs where several people were sitting around eating their meals while talking among themselves or watching an old man who sat in a chair in front of them playing a harp that he held between his knees while singing an old song about someone who had died a long time ago. The song made Ayla look away from Ithamar as if she were ashamed for listening to it while walking through this room full of people who were eating and talking together so that she couldn't help hearing what they were saying about her and about what had happened to them both in their lives before they had met each other only a few days ago on the road leading into this valley.
After they left the dining hall through yet another open doorway, they were walking down another corridor when Ayla stopped walking again because she could hear voices coming from behind them coming from another room ahead of them which held several people sitting around several tables talking among themselves while eating their meals or watching two young women who were talking while walking toward them down another corridor while holding hands with one another in front of them.",1318,-0.03815140772236007,1.254369410637621,-0.0464634969994426,-0.635611286266637,-0.22744445945602887
131,R_szKKDDSiXeJvrd7,LOW_HOR_6,Horror,Low Rider,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had an old man's face with wrinkles all around its eyes, which were covered by long, thin eyebrows. It also had a big nose that stuck out from underneath its chin.
""You're awake,"" the man said in a deep voice. ""My name is William. My daughter and I found you last night.""
The man had been sitting down when he spoke to me but now stood up. He held his hand out for me to shake. His fingers were very thick, like tree roots wrapped around a large boulder.
""It's nice to meet you,"" I said as I shook his hand. ""What happened last night?""
William took a few steps closer to me and reached his hand through the mirror. ""You were attacked by vampires after coming out of the forest. We found you near death. You're lucky we were able to find you before they did.""
I put my hand through the mirror and felt myself getting smaller inside it. Once I had gone through, I saw that I wasn't alone. There were many other people standing around me, staring at me in awe. All of them looked just like William or his daughter, Elizabeth. They were all tall like him, with their long white hair tied back with black ribbons. They also had long noses and wrinkled faces, just like him.
""You must be tired,"" William said as he led me away from everyone else. ""Follow me and we'll get you something to eat. The food here is very good.""
I followed William to a table where two others already sat waiting for us. As we sat down, the man beside me introduced himself.
""I'm James,"" he said. ""Are you okay? You look terrible. You're pale and your lips are blue.""
I nodded. ""How am I feeling?"" I asked.
""You're weak, but you should recover soon.""
We ate our meal silently while James stared at me. After finishing off everything on my plate, I thanked everyone and left the dining room. When I went upstairs to my bedroom, there was another person standing in front of it. She was dressed in black pants and a red sweater. Her dark brown hair was pulled back into a ponytail.
""Elizabeth,"" William called to her as she stepped inside. ""This is Mary.""
Mary smiled at me. ""Hello, Mary.""
She didn't introduce herself to me so I figured that meant she knew who I was. We started talking about what happened to me. It turned out that we weren't the only ones here. There were several other young women living in the house too. One of them was pregnant and expecting a baby boy.
As I talked with Mary, William came up behind us and placed his hands on our shoulders.
""I want you both to meet someone,"" William said. ""This is my granddaughter, Alice.""
Alice smiled at us and walked over to the mirror. After stepping inside, I felt myself getting bigger and noticed the others shrinking around me. Alice had a very pretty face and a slender figure. Her black hair fell to her waist and was tied back with a white ribbon. When she stepped through, it made her appear much taller than I was.
William grabbed her shoulder and pulled her back out again. ""You have to stay out of mirrors,"" he told her sternly.
""Yes, grandpa. Sorry,"" Alice replied. ""I couldn't resist.""
After she left, I looked back at my reflection in the mirror and felt myself shrinking until I was the same height as Mary. ""Who are you?"" I asked her.
Mary looked surprised for a moment then laughed. ""You don't know? I'm Mary! You've seen me many times before, I bet.""
I stared at her. ""How do you know?""
Mary giggled and shook her head. ""Let's go sit down. We can talk more later.""
We went downstairs together and sat at another table. Mary told me that she was sixteen years old and that she lived here for a year before Elizabeth showed up.
""I wanted to run away from home. My parents don't really care about me anymore so it would be nice to live somewhere else.""
I looked up at Mary as she spoke. ""Why do you say they don't care?""
She shrugged. ""My mother has remarried recently. She's not interested in taking care of me anymore.""
I looked down at the table and frowned. I was glad to hear that Mary had a father who cared for her. I could tell she missed him by the sadness in her voice.
After lunch, William suggested I take a nap since I was still weak. I agreed because I felt completely exhausted. I fell asleep almost immediately once I lay down on my bed. While I slept, I dreamed about being chased by a dark shadow in a field. It was following me everywhere I went. Each time I tried to run away from it, it was always right behind me. It seemed to be laughing at me every time I tried to escape.
When I woke up, it was afternoon. I went downstairs and joined Mary and Elizabeth at the table again.
""Have you seen Mary yet?"" I asked Elizabeth.
Elizabeth shook her head. ""No, why? Is something wrong?""
""Just wondering.""
As I sat down next to Elizabeth, William walked into the dining room with Alice at his side. When they walked through the mirror, they appeared much smaller. ""Welcome to our family,"" William said to Alice. ""You seem very familiar to me.""
""That's because I've met you before,"" Alice said.
I gasped and stood up. ""You mean I have too? What are you doing here?""
""It's nice to meet you, Mary."" Alice said and shook my hand.
""Mary!"" I exclaimed and grabbed Mary's hand. ""Do you remember me?""
She looked surprised for a moment. ""Of course I do,"" she replied. ""I haven't forgotten about you after all this time.""
""What are you talking about?"" I asked.
""I've been watching you from afar these past couple months.""
I looked at Alice with wide eyes. ""Really?""
""Yes, you're one of my favorite people to watch.""
Everyone started looking at me funny and I realized that I must have looked insane. ""Wait a minute! Don't all of you remember me?""
Mary shook her head no and kept shaking it the whole time.
I looked at William and then Alice. Both of them were smiling at me, waiting for me to answer my own question.",1129,-1.629212763324284,-0.09406703956905461,0.9718578971306032,-1.091490683266464,-1.6951518895398618
132,R_2Vxu9C5ghrThqx1,OUR_HOR_4,Horror,Ouroboros,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was thin, long-nosed, and had sunken cheeks that almost disappeared under its gray skin. Its lips were pulled back in a wide smile and it held one hand out toward me as if beckoning me closer. As the other hand slowly traced its fingers down my cheek, I backed away, scared by what I saw reflected in the glass.
As I turned and ran for the door, the mirror began to shatter into thousands of tiny shards. I fell down on the floor and felt them slide under my skin like hundreds of tiny needles. In just seconds, they traveled down my body with all their little sharp ends reaching through the surface of my skin to the inner depths. I closed my eyes tight as the pain started to build, but as soon as the pain hit my mind, the glass began to move under my skin again. The shards began to crawl up my arms and legs toward my heart as I tried to scream but no sound would come out.
I could feel the glass crawling along my neck, finally making it up to my mouth and biting deep into my tongue. I was trying to pull it out but it kept growing larger and more painful. I opened my eyes wide so I wouldn't miss any of the pain as it reached its peak. I opened my mouth to cry out when it pierced my brain. I stopped screaming, I didn't have the strength to even close my mouth anymore. As it began to devour my brain, the pain finally came to an end. I opened my eyes to see myself in a bright light as I was slowly dying.
The sound of knocking came from behind me as a second face appeared in the mirror. I could tell it was an older woman by the wrinkles and gray hair. She had a thin smile on her lips as she waved one hand at me. When the other hand went through the glass, my body followed its motion. As the glass began to pull us apart, we looked into each other's eyes for a moment before it pulled away.
When the glass stopped moving, the world around me was quiet. It was as if time had stopped as well. I saw the gray skin man standing next to the old woman with both their hands reaching for me. They wanted me to come closer.
""Don't touch me!"" I screamed. ""Get your hands off of me!"" But they were already too late. Their skin pulled through the glass and grabbed me, pulling me into them. I tried to fight back, but they had me now.
As our mouths met, the gray skin began to fill my mouth and the old woman smiled. I felt as if my whole body was on fire as the glass started to melt in my mouth. My teeth broke off and slid down my throat, trying to escape. When they reached my stomach, I could feel the sharp edges begin to cut. I knew what this meant and began to beg for death as the world faded to black.
I woke up to find myself in bed. The clock told me that I had slept for almost four hours and it was now 6:00 p.m.. I jumped out of the bed, running to the mirror to check if I was still alive.
The glass had not returned and my reflection showed no sign of gray skin or anything else. It was just like the first time I'd looked into the mirror, except the light was off. I turned the switch on and the mirror glowed with a bright white light, making the room brighter than it should have been at night.
I ran out the door, scared and confused. When I got back to the house, the sun was coming down. I walked inside and took a quick shower. When I got out, I went over to my computer and looked at my email.
I was shocked to see a new one from my boss asking me to work late into the night because some documents had been misplaced. I decided to stay late since it was getting late anyway.
When I got back, I took another look around for any trace of the ghost that I had seen in the mirror. I couldn't find anything. After eating dinner, I lay down to try and get some sleep. Before I dozed off, I heard something like knocking on the glass and then felt a tug on my heart. I tried to open my eyes but they wouldn't move. Something had hold of me and wouldn't let me go. I could feel it's mouth on mine as it drew my soul through my tongue to devour it.
As I slowly died, I began to see a light appear in front of me. I opened my eyes wide so I wouldn't miss anything, but nothing appeared. I closed my eyes again, trying to wake myself up, but still I couldn't move. In my last moments, I saw the light and knew what it meant. The gray skin was now pulling me through my stomach and into the center of my brain.
In an instant, I was gone. I felt no pain. I simply woke up to find myself in the middle of a cornfield staring into the mirror. My reflection stared back at me with a wide smile on its face. It was wearing a suit and held a briefcase in one hand, tapping it against the glass. As it continued to tap it, I felt the tug of my heart as the gray skin began to pull it through my body. When it reached my throat, I opened my eyes wide in fear as I screamed.
The mirror shattered into millions of pieces, letting me fall on the ground. I began to scream for help, but the ghost kept pulling me into its mouth, waiting for my soul to be eaten. The sky began to turn black as night fell over the cornfields and the moon was just rising above the trees.
I looked up into the sky and saw a figure standing on top of the cornstalk, looking down at me. Its arms were stretched out in front of it. As I watched, it raised its hands above its head and pointed at me with a finger. The next moment, I was ripped away from the mirror, pulled through the glass, and then sent flying into the air. I hit the ground and rolled before stopping.
When I got to my feet, the cornfield around me was covered in blue flames as I turned around to look at where the man had appeared from. When I saw him, he was gone and so was everything else. I felt my heart as I stood up and slowly walked back to my car, not knowing what to do.
It was about two hours later when I heard knocking on my door. My wife answered it and there was a police officer standing with her.
""Can I come in?"" He asked.
She stepped aside and let him pass. When he closed the door, I could hear him walking toward the kitchen.
""Why did you lock your bedroom door this morning?"" The officer asked. ""And why didn't you answer us when we knocked?""
I started to explain, but she interrupted me. ""I told you, the door was locked.""",1302,-0.6857927041151284,-0.3429540336265194,0.03949838210400958,-1.32709435391817,-0.44852986030821446
133,R_3I0hq1BRXgTsygV,BAS_HOR_3,Horror,Basic Coherence,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my reflection; it was someone else's. The person had black hair that was cut short in an almost military style, and their skin was pale like mine but with a darker tone. They wore a white dress shirt and dark pants.
""Who are you?"" I asked them as they stared back at me through the mirror. ""What do you want?""
The figure didn't say anything. Instead, he just continued staring at me for what seemed like hours before finally turning away. He then began walking towards the door. I followed him and watched as he opened it. There were two other figures standing outside. One was tall and thin while the other was shorter and rounder. Both of them had long hair and wore similar clothes to the one who'd been inside the mirror.
""You're not supposed to be here,"" said the man with the black hair. His voice sounded familiar somehow.
""We know,"" answered the woman with the longer hair. She spoke with a heavy accent. ""That is why we came.""
""Why would you do that? You shouldn't have done this. We could've found another way.""
""It was our only option,"" replied the taller woman.
""Well, now we don't have any options left. What will we do now?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""We'll find a way to get rid of them,"" said the woman with the heavier accent.
""How?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""By killing them,"" she told him. ""Kill them all so no one can tell us apart.""
""But how?"" asked the man with the black hair.
""We'll figure something out,"" said the woman with the heavier accent. ""Just make sure you kill them all. That's the only way we can stay alive.""
""Yes, ma'am,"" said the man with the black hair.
He closed the door behind him and left. As soon as the door shut, I ran to the window and saw him walk down the stairs and head out of sight. Then I turned around and looked at the mirror. I knew I couldn't let them escape. If they did, then they'd go after everyone else. I had to stop them before they could hurt anyone else.
I grabbed my knife from my nightstand and headed back to the mirror. This time when I entered, I didn't see anything except darkness. I reached out with my hand and felt nothing. I tried to turn on the light switch next to the mirror but it wouldn't work. I was trapped in the mirror with nowhere to run.
I started to panic but then I remembered the power button on my phone. I pulled it out of my pocket and pressed it. The screen lit up and I quickly typed in the number for 911. A few seconds later, I heard sirens outside. I waited until the police arrived and then stepped out of the mirror.
When the police officers entered the room, they immediately noticed the broken mirror and the blood splattered across the wall. They also saw the bodies lying on the floor. After taking pictures of everything, they took me to a cell where I stayed for three days. During that time, I was questioned by several detectives but none of them ever figured out who I really was or what happened.
After those three days, I was released without being charged with anything. My parents were relieved to see me home safe. However, I still had no idea who I was or how I got there. I decided to return to school because I needed to figure things out.
As I walked to my locker, I bumped into someone. I looked up and saw the girl from the mirror. Her face was covered by her hands. When she removed them, I realized it was her.
""Hi,"" she said.
""Hello,"" I replied.
She smiled and held out her hand. ""My name is Marie.""
""Nice to meet you, Marie,"" I said as I shook her hand. ""I'm Jason.""
""So, you're the one who broke the mirror,"" she said.
""Yeah,"" I responded.
""And you killed the people who were trying to take me away,"" she added.
""Yes, I did,"" I told her.
""Thank you,"" she said. ""You saved my life.""
""No problem,"" I replied.
Marie then looked down at her feet and said, ""I need your help.""
""With what?"" I asked.
""To save the world,"" she explained.
""Save the world?"" I repeated.
""Yes, Jason,"" she said. ""This is the last time I'm going to ask you. Please help me.""
""Okay, I'll try,"" I told her.
""Thank you,"" she said.
""Let's start by finding out who you are,"" I suggested.
""All right,"" she agreed.
We went to the library and spent the rest of the day researching. We read about the history of the mirror and the people who used it. The more we learned, the more confused we became. None of it made sense.
""We should probably talk to someone who knows about these mirrors,"" I said.
""Like who?"" asked Marie.
""Maybe the professor,"" I suggested.
""Professor Jones?"" she asked.
""That's the one,"" I confirmed.
""Do you think he'll believe us?"" she wondered.
""Probably not,"" I admitted. ""But we have to try. Besides, maybe he can tell us who you really are.""
""Okay,"" she said.
We went to his office and knocked on the door. He opened it and looked surprised to see us.
""Jason, what a surprise,"" he said. ""Is everything okay?""
""We wanted to ask you some questions,"" I said.
""Of course,"" he replied. ""Come in and sit down. I'll get us some coffee.""
We sat down and he handed us each a cup of coffee.
""So, what can I do for you today?"" he asked.
""We were wondering if you could tell us anything about the mirror,"" I explained.
""Oh, yes,"" he said. ""I remember it well. It was quite the mystery back in the day. The first person who discovered it was a young girl named Mary. She was living alone in the forest when she came across the mirror. She was very curious so she tried using it. To her amazement, it worked.",1078,-1.0315841675773334,-0.3024018012814829,0.8965289851704289,0.40416205307783026,-1.0124570239041968
134,R_1oFJLBQTAmLPI7g,ALL_HR_3,Historical Romance,All-Nighter,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her long blonde hair was braided in intricate patterns and fell around her shoulders. The light from the candles on the table cast shadows against her pale skin, but even then, he could see that she was beautiful.
He'd been so busy staring at her that he hadn't noticed that another man had also noticed her. The man stood up, reached for the girl's hand and pulled her out of her chair.
""Go,"" he said to the young woman with a look of disgust. ""Go before I tell the owner to throw you out.""
She didn't need telling twice. She ran out of the tavern like a frightened child, leaving the other man sitting alone at the table.
He'd felt so angry that he wanted to get up and go after the man who had touched her, but he couldn't move. He just sat there staring after her until the other man left. When he got back to work later on that evening, he told everyone what had happened. Everyone agreed that he should do something about it. They were all men, and they knew how much he hated the idea of anyone touching a woman without her consent.
But he didn't know where to start looking. She might have gone home, or to one of the nearby brothels. But if he went to one of those places, he'd probably be beaten to within an inch of his life. That was what would happen if he went to any of the other taverns in the town, where men like him drank too much and thought with their dicks rather than their brains.
So he spent most of the night walking the streets, hoping that he would see her again, or at least some trace of her. By dawn, he was exhausted and sore all over. He'd walked all around the town, but hadn't found a single thing.
The next morning, he went to the market square and looked around there, but she wasn't there either. The only place he could think to look now was the church, and that's where he headed. He had no idea what he would say when he got there. All he knew was that he couldn't let the man who had hurt her walk free.
It took him almost half an hour to walk there, but when he finally got to the small church, he felt as though he had been walking for days. There were no windows, so it was dark inside. A single candle was lit in one corner of the room, but even its light barely penetrated the shadows. It was like walking through a tunnel, with just enough light to make out the path ahead of him.
He stood in the doorway, taking in the scene before him. A large wooden cross hung on the wall behind the altar. In front of him were rows of pews, which were filled with people. Men and women sat quietly, some praying, others looking straight ahead, while a few looked up at the ceiling. He was the only one standing, his eyes fixed on the cross.
A woman appeared from the shadows, a candle in her hand. ""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""but this is a private service. We're not allowed to allow anyone in.""
He turned to face her. ""You don't understand. I want to see if someone has been hurt here.""
""No one here has been hurt, and we can't help you anyway,"" she replied.
""But they have. She came into the tavern and I saw the man who did it. He left without paying for his drink. When she tried to leave, he pulled her back and grabbed at her. If you go up to the church and open the door, I know it will be there.""
She looked at him closely. ""You've been drinking. That's not very clever. You'll end up getting hurt if you go anywhere near that church. And I'm not going to let you in anyway, so there's no point in arguing.""
He stepped forward and reached out for her. ""Please. I won't ask again.""
The woman held up her hand to stop him. ""I don't think so. This isn't your fight. Go away, before I call the police.""
He grabbed hold of her wrist and pulled her towards him. ""Don't tell me what to do.""
He was too drunk to remember anything about it afterwards, but he remembered feeling angry, and then suddenly, everything went black.
When he woke up, he felt like he had been hit by a truck. He lay there for what seemed like an eternity, trying to remember where he was, but nothing would come. Finally, he got up and staggered across to the altar, where he looked down at the cross.
His eyes followed the path of the wooden beam to its base. The nails were still in place, and he could feel them digging into his hands as he moved closer to the cross. There was blood on some of them, but he couldn't see any sign of what had caused it.
He sat down in one of the pews and watched the people praying. Most of them were dressed in their Sunday best, but there were a few who were obviously drunk or high on drugs. They just stared ahead with vacant looks in their eyes.
It took him a while to realise why he was there. It wasn't because of the girl he'd seen that night, but because of something else. When he'd first started coming to the tavern, the men had always given him a hard time. Some of them would make fun of him because of the way he spoke, and others would take great delight in seeing him fall over. They didn't care if he was hurt; all they cared about was making him feel small.
He hated those people, and he wished that he could kill every one of them. He wanted to tear out their throats and rip out their hearts, just like he'd seen done in one of the movies. But he knew that he couldn't do that, even though it made him feel better sometimes. He was a man, not a monster.
So he left the church, went back to the tavern and drank himself to sleep.
The next morning, he woke up feeling more refreshed than he had for months. He felt as if he could face the world again, and that's exactly what he did.
He walked through the market square, heading towards the other taverns. He wasn't going there to start trouble; he just wanted to get some answers. As he passed each of them, he spoke to the owners, asking them if they had ever seen the girl he'd mentioned. But they all denied it. They told him she must have been lying.
By mid-afternoon, he had no more leads, so he went back to the church. He sat down in front of the altar once again, looking at the cross.
He looked up to see a woman standing in the doorway. She was holding a candle in her hand. ""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""but we can't let you in here.""",1239,-0.03684003860942252,-1.4450985850269535,0.6225642660769859,-1.1012418669946493,-0.9682665095486637
135,R_7NUBGH3jiFIjvNf,GEN_HF_5,High Fantasy,Genesis,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It's an idyllic place,"" said Rufra. ""A perfect place for us to meet."" He waved his hand at the water. ""Can't you just feel that calmness?""
""I can see why they chose this spot,"" said Laith.
Rufra had decided to show them the way himself. He was pleased they were so willing to follow him and hoped he would not regret it later. He could have used one of his men, but if he did, they might ask questions about where he'd been. If he stayed ahead of them, then no one need know what had happened since he last saw them.
He walked down to the edge of the water, looking back at his warriors as they followed. They looked eager now, faces alight with excitement. Maybe it was because of what they'd seen in the hills outside the city, maybe it was because of Rufra himself. Either way, there was little doubt that they believed they were going to win this war.
""What do you think they'll be like?"" said Jula.
Laith made a face. ""I don't know. I've never met people who live in such a place. It seems almost magical.""
""We won't judge them by their surroundings,"" said Rufra. ""They will still be people, just like us. We are all the same under our skins. What we choose to reveal is another story.""
Jula nodded her agreement. She turned away and watched the villagers, hoping she could get a glimpse of the women who lived there.
""Do you really think the king will listen to us?"" said Laith.
Rufra smiled. ""Who knows? But he has to make decisions based on facts, not just stories told by people who want something. Will you tell me the truth about what happened to the man you killed?""
Laith shrugged. ""He was going to kill me. He tried first but missed. Then he went for my friends. I'm sorry, but it wasn't your fault. You couldn't have known. And even if you had seen it coming, how would you have stopped him? I wouldn't have.""
Rufra looked at him, trying to work out if Laith was telling the truth or whether he was hiding something. In the end, he decided it didn't matter. If his plan worked, he would soon enough be dead anyway.
""There's nothing we can do about it now,"" he said. ""Let's talk about other things. Did you catch anything last night?""
""Yes, thank you,"" said Laith and pointed to the fish laid out on the ground between them.
""I thought you only caught a few?""
""No, I caught more than that. There's no point giving you them though. You're too big. Besides, I ate them all myself. I am a growing boy after all.""
""You certainly look it,"" said Rufra, but he didn't say anything else. He felt uncomfortable asking Laith about his hunting prowess, but he needed the information.
Laith went on to explain how he'd used a spear to snare birds in flight, then caught fish with his hands. He'd also found a herd of sheep and, once he was sure they were alone, he'd run among them, knocking them over and trampling them until he'd killed several.
""So, I think we should go to the river and see what we can find there,"" said Rufra, glancing up at the towers above the village. He knew they had to meet King Lebannen at some point, but he couldn't see any obvious place to stand and wait. ""If the king doesn't come down to meet us, then we can try to sneak inside the tower. That will give us time to plan how to deal with him.""
""How does sneaking in sound to you?"" said Laith.
Rufra grinned. ""Come on then, let's go.""
Laith picked up the basket of fish and put it on top of the pack he was carrying.
Rufra glanced back at his warriors, and they moved quickly to form a line. They were a strange-looking group; tall for men, broad around the shoulders, well muscled arms, but short legs. Some had long hair tied back in a ponytail while others wore their hair loose. Their clothes were varied, some brightly coloured, others plain browns and greens.
When they reached the riverbank, Rufra stopped and stared at the water.
""Why are we stopping?"" said Laith. ""I thought we were going to steal something.""
""I thought we might,"" said Rufra, ""but I've changed my mind. I need to think.""
Laith looked at him curiously. ""About what?""
Rufra turned to him. ""If I'm going to die, then I want to take the best things with me, the ones that mean the most to me. First, I want these."" He picked up the bow, strung it, and then handed it to Laith. ""Then I want to take this."" He held out the sword. ""And finally, this."" He pulled the dagger from his belt. ""For me, those are the important things.""
Laith took the bow and the sword, and carried them both on his shoulder. The dagger Rufra slipped into his own belt.
""I know it's not very wise to carry weapons when we're meeting royalty,"" said Rufra. ""But I don't intend to surrender them.""
Laith laughed. ""Maybe you should tell the king that before he kills you. Perhaps you can trick him into thinking you're an ally. You know, 'Your Majesty' and all that. You can even offer him friendship and peace, although I doubt he'll believe you.""
Rufra shook his head. ""I don't want to fool him. I want to scare him. When he sees that I have friends, and that they mean him harm, he will come down to meet us. We'll make our plans then.""
Laith opened his mouth to speak again but Rufra placed a finger to his lips.
""Now, let's go.""
Rufra led them to the edge of the water. He was tempted to jump in, but he knew he'd never reach the other bank. Instead, he stepped onto a rock and looked into the water.
""Have you ever seen anything like this?"" he asked.
Laith shrugged. ""No. Is it safe to walk on the rocks?""
""Yes,"" said Rufra, ""it is. Don't worry. Do you know which direction we should go?""",1115,1.226902060831395,-0.04087110464550645,-0.6053529994997501,1.5974197712803733,0.09260422518759366
136,R_tMTXR3CEF03Tha9,ACE_HR_5,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He could feel his cheeks redden with embarrassment as he tried to hide himself behind a newspaper, but she had seen him, and she looked directly at him with an expression that said she knew exactly who he was. It was almost more than he could bear, having someone else know what he was doing, and so he rose from his chair and walked away without saying anything. But he couldn't help looking back over his shoulder to see if she would follow him. And she did.
He never went near the bar again after that day—he couldn't bear it if he ran into her there. The only way he could be sure not to run into her was by going home every night early and staying up late reading books on history, which wasn't all that exciting for him anyway. So when she came into the shop he owned, he hid behind a bookcase, pretending to read. When she left, he pretended he didn't know who she was, even though everyone in the town knew. That made things easier, since no one would bother him then.
It's funny how you can get used to something, especially when it's the thing you want most. After a while, seeing her around the town became normal enough that he stopped thinking about her as much. Until one evening when he was walking home through the woods and he heard her voice calling out to him from somewhere nearby. ""William!"" she cried out.
He turned to look at her and found her standing just beyond the trees, smiling at him. He smiled back, relieved to find her alive. But when she reached out to touch his cheek, he felt something sharp beneath her fingertips. He flinched involuntarily, pulling away from her touch, but she took hold of his hand instead and pulled him closer until their bodies were pressed together. He could feel her warmth against his own and wondered if this meant they were friends now. Then she kissed him, hard, and he realized they weren't. They weren't anything except strangers who happened to live in the same place.
""I have to go,"" she told him. ""But I'll see you tomorrow.""
And she disappeared before he could ask her why.
That was two weeks ago, and he hadn't seen her since then. Every day, he would walk down to the river and look for her, but each time she was nowhere to be found. Sometimes, he thought he caught a glimpse of her reflection in the water, but always when he moved towards it, she disappeared. He kept hoping she might show up, or that maybe she had gone somewhere else. But today he decided he wouldn't wait anymore. Today he was going to talk to her.
As William stepped onto the path that led to the river, he felt a chill fall over him. He shivered and glanced around, trying to figure out what was wrong, but the sun shone brightly overhead and there wasn't any wind blowing. Wasn't there? Something was different...
Ahead, he saw her sitting on the ground beside the river, staring into the water, her head bent low, as if she were listening to the sound of its flow. For some reason, she seemed to be crying. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking on his part. He couldn't tell whether she was male or female, although he suspected she must be female because he knew he was a man. Maybe he was mistaken about that too, since he couldn't really see very well. All he could make out was a dark outline, like a shadow. He stood still, watching her, wondering what she was doing there and why she was crying. As he watched her, he began to wonder if perhaps he should leave.
Maybe he shouldn't have come here after all. If she wanted to be alone, maybe he should let her be alone. But he was curious, so he started toward her, intending to say hello. He didn't intend to startle her, but he certainly hoped she didn't mind that he was approaching. Perhaps she'd be glad to see someone else.
When he got close enough, he saw that she had her hands buried deep inside the pocket of her skirt. Her head was bowed, and her shoulders shook slightly as she sobbed quietly to herself.
He frowned, feeling sorry for her. He wondered if he should call out to her, or maybe offer to give her a hug, but she looked so sad, so lost, he hesitated to do either of those things. Instead, he sat down next to her, resting his arm along the back of her seat. His hand closed around hers, and she jerked away, turning her face away.
She sniffed loudly and wiped her eyes with her sleeve, smearing mud across her cheeks. When she spoke, her words were muffled by her lips, making them sound like slurred whispers. ""What are you doing?""
He frowned, puzzled. What was he supposed to do? ""Doing what?"" he asked. ""Why did you cry?""
Her reply surprised him. ""You don't understand."" She sounded angry, hurt, bitter. ""My mother died last week.""
His heart went out to her. How terrible! ""Oh,"" he said softly. ""How did she die?""
""The plague,"" she replied. ""They think she probably picked it up from the rats that infest the sewers under the city. It's spreading fast, and there's nothing we can do to stop it.""
He nodded sympathetically. ""Yes, that does seem bad.""
She looked up at him, and for a moment he thought he saw something familiar in her eyes, like recognition, but then she turned away and stared off into the distance once more.
""Did you ever lose someone?"" he asked. ""Someone you loved?""
She didn't answer right away, but after a few moments she said, ""No. No one I've ever loved has died.""
He wished he knew what to say, how to comfort her, but he didn't. There was nothing he could possibly say that would ease her pain, and so he simply waited for her to finish. When she finally did, he tried to put himself in her shoes and imagine what he would feel like if he were in her situation. He thought about how he would feel if he'd been the one who had lost someone. He imagined that he would be devastated, that he would want to scream and shout and rage against the unfairness of it all. And that's exactly what she did.
She screamed and shouted and ranted and raved, and William tried to calm her, to reassure her, to explain that there was nothing anyone could do. But he knew he was only saying the same thing over again, and that it didn't matter, not to her. Not to anyone. And he knew that he couldn't help her, that there was no way for him to ease her suffering, even though he wished desperately that there was.
Finally, she fell silent and lay back against the ground. She pulled her knees up against her chest and wrapped her arms around them. ""It doesn't matter,"" she murmured, as if talking to herself. ""I'm not important. I never was.""
""Who said that?"" he asked gently.
""I did.""
He shook his head in disbelief. ""Why would you say such a thing?""",1266,-0.45528683589176483,0.9686598109783292,0.29568226675604575,0.7838294657611481,0.0823216810095079
138,R_2Ym31miLlC1pebC,ACE_HOR_6,Horror,Ace of Spade,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was an old woman's face with deep wrinkles all around her eyes and mouth. Her skin was white and she had gray hair that stuck straight up in the air like she'd been electrocuted. She didn't have any eyebrows or eyelashes. I backed away slowly so as not to scare her. The sound of knocking came again. This time, when I turned my head to look for the source, there were two more faces in the mirror, each one older than the last. They were staring right through me, trying to get closer. I started to shake as I realized they weren't just people; these were ghosts!
""Please don't hurt me,"" I begged them, ""please go away."" But the ghostly figures kept coming closer and closer, their faces getting larger and larger until they were right in front of me. They pushed against my chest. I could feel them pushing down, trying to force themselves inside me. Their hands reached under my arms and pulled me forward. There was nothing I could do except let them pull me towards the mirror. As we got close enough to see each other, the three ghosts began talking to each other in whispers. One of them spoke louder than the others. ""You can't stop us!"" he said. ""We're already here!"" He laughed at his own joke then pushed himself deeper inside of me. I screamed as loud as I possibly could but no one came running. No one heard me scream because no one else was home. The ghost pushed harder and faster now. I tried to run but couldn't move fast enough before he caught me. My feet were moving, but I wasn't making any progress. Soon, he was pulling me along by my neck and I could tell I would be dead soon if something didn't happen quickly. Then I felt myself being lifted off the ground, carried like a rag doll to the mirror. Before I knew what happened, I was standing in the mirror, looking back at the ghosts. They grabbed my legs and held me up while the man who'd spoken to me earlier went behind me and shoved his fingers inside my body. He wiggled them around like he was feeling around for something. His hand finally found something, and he yanked hard. Out popped a small object and he threw it onto the floor. It rolled across the floor, stopping about ten feet away from where I stood. A smile spread across the ghost's face as he pointed at the object and made a noise. It sounded like the noise you make when someone says your name and you turn around to find them standing behind you. I knew this was bad news. I knew exactly what it meant. These ghosts were going to kill me! I wanted to cry, but I had no tears left.
The ghost picked up the object and showed it to me. It was a large ring. It looked expensive. He put it on his finger, turning it to show me how shiny and pretty it was. Then he took another ring out of his pocket and placed it next to it. They both shone in the light from the street lamp outside. The first ghost turned back to me. ""This is why we're here,"" he said, ""and this is why you will die."" He raised his hand above my head, and I braced myself for the worst. Instead, he slammed his fist down on top of my head, causing me to fall to the floor. He picked me up off the floor and set me down on the chair. Then he told the other two ghosts to leave. The two ghosts disappeared and the man turned back to me. ""Now,"" he said, ""you must give us everything you have.""
""No way am I giving you anything,"" I replied. ""Get out of my house and take those rings with you. If you don't want to do that, then I'm afraid I'll have to call the police.""
He smiled and shook his head. ""Oh, dearie, you won't need to do that."" He opened a drawer in the dresser beside him. He pulled out a gun and aimed it directly at my forehead.
""If I have to shoot you,"" he continued, ""then so be it. You may not be able to escape me."" He pressed the trigger, but the gun wouldn't fire. The ghost gave me a wicked grin and shrugged his shoulders. ""What a shame,"" he said, ""but I guess I should have known better than to think you would actually give us anything. After all, we are the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future."" With that, he waved his hand and I fell unconscious.
When I woke up, I was lying on my couch with the blanket covering my head. I sat up and saw the man sitting in the same place as he'd been when I fell asleep. He had the gun in his lap and he was holding the ring in his hand. He glanced at me, then at the ring, then back to me again. I pretended to sleep. I waited for him to make some kind of move.
""Do you know who I am?"" he asked.
I nodded. ""Of course. That's why I'm here to kill you.""
""Don't be foolish,"" he said. ""Why would you want to kill me? What does it matter to you anyway? You're a ghost, aren't you?""
""Yes,"" I admitted, ""I am, and I want to kill you very badly.""
""That's good,"" he said, ""because I want to kill you, too.""
""Well,"" I said, ""if you're the ghost of Christmas future, then I hope you don't mind me killing you.""
""Actually,"" he said, ""that's one thing I don't mind. In fact, I welcome death.""
""Good,"" I said. ""Then maybe I'll just wait for you to kill yourself. Then I'll be rid of both of you.""
""I don't plan to kill myself,"" he said, ""not unless you force me to.""
""How did you get into my house, anyway?""
""It doesn't really matter,"" he answered. ""All that matters is that I've been sent to collect your soul.""
""You mean to say you're a demon?""
""I suppose that's what I am,"" he answered, ""though I prefer the term ghost.""
""Well,"" I said, ""don't worry. I don't have any intention of handing my soul over to you.""
""That's the spirit,"" he said. ""But I don't think you realize how serious things are. The last time I visited you, I came to warn you about the evil spirits and demons you were inviting into your life. This time, I'm here to deliver the final warning.""
""So, what is the final warning?"" I asked.
""The only reason you're still alive,"" he explained, ""is because the spirits haven't decided yet whether or not they want to claim your soul."" He paused and I thought for sure he was going to continue, but he didn't.",1215,-0.07236210149322304,-0.5623582843392823,0.5168774095991422,0.7156862355567585,-0.9499759681071113
139,R_qQNwiEqEJIdaKad,MOR_HR_9,Historical Romance,Morpho,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The tavern was almost empty, with only a few patrons scattered around the room. She was a young, pretty thing, perhaps nineteen or twenty years old. She wore a plain brown skirt and a white blouse with a blue ribbon at her neck. A small purse hung from her shoulder. He could see that she had auburn hair and green eyes.
She was young, but she was beautiful, and he knew at once that he would love her. He didn't say anything to the young man who brought him his ale, but he had been watching her for a while, and he knew that she didn't belong there. He watched her for a while longer, thinking about what he would do when the tavern closed and she left. As it turned out, she was the only person to remain in the tavern after everyone else had left. He watched her closely as she drank her ale. He was fascinated by the way she moved. She looked so delicate, so graceful. He could see her clearly even though the room was dark and his eyesight was poor.
He wondered how she could possibly be there by herself. She didn't fit the tavern's usual clientele; no one like her came there. No one like her ever had. He tried to imagine how it could be that she had ended up in the tavern of all places. It just didn't make sense.
He thought about asking her about herself, but decided against it. He had never been very good at conversation, and he wasn't sure that he would have been able to carry on a conversation with her anyway. He was too shy, too awkward, and he didn't have the proper words to use in conversation. All he could think of to say was that she seemed so unusual for someone who had ended up in the tavern.
He knew that if he were to say that to her, she might just laugh at him, although he wasn't sure what kind of a reaction he would get from her if she actually did laugh at him. He would probably be embarrassed at having spoken to her at all, which would probably make him even more awkward than before. But he had to say something to her; he couldn't just let such a lovely woman sit there by herself any longer than he had already let her sit there for. Besides, it was almost time for him to close the tavern for the night, and if she were still sitting there when he closed up shop, he would be forced to stay open longer than usual in order to keep an eye on her. He really didn't think that would be good for business, and he didn't feel right about doing that anyway.
The young woman drank her ale quietly for a while longer. Then she stood up and went outside into the cold evening air. As soon as she stepped outside, she paused and looked around the street. Then she quickly went back inside the tavern and disappeared into one of the back rooms. The young man came back with another ale; the man waved him off before he could pour it down the young man's throat, which was almost empty anyway. Then the man picked up a wooden bowl and went over to a box on one of the tables where the young woman had been sitting earlier in the day. He took some coins from her purse and placed them into the box, then picked up the box and carried it back into his room at the back of the tavern.
The man watched as the young woman stood up and approached him again. She looked frightened; he could see that clearly now that he could see her face clearly in the light from the windows. She looked frightened because he was a stranger to her; she didn't know who he was or where he had come from. She probably thought that he was going to hurt her somehow or do something bad to her. She probably thought that she ought to run away from him right then and there and get away from him as quickly as possible. But she didn't run away; instead, she came closer to him for some reason.
""I'm sorry I scared you,"" he said gently to her as soon as she came close enough for him to see her face clearly without having to squint at her because of what little light there was in the tavern that night. ""I'm afraid I startled you when you came out of your room earlier today.""
The young woman looked up at him curiously, as if she had never seen him before in her life or maybe not even known that he existed before that moment that he had spoken to her inside the tavern earlier in the day. ""It's all right,"" she said softly as she sat down again at one of the tables near him. ""I guess I haven't been spending enough time at home lately.""
""Where are you from?"" asked the young man cautiously as soon as she seated herself once more at the table in front of him. He realized that perhaps his tone sounded too abrupt for his liking but decided not to worry about it right then because it wasn't like it was really his fault anyway, considering how strange he'd felt when she had come out of nowhere earlier in the day and scared him half out of his wits. ""I've never seen you before.""
The young woman shook her head gently again as if she were trying to shake off an unpleasant memory from somewhere deep inside of herself. She looked down at her hands as if they were suddenly completely unfamiliar objects to her. ""I can't remember,"" she said softly as tears filled her eyes once more as they usually did when she thought about where she had come from or who she had been before she'd arrived here in this world or wherever it was that they were now together in this strange place together together in this strange place together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situatio
""Are you sick?"" asked the young man gently as soon as he saw that tears were forming in the corners of her beautiful eyes once more because they usually did whenever she thought about where she'd come from or who it was that might have raised her or brought her here or brought her here or brought her here before this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature was a balmy seventy degrees Celsius.
""Hey, Dave!"" called Alex as he emerged from the building next door. He waved and waited for me to catch up. ""Did you get your new computer set up yet?"" Alex had just gotten back from Earth several months ago, where he'd been training to be a pilot for the Mars mission. His sister, Molly, was also coming along. We were going to be living together while we were waiting to go to Mars.
""Yeah, I've got it all hooked up now. How about you? Did they give you your new assignment?""
Alex shook his head. ""Nope, still no word. They haven't even started sending people down to train for that yet.""
""Well, since we're both stuck here until then, why don't we go out and do something?""
We walked over to the nearby park. There were plenty of trees around there, so the air would be nice and cool. I saw Alex's two friends, Michael and Kip, walking toward us.
""Hey guys! What are you doing today?"" asked Alex.
""Nothing much. Just hanging out,"" replied Michael, a tall, skinny guy who looked like he could be an athlete or a model.
""No kidding. You guys look bored. Want to come play some pickup basketball?"" I suggested.
Michael laughed. ""I can't believe you even know what that is.""
""Do I?"" I said. ""You should try it sometime. It's really fun.""
The four of us went ahead and played a few games. By the end of our time in the park, everyone was sweaty but happy. We decided to walk back to our respective apartments.
As we approached mine, I noticed a young man standing on my front stoop. He wore a white lab coat and held a clipboard in one hand.
""Morning!"" he said cheerfully. ""My name is Dr. Peter Aikens. I'm here from the National Institute of Health to check up on you. Would you mind if we came inside? I need to take your blood pressure and temperature, just to make sure everything's okay.""
""Sure, go right ahead,"" I answered.
Dr. Aiken stepped past me and opened the door. As soon as he did, I smelled an unpleasant odor coming from within. I followed him inside and closed the door behind me.
""Why don't you have a seat?"" I gestured to the couch. ""Would you like anything to drink?""
""Oh, I'm good thanks,"" said Dr. Aiken. ""But please, call me Pete. No one ever does.""
""Okay, Pete."" I nodded. ""Can I get you anything?""
""No, thank you. I'll be fine.""
""So, Pete, how long will this take?"" I asked.
""Just a few minutes. Don't worry, it won't hurt at all,"" he reassured me.
Pete sat himself down on the couch across from me. He pulled out a small device and pressed it against his ear. After a few seconds, he put it away and began writing down notes on his clipboard.
""You live alone, right?"" he asked. ""Is anyone else home?""
I hesitated. ""I guess my girlfriend is. She's upstairs.""
""That's okay. I'll only be gone for a minute or two. I want to make sure you're healthy enough to travel to Mars.""
""Oh, that's not necessary. I'm perfectly healthy.""
""Really?"" Pete tilted his head curiously. ""You don't look sick to me. Do you feel any different lately?""
""I'm sorry, Pete, but I really can't tell you that. I'm sure you understand.""
Pete sighed. ""Yes, I do. But I'm going to have to ask you to come with me, anyway. This is an official government matter.""
""I really don't think—""
""It's alright,"" he interrupted. ""It won't be for too long. I promise.""
""Alright, well, I'll be right back.""
I ran up the stairs and knocked on the bedroom door. ""Gina? Dr. Aiken is here.""
There wasn't a response. I tried again, louder this time. Still nothing. I let myself in the room and found Gina sprawled out on the bed.
""Gina?"" I knelt down beside her. ""Are you okay?""
She didn't respond. Her eyes were closed and she was breathing shallowly. I lifted her head and felt for her pulse. It was faint, but steady.
What am I supposed to do? I thought.
I quickly dialed 911 and told them what happened. They sent an ambulance and two police officers over immediately.
""This isn't looking good,"" said Detective Sergeant Crenshaw. ""Maybe you should go wait in the hallway.""
I nodded and left the room. When I returned, they'd taken Gina out of the house on a gurney. She hadn't woken up. I watched as they wheeled her out of the house and into the ambulance.
""Is she okay?"" I asked the officer. ""What happened?""
He shook his head sadly. ""Her vitals are pretty low. We've done CPR and given her fluids, but it looks like we may have lost her.""
""Who was she?"" I asked.
""Just a neighbor,"" he replied. ""She looked a little frail, but we never expected anything like this to happen.""
""I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?""
Detective Crenshaw shrugged. ""Not really. If you need to speak to the coroner, just let me know.""
After the ambulance drove off, I sat down on the curb and leaned my head against the side of my car. I felt numb. My eyes wandered aimlessly. I couldn't stop thinking about what had just happened. I knew I needed to follow up with the police later, but first I wanted to find out more information about what had happened to Gina.
I pulled out my phone and searched for news stories about sudden deaths. There were plenty of articles about people dying suddenly, sometimes without warning. I clicked on one of the links and read the story.
""A twenty-three year old woman named Gina Martin was found dead in her home earlier today. According to local authorities, Ms. Martin suffered from a rare genetic disease known as Marfan Syndrome.",1052,-1.6048091377915505,0.016932605773779707,1.5302536966698597,1.3543116790102285,0.9793570920123974
141,R_24O8Sq9rx3npho2,GEN_HF_2,High Fantasy,Genesis,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They circled around one tower before landing near the shoreline where they were met by three men wearing leather armor and carrying spears. Their faces were hidden behind steel masks that had been painted black.
""Welcome to my village,"" said the tallest man, his voice deep and rumbling. ""What do you want?""
""We seek your help.""
The tall man's eyes narrowed as he studied them. ""Why would I help you? You're strangers with no reputation among us.""
""Because we have something that belongs to you.""
All three warriors stiffened at this, the taller man stepping forward. ""Who are you?""
""I am called Zephyr,"" said Nia, lifting her chin proudly. She gave him a quick bow then turned to look at the other two. ""This is Ryn and Vaelin.""
Zephyr eyed them warily. ""And what do you have that belongs to me?""
Nia gave him an impish grin. ""A dragon egg.""
The warrior's eyes widened momentarily before narrowing again. ""You wouldn't dare… no, it must be true. How did you find it?"" He nodded at the basket hanging from Ryn's back.
Ryn shrugged. ""It fell down from the heavens.""
""As if there were such things,"" muttered the nearest warrior.
""I'm not joking,"" said Nia. ""There are dragons living in the mountains south of here. We found the egg washed up on the shore after a rainstorm and brought it here."" She paused to take a deep breath before continuing. ""We need your help retrieving it from the mountains.""
One of the warriors stepped forward, pointing a spear toward the sky. ""Come away now! This is no place for you!""
""Stay back!"" Nia shouted.
Her warning was too late as the tallest warrior leapt forward, swinging his spear at her. Nia's arm moved faster than anyone could follow, her fingers curling into a fist and snapping outwards, catching the spear-wielder across the face just below his mask. The impact sent the man stumbling backward, both hands grasping at his head, blood flowing freely from a split lip.
Another of the warriors recovered quickly and swung his spear at Nia again, this time aiming for her legs. She sidestepped easily though, her feet moving swiftly beneath her as she spun to meet the attack, her foot slamming into the warrior's groin before he could get his spear fully upright. His scream reverberated off the surrounding cliffs as he doubled over, clutching at his injured privates while Nia kicked him in the ribs and sent him collapsing to the ground.
She glanced at the third warrior, who had backed away from the scene and was staring at her with open disbelief. ""Are you okay?""
He nodded numbly. ""Yes, thank you.""
""Well, let's go then.""
The three of them hurried toward the village as fast as they dared without looking like they were trying to run. As they drew closer, Nia could see several more warriors standing in clusters around the buildings. None of them made any move to approach them but she still felt nervous. It was clear these men weren't going to give her the benefit of the doubt and she didn't blame them. Not after what had happened to the last person who tried to steal an egg from their village.
They entered the village and headed toward the largest building which appeared to be the only inn. Several villagers were gathered outside, talking quietly together. They stopped speaking when they saw the newcomers and watched silently as Nia and Ryn dragged the unconscious warrior inside the building. The other warriors approached the inn door cautiously, spears held ready, their faces hidden behind their masks.
The interior of the inn was dark and smoky, a fire pit burning brightly in the center of the room. Two tables had been pushed together at one end with a few stools placed around them. There were a handful of people seated at the tables, all watching the newcomers with suspicion. One man stood from his seat and walked over, holding a jug of wine and a cup. Nia recognized him as the innkeeper.
""What are you doing bringing trouble like this into our home?"" he asked. ""Take your friend and leave before I call the others.""
Ryn glared at him. ""Do you really think you'll be able to stop us?""
The man smiled grimly, placing the jug and cup on the table. ""Try me.""
""If you don't let us sit down and drink first, there won't be anything left for you to try.""
The innkeeper chuckled. ""Very well then, you can have whatever you wish.""
Ryn took a stool beside the table and gestured for Nia and Vaelin to join him. ""Thank you.""
""Don't mention it.""
""So, how did you find this place?"" asked Ryn, pouring himself some wine.
""It was mentioned by someone we encountered on the road.""
""How far are you from the mountains?""
""Not far. About two days' journey.""
""Good, because it seems the egg is about to hatch. We've seen signs of activity in the area.""
""Activity?""
""Dragons. Lots of them.""
Nia stared at him in surprise. ""You mean you're expecting a baby dragon?""
""That's right.""
The innkeeper placed a wooden platter on the table and brought over three steaming bowls of stew, setting them down before the travelers. ""Eat, eat. I'll bring another pot of stew later.""
Ryn thanked him and helped himself to some stew, helping himself to a second bowl after Nia finished hers. ""Tell me, how big is this egg?""
""It has yet to hatch so it's hard to say for sure. Judging from size and shape, I'd guess it will be somewhere between three and five meters long. That's pretty average for an egg from one of the larger species.""
""A dragon?"" asked Nia.
""No, not exactly. They're actually half human and half dragon. The offspring of a dragon and a human.""
""Where do they come from?""
""From eggs. Like the one you have with you.""
""I thought they hatched from live dragons?""
The innkeeper laughed. ""Sure, in stories. But the truth is that the eggs of most species are laid by the parents in caves or under rocks. When they're ready to hatch, the mother moves them to a safe place, often a cave or a nest high up in a tree. Then she leaves to hunt, leaving the father to fend for himself until the young emerge from their shells.""
""Fend for themselves?""
The innkeeper nodded. ""Most of the time it's just a matter of waiting.",1156,0.17332936086250264,-0.8766586709840484,0.030012829328827983,-0.4392932569590072,-0.17567157086739685
142,R_8BprwLWRIk0g0Vz,BAS_HOR_2,Horror,Basic Coherence,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a woman's face but with horns growing from her head. She had long black hair that went down to her waist and dark eyes. Her lips were full and she had a small nose. There was no color to her skin or any other distinguishing features except for the horns. They stood straight up above her forehead like an animal's would. As soon as I saw them, they started moving and grew longer and larger. The more they grew, the less human they became. I backed away from the mirror in fear when I felt something grab my ankle. I fell backwards onto the floor and screamed. My husband came running over to see what happened. He picked me up off the ground and asked if I was okay. I told him that someone grabbed my leg and tried to pull me under the water. He ran to get some help while I sat on the edge of our tub.
The next day we moved to another house. We didn't tell anyone about the incident because we both knew people would think we were crazy. That night I woke up screaming. I couldn't move and all I could do was watch myself sleep. I watched myself turn into a demon before my very eyes. I turned into a monster. I watched my body grow long arms and legs. Then I watched as my hands grew claws and sharp teeth appeared in my mouth. I looked at my husband sleeping beside me and smiled. I wanted to kill him so bad. I wanted to rip his heart out and eat it. But then I remembered how he saved me last time. I stopped smiling and began to cry. I cried until I passed out. The next morning I woke up and saw that I was still alive. I was relieved because I thought I killed myself in my dream. I went downstairs and found my husband sitting at the kitchen table. He told me that he saw me standing behind him in the kitchen. He said that I looked like a demon and he couldn't look at me without being afraid. I apologized for scaring him. After breakfast, I took a shower. While I was washing my hair, I noticed blood coming from underneath the sink. I opened the cabinet door and pulled out a knife. I cut my arm open and let the blood drip down the drain. I put the knife back where I found it and washed my wound. I cleaned the bathroom and made sure everything was in order before I went back to bed. I slept peacefully that night and didn't have any dreams. I figured that maybe I was just going crazy and needed to go see a doctor.
When I woke up the next morning, I went to take a shower and saw that the blood was gone. I was confused because I never used the bathroom sink to wash my wounds. I decided to clean it anyway and make sure nothing was wrong. I wiped down the sink and realized that there wasn't any blood on the towel. I was shocked because I had seen it with my own eyes. I called my husband and told him about it. He told me not to worry because it must be a coincidence. He said that he doesn't believe in anything supernatural and that I'm probably just imagining things. He said that I need to relax and stop worrying.
Later that night, I went to use the bathroom and saw that the blood was back. This time I didn't clean it off. I left it there and went to bed. The next morning, the blood was gone again. I was starting to get worried. I decided to call my mom and ask her if she had ever heard of this happening before. She told me that she has heard stories of people seeing demons in mirrors but she never believed them. She said that if you want to know what's real, you should try asking your grandmother. I thanked her and hung up. I got online and searched for information on demons in mirrors. I read all kinds of different articles. Some said that if you stare into a mirror long enough, you will become one. Others said that if you look into a mirror and don't blink, you'll die. One article even said that if you look into a mirror and smile, you'll have good luck. I laughed at that one. I decided to test it out and stared at the mirror for several minutes. Nothing happened. I blinked and went on with my life.
A few days later, I was taking a bath when I heard the sound of scratching on the wall. When I looked, there was a face staring back at me. It was a man's face but with horns growing from his head. His eyes were yellow and his mouth was filled with sharp teeth. I screamed and jumped out of the tub. My husband came running over to see what happened. He picked me up off the ground and asked if I was okay. I told him that someone was trying to scare me. He laughed and said that I was imagining things. He told me that I was too old to be scared by silly things like that. He said that I needed to get over it and stop acting like a child. He went back to watching TV and I went to bed.

143,R_Y5D2JqTzMe5h6bD,ALL_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
As I walked down the sidewalk toward the center of town, I pulled up the message on my wrist computer and started to read it. It was a short message, but it gave me pause. The president was requesting our presence? This had never happened before. He usually just sent a note.
When I arrived at the building where I'd been living for the past two years, I walked into the lobby and waited as a young woman in a white lab coat handed me a visitor badge. I checked in at the front desk, and then went down a long hallway lined with offices until I came to one marked ""President's Office."" I stepped inside, and there sat President Kuklo, waiting for me.
""You're early,"" he said with a smile as I stepped inside his office. ""We were hoping you would come."" He gestured for me to sit in the chair across from him, so I did.
""Thank you for inviting us to your office today,"" I said as I took off my helmet and placed it on the floor next to me. The room was cool, but not uncomfortably cold like some of the buildings back on Earth. The air recyclers were efficient here, and the atmosphere was breathable.
The president nodded and smiled again. ""Thank you for coming, Doctor,"" he replied. ""I know you have a busy schedule, so I'll keep this brief. As I'm sure you've heard, we are having trouble with the colony's food supply. We haven't had any luck growing crops, and the soil is too thin to grow much of anything. Our food supplies are running out, and I need to get our agricultural team working on finding a solution.""
I was shocked by this news. The president hadn't mentioned that he was having any issues with the food supply. If he did, I must have missed it. ""What's your current ration status?"" I asked, trying to sound calm.
""Our rations last about three months, and we've used up half of them already,"" he answered. ""That means that if things don't improve soon, we won't be able to provide for our people for much longer. This is why I wanted to talk to you. I need you to help us find a way to solve this problem.""
My mind started racing. ""I'm afraid I don't have the experience you need for this,"" I told him honestly. ""I'm not trained in agriculture. You should ask Dr. Sato to come down here to Mars.""
""I know she's a scientist,"" President Kuklo said. ""But her job is to research how life originated on Earth, not to find a solution to a problem like this. And she's already working on something else at the moment. That's why I thought you might be a better person for the task.""
""You think I can do this?"" I asked him.
""Yes,"" he said with a nod. ""I have complete confidence in you.""
""Well,"" I said with a smile. ""That makes me feel better."" I paused for a few seconds before continuing. ""But let me tell you what I would need if I were going to help you out with this problem.""
""Go ahead,"" he said as he leaned back in his chair.
""First off, you need to send someone down to Earth to get some help,"" I said. ""They need to bring back soil samples from different locations around the planet. Then they need to mix it together in the labs so we can see if any of it has the ability to grow.""
""And how long will that take?"" he asked.
""It depends,"" I told him. ""The soil sample will only tell you part of the story. We need to do tests to see what kind of plant it might grow into."" I paused and took a deep breath before continuing. ""You're going to need at least one year, maybe two or three, to figure this out.""
""Do you have any other suggestions?"" he asked, leaning forward again.
""Well, another thing you could do is get more people involved,"" I told him. ""Maybe some of your political rivals who aren't currently on the council. If you had enough people working on it, it might make progress faster.""
""You think that's a good idea?"" he asked.
""Sure, why not? It'll get them out of their offices and doing something useful for once,"" I said with a laugh.
""I like it,"" President Kuklo said with a smile. ""We can send a message to the other members of the council and ask them if they'd be interested in helping out. Once they hear about the food supply problem, they'll probably want to get involved.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""But you also need to let them know that it will take a lot longer than one or two months to find a solution.""
""I agree with you on that,"" he said. ""And we'll need to make sure they understand that we can't just start growing crops out here on Mars. The plants need sunlight, which we don't have much of here on the planet.""
""I'll talk to Dr. Sato,"" I said. ""She's already working on some things with plants that can grow without the sun.""
""Good,"" President Kuklo said with a nod. ""Let me know when you've talked to her, and I'll put the word out to the others."" He stood up from his chair and looked down at me. ""Now, I'm going to go tell our agricultural team about this so they can start planning their next move. You can call me back if you have any questions.""
As the president left his office, I took a deep breath and sat back in my seat. I didn't really know what to think about the whole thing. We were going to have to work on a solution to the food shortage, but I wasn't sure how I was supposed to help with it. All I knew was that I would do whatever it took to keep our colony alive and thriving.

144,R_3KNK9XYXKaGNpDK,BAS_HR_6,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been so busy that day with customers who wanted to talk about their problems and ask for advice that she hadn't caught his eye until it was too late. When he finally realized what she was doing, he couldn't help but stare. She wore an old-fashioned dress of black wool, cut low on her neckline and showing off a lot more cleavage than he liked. Her hair was long and loose, falling down over her shoulders as if it were made from spun gold. It was such a pretty shade of blonde, and it seemed to glow against the dark color of her dress. The way she held herself reminded him of a cat—her head up high, chin out, eyes narrowed in disdain. But there was something else about her that drew his attention. There was no mistaking it; she was beautiful. Even though he knew better, he could not take his eyes off her.
He watched her as she drank her ale and ate some bread and cheese. He kept stealing glances at her even when he wasn't looking directly at her. His gaze would wander back to her every few minutes, but she never noticed him. She didn't seem to notice anyone except the people she spoke to or the other men who came by to flirt with her.
After she finished eating, she got up and went outside to smoke a pipe. That's when he decided to try to speak to her. He approached her and asked if she needed any assistance. She turned around, startled, then smiled at him. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""You startled me.""
""It's all right,"" he replied. ""What can I do for you?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Are you new here? You don't look familiar.""
""No, I've lived here most of my life. What can I do for you?""
Her smile widened. ""Well, I just need someone to carry this stuff to my room for me."" She handed him a large bag filled with clothes and shoes.
He took the bag and followed her upstairs. As they walked along, he tried to think of something clever to say to get her attention again. Finally, he blurted out, ""Do you know what happened to the king's daughter?""
She stopped walking and stared at him. ""Excuse me?""
""The princess. Do you know why she ran away?""
""Why should I care?"" she asked. ""I haven't seen her since she left home.""
""That's because she is dead,"" he said.
""Dead? How did she die?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Everyone says she died in childbirth, but I heard that she was murdered. Someone killed her baby and then stabbed her.""
""Oh, dear,"" she said. ""Did she have a husband?""
""Yes, but I don't think he knows anything about it yet. They're still searching for her body. If they find it, then he'll be notified.""
""Where will they search?""
""They won't tell us. All we know is that they are going to search everywhere.""
""So, how do you know she's dead?"" she asked.
""Because she was supposed to marry Prince Arvin, but now he has no wife. So, everyone thinks that the prince must have done it. And if he did, then he would want to hide the evidence so no one would ever suspect him.""
""But who could kill the princess without being caught?"" she asked.
He shrugged. ""Maybe someone who knew her very well. Maybe someone she trusted.""
""And why would she trust them?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Because they loved her, maybe.""
""How do you know she was pregnant?""
""Because her maid told me. She said she was carrying twins.""
""Twins?"" she repeated. ""Really? Why would she have two babies?""
""I don't know. Maybe she already had one child and wanted another.""
She shook her head. ""I don't understand women. I only know about men. Men always want to make more children, especially after they get married. Women usually don't want to.""
""Well, I guess that makes sense,"" he said.
""Does it really? I mean, I've never thought about it before.""
He nodded. ""I suppose it does.""
When they reached her door, he set the bag down and helped her take off her coat. Then she opened her trunk and pulled out several dresses.
""Can you put these in my room for me?"" she asked.
He picked up the bag and carried it inside while she changed. When she was ready to go downstairs, she thanked him and gave him a small coin.
""Thank you for your help,"" she said.
As he left, he wondered whether she would ever see him again. He hoped she would, but he wasn't sure. He wished he had spoken to her earlier, but he couldn't change what had happened. He might have missed his chance forever.
He went back to work, trying to forget about her. After all, he was engaged to be married, and he didn't need any distractions. He had a good job and a nice fiancée. He didn't need anything else.
Two days later, he was surprised to see her sitting at the same table where he worked. He almost dropped his tray of food. He quickly walked over to her and apologized for dropping it.
""Don't worry about it,"" she said. ""It's all right.""
""I'm sorry. I hope I didn't ruin your meal.""
""Not at all. It was just a little spill. No big deal.""
He smiled. ""Good. Now, let me clean it up.""
He grabbed a rag and cleaned it up as best he could. ""Here you go,"" he said. ""I hope you don't mind that I spilled it.""
""Of course not. Thank you.""
He felt awkward standing there, so he walked away. He couldn't believe she was still there. He couldn't stop thinking about her. He wanted to talk to her again, but he was afraid of making a fool of himself.
The next day, she came to eat lunch with her friend. She sat in the same seat as the previous day. This time, he didn't drop anything, and he was able to serve her without incident. He was relieved that she was still there.
Later that afternoon, she came in again. He served her and then waited until she was finished eating. He was nervous, but he knew he couldn't stay quiet anymore.",1093,-0.3439897593085074,-0.11205870760511592,0.4490785835063857,0.709999571002429,-0.17101661897638215

""Our rations last about three months, and we've used up half of them already,"" he answered. ""That means that if things don't improve soon, we won't be able to provide for our people for much longer. This is why I wanted to talk to you. I need you to help us find a way to solve this problem.""
My mind started racing. ""I'm afraid I don't have the experience you need for this,"" I told him honestly. ""I'm not trained in agriculture. You should ask Dr. Sato to come down here to Mars.""
""I know she's a scientist,"" President Kuklo said. ""But her job is to research how life originated on Earth, not to find a solution to a problem like this. And she's already working on something else at the moment. That's why I thought you might be a better person for the task.""
""You think I can do this?"" I asked him.
""Yes,"" he said with a nod. ""I have complete confidence in you.""
""Well,"" I said with a smile. ""That makes me feel better."" I paused for a few seconds before continuing. ""But let me tell you what I would need if I were going to help you out with this problem.""
""Go ahead,"" he said as he leaned back in his chair.
""First off, you need to send someone down to Earth to get some help,"" I said. ""They need to bring back soil samples from different locations around the planet. Then they need to mix it together in the labs so we can see if any of it has the ability to grow.""
""And how long will that take?"" he asked.
""It depends,"" I told him. ""The soil sample will only tell you part of the story. We need to do tests to see what kind of plant it might grow into."" I paused and took a deep breath before continuing. ""You're going to need at least one year, maybe two or three, to figure this out.""
""Do you have any other suggestions?"" he asked, leaning forward again.
""Well, another thing you could do is get more people involved,"" I told him. ""Maybe some of your political rivals who aren't currently on the council. If you had enough people working on it, it might make progress faster.""
""You think that's a good idea?"" he asked.
""Sure, why not? It'll get them out of their offices and doing something useful for once,"" I said with a laugh.
""I like it,"" President Kuklo said with a smile. ""We can send a message to the other members of the council and ask them if they'd be interested in helping out. Once they hear about the food supply problem, they'll probably want to get involved.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""But you also need to let them know that it will take a lot longer than one or two months to find a solution.""
""I agree with you on that,"" he said. ""And we'll need to make sure they understand that we can't just start growing crops out here on Mars. The plants need sunlight, which we don't have much of here on the planet.""
""I'll talk to Dr. Sato,"" I said. ""She's already working on some things with plants that can grow without the sun.""
""Good,"" President Kuklo said with a nod. ""Let me know when you've talked to her, and I'll put the word out to the others."" He stood up from his chair and looked down at me. ""Now, I'm going to go tell our agricultural team about this so they can start planning their next move. You can call me back if you have any questions.""
As the president left his office, I took a deep breath and sat back in my seat. I didn't really know what to think about the whole thing. We were going to have to work on a solution to the food shortage, but I wasn't sure how I was supposed to help with it. All I knew was that I would do whatever it took to keep our colony alive and thriving.

146,R_PLk6OYdqXeGzmmZ,ALL_HOR_1,Horror,All-Nighter,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was one I hadn't seen before. He had bright green eyes, black hair, and an ugly scar that ran across his right cheek. His mouth was wide open, as if he were screaming.
I turned my head to the side and saw another face in the mirror. This one had the same scar as the first man. It also had the same wide-open mouth, but this one seemed more excited than the other guy. His eyes were sparkling, almost like a cat's. He looked at me and smiled with perfect white teeth. Then he laughed so hard he had to wipe tears away from his eyes.
The two faces stared at each other for a moment before the first one disappeared. I heard the second man laughing as well and then I felt him crawling under my sheets. He pulled them off of me and threw them on the floor. He then grabbed me by the shoulders and pushed me down onto my knees.
I was terrified, not knowing what was going to happen next. The man crawled out from under the bed and stood up. He looked me straight in the eye and said, ""Don't be afraid.""
""Who are you?"" I asked.
He didn't answer. Instead, he reached out his hand and took mine. Then he led me through the mirror.
When I got to the other side, I found myself in a large bedroom with a king sized bed and a beautiful, four-poster canopy. A huge chandelier hung in the center of the ceiling above the bed and was covered with candles. There was another man sitting in a chair near the fireplace, reading a book. He looked up when he heard me enter the room.
""Well, look who's here,"" he said.
The man I had just met walked over to the other man and shook his hand. They both seemed to know each other very well.
""This is my brother,"" the first man said. ""We call him Jack.""
""Jack, this is my friend,"" the second man said. ""His name is Ben.""
They both looked at me and smiled.
""What's your name, young man?"" Jack asked.
""Ben.""
""My brother and I were hoping that you'd help us out. We need your help.""
""Why do you need my help?"" I asked.
""We want to find someone that we lost many years ago,"" Jack said.
""And who is this person?"" I asked.
""Her name is Anna,"" the first man said. ""She's my wife.""
""How long has it been since you've seen her?"" I asked.
""It's been a while now,"" Jack said. ""But we haven't given up hope that she'll return to us someday.""
""I think I can help you out,"" I said.
""How?"" Jack asked.
""There are things in this world that don't belong here,"" I said. ""They're not from our dimension and they come from another place.""
""That's right,"" Jack said. ""We've been looking for them ever since we lost Anna.""
""I'm sorry about your wife,"" I said. ""But I don't understand what you're getting at.""
""Ben, why don't you show him?"" Jack suggested. ""He's probably more qualified than anyone else on this earth to help us find what we need.""
""Okay, sure,"" I said. ""But where should we start? There are so many places in the world to search.""
""You're right, Ben,"" Jack said. ""There are millions of places that we could look.""
""Well then, why don't we narrow it down a little bit,"" I said. ""Why don't you tell me what kind of place you think Anna is?""
""Do you have any idea?"" Jack asked.
""I guess I don't know her well enough yet,"" I replied.
""How about the forest?"" Jack said. ""That seems like a good place to start.""
""The forest?"" I asked. ""Have you been there?""
""Yes,"" he replied. ""And I've seen many others like it. We found one near a town called New York, and another near the beach.""
""I haven't been to either of those places,"" I said. ""But I've never heard of any forests near either of those areas. And if they existed, I'm sure someone would have told me about them.""
""I agree,"" Jack said. ""So why don't we try to find one here in Texas.""
""Let's go to Texas,"" I said. ""It might be easier to find what we're looking for in a big place.""
Jack and his brother both smiled. Then Jack looked at me and said, ""If you'll come with us, I think we can help you find what you're looking for. And I think we can help you find what you're looking for as well.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""I'm ready whenever you are.""
""Great,"" he said. ""We'll leave right now.""
""But what about my house?"" I asked.
""Don't worry about your house,"" Jack said. ""We'll make sure everything is fine before we go. We won't leave until you say goodbye.""
I got out of bed and put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. The two men came into the room and stood next to each other. They both seemed happy that I agreed to go with them. Then they took my hand and led me out of the bedroom. We went downstairs and I saw my parents sitting at the kitchen table eating breakfast.
""Hi, Mom,"" I said.
""Good morning, Ben,"" she replied.
""Ben, I hope you don't mind if I ask you to go on a little trip today,"" my father said.
""No problem,"" I said. ""Just give me a couple of days to get packed up and I'll be gone.""
""That would be great,"" he said. ""I was hoping you'd come visit your sister and her family soon. Maybe you could bring some friends along this time.""
""I'd love to,"" I said. ""Maybe next month.""
""I'm looking forward to it,"" he replied.
""We'll call you when we get there,"" Jack said. ""And we'll call you every day.""
""Sounds good,"" my dad said. ""Have fun.""
""We will,"" Jack said. ""And we'll be back soon.""
Jack and his brother walked over to me and gave me a hug. They were both taller than me and looked strong enough to take down an elephant. After they left, my mother came over and kissed me on the forehead.
""You have to go, don't you?""",1097,-1.4022034948692332,-0.35168668572233924,-0.40564837035811796,-0.41562080918774513,-1.6605064811372587
147,R_3gOvk8UmUfIESGZ,LOW_HSF_1,Hard Sci-Fi,Low Rider,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. It was so warm, even in midwinter. The temperature would rise up to about thirty degrees Celsius as soon as the sun got high enough in the sky, then settle back down around ten or twelve C at night. It wasn't quite like Earth weather, but it wasn't so different from home either.
The walk from my apartment to the main building where the president had set up shop was only about two hundred meters, but it took some time to get there because of all the people who wanted to talk with me. I saw a lot more red than blue today. Not just on their skin, either; I saw it on their faces too. They were excited about our chances for the upcoming elections, and they didn't seem to mind that I had been born on Earth.
""Hey, Jack,"" called one of them. He came jogging toward me, waving. ""Have you seen what happened to those idiots in Congress?""
It took me a minute to understand what he was talking about. Then I realized that he meant the House of Representatives. There was a special session being held on the first day of spring, when both houses were supposed to be meeting. But only half of them showed up, and the other half didn't show up for the second day of the session either. That left just twenty members of congress sitting there debating a motion to impeach the president, which they failed to pass by three votes.
They're finally starting to wise up, I thought. I smiled and waved back at him as we walked through the crowds toward the presidential compound. As far as I could see, no one else seemed upset about it. No one was shouting insults. People weren't trying to get me to sign petitions for any of their candidates, and they didn't seem mad at me for supporting the current president. In fact, it seemed like most of them didn't care who became president; they were just happy that Congress wasn't going to shut itself down again.
""Good luck on your trip!"" someone called after us.
We reached the presidential headquarters without incident and were shown in right away. The president was waiting in front of a small conference table, surrounded by several secretaries and aides. When he spotted me approaching, he stood up and walked toward me with a wide smile on his face.
""Jack! What a surprise!""
""Good to see you, sir.""
""This way, please. Let's not waste any more time, shall we? You should be on a plane back home by now, unless there's something you want to discuss here?""
The president's office was larger and much nicer than mine, though I suppose he had the authority to upgrade it if he wanted. We sat down across from each other, and the president leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table and clasping his hands together.
""I've been getting a lot of calls lately from various people on Earth, and I have to tell you that they are very worried about you,"" he said.
""You don't need to worry about me,"" I told him, ""but I'll do whatever I can to help Earth while I'm here.""
""There are some things that need doing on Earth,"" he replied, ""and you have the unique position of being able to make those things happen. So let's start with this: I'd like to announce that I am endorsing you for election.""
""Thank you, sir,"" I said, ""that's very nice of you.""
""What I really mean is: I want you to run. This is the opportunity for which I came to Mars."" He paused for a moment. ""And I'm sure you know how important this will be.""
""Yes, sir,"" I said, nodding slowly. ""If there's anything I can do—""
""Don't mention it. And in the meantime, I want to send along a message that I would like to deliver personally: that we will provide all of our assistance to your Earth-based efforts to deal with your climate crisis and its impact on the global economy. But there is something else we need you to do. Something that may seem difficult for someone who has never visited Earth before, but which will make a huge difference on Earth.""
""Sir,"" I said carefully, ""what exactly do you have in mind?""
He leaned back in his chair and looked up at the ceiling for a few moments. Then he turned around and looked me straight in the eyes, as serious as I had ever seen him.
""We're sending you back to Earth, Jack.""
""What?""
""You heard me correctly. You're leaving Mars, and you'll be returning to Earth shortly.""
I couldn't believe it. My heart started pounding in my chest, and my mouth went dry.
""How long am I going to be gone for?"" I asked.
""Not too long. Maybe six months or so. Long enough to get the job done, but short enough that we can still hold elections next year without you having missed too much time on Mars.""
""Six months?"" I repeated.
""It's nothing to be frightened about. There's a good chance that your mission will turn out to be much shorter than that. If the climate issues don't require your attention after all, we'll probably be ready to bring you home within a week or so.""
""Are you sure about this?"" I asked. ""Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, if I don't have to go—if there's no urgency about it all—maybe I won't mind staying a little longer, so long as you promise to send me right back once it's done. It seems kind of dangerous for me to go back and forth.""
The president smiled. ""It's not too bad,"" he said. ""There are ways of protecting yourself against some of the effects of Earth gravity. You'll be fine.""
I nodded. ""Well . . ."" I said, looking down at my lap for a moment, ""that certainly sounds intriguing, sir. Thank you.""
The president shook my hand, and then I stood up and returned to my quarters to pack my belongings. I tried to keep my mind focused on the mission, but I kept wondering what would become of my life on Mars. I had already met so many new people, made so many new friends, gotten used to life in space. How would I ever manage if I had to leave all that behind again?
I spent most of the day packing, since the president had scheduled a flight for me that evening. I took everything with me, including my personal items and all of my research data. Even though I knew that it would take years for it to become useful in Earth orbit, I brought every last sample of Martian soil that I had collected over the past seven years. After all, it wouldn't do to have too much work lying around on Mars.
I checked out of my hotel and boarded the ship that would carry me back to Earth. It was the same model spaceship that had brought me here in the first place, so I knew how to operate everything inside, but I didn't feel comfortable piloting it myself yet. I felt safer knowing that it had been built by experts from Earth rather than by engineers from Mars. Still, the flight wasn't long and I managed to sleep through most of it. The flight crew woke me up when we were about an hour from landing, but even then, I hardly noticed the time passing. The whole thing was like a dream.
When we finally landed, I climbed out of the ship and took a look at the city around me for the first time in nearly seven years.",1354,1.106299661633912,0.3516804214340488,1.1378802759555156,1.6455816768026823,1.5342049878643789
148,R_27we47mTerHIVH6,ACE_HR_6,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her hair had been dark then—now it's a bright gold that looks as if it has flames inside of it when she moves. It makes my heart ache to look at her sometimes. And those eyes...they're a beautiful shade of green. I've never seen anything like them before or since. They make me want to do things I shouldn't even think about doing with her.
She doesn't know who I am, but everyone else does. That's because they all talk about me behind my back. The men whisper how lucky I am, while the women say I'm a fool for putting up with such treatment. But what can I do? If I don't have any money, no woman will ever marry me. No matter how much I love her.
I've known for quite some time now that she is going to leave me someday soon. I just hope she finds someone better than I am so that I won't feel too bad about losing her. I would give anything to be able to tell her exactly what I'm thinking right now.
But I can't.
""It's not fair!""
Kaitlyn stomped her foot on the ground. ""No more! I'll go find someone else to teach.""
""You should stay here,"" Lark said. He didn't want her to go away either. His father had told him to keep an eye out for her. Lark didn't mind. In fact, he thought she might be fun to play around with. Maybe she wouldn't notice him watching her every day. Then again, maybe she would.
He knew he wasn't supposed to have feelings for anyone yet. There were too many things he still needed to learn. He couldn't afford to get distracted by girls. So instead, he kept his distance from Kaitlyn. As far as he could remember, this was the first girl he had ever met. Even though she hadn't noticed him, he found himself staring at her whenever he could. He wondered if she felt the same way.
""Why?"" she asked. ""Are you going somewhere?""
Lark looked over at her. Her eyes widened slightly as she took in his expression. When she realized he was looking at her, she blushed and looked down at the floor. She stood quickly. ""If I'm not there tomorrow morning, send someone to check on me,"" she said.
Then she turned and walked toward the door. She stopped halfway there and glanced back at him once more before disappearing outside. Lark watched after her until she disappeared into the darkness.
When he went back inside, he headed straight for the kitchen. His mother had already prepared dinner, so he grabbed a piece of bread and ate it slowly. He didn't have very much appetite lately. Whenever he tried to eat something, he ended up throwing it all up afterward. He wished he could explain why to his parents, but he couldn't bring himself to do so. After all, he wasn't sure what was wrong with him. He only knew that whatever it was made him miserable.
His mother came into the room carrying a plate of food and sat next to him. ""How are you feeling today?"" she asked.
""Fine.""
""Did you hear about the fire last night?"" she asked.
""Yes, I heard.""
""A few people lost their homes, including a man who works here at the tavern.""
""Oh?""
""He used to live upstairs above the bar. Now he doesn't have anywhere to live.""
""What happened to his home?""
""It burned down.""
""Is he okay?"" Lark asked.
His mother smiled. ""Don't worry about him. He knows we'll help him out. We always do.""
""Really? How did it happen?""
""Someone set fire to it. You know, there have been a lot of fires lately.""
""Who started them?"" Lark asked.
""That's what they say,"" she replied.
""Do you think someone's trying to hurt us?""
""We're fine, son. Don't you worry about us,"" she said. She put her hand on top of his head. ""Everything will work itself out in the end. You just need to trust in the gods. Everything happens for a reason.""
Lark nodded. He knew his mother meant well. Still, he couldn't shake the fear that someone would try to hurt them. He wanted to believe everything would turn out fine, but he couldn't forget how angry his father had seemed earlier that day.
The sound of footsteps coming down the stairs drew Lark's attention away from his thoughts. He looked over to see a young man enter the room. At first glance, he appeared to be around fifteen years old, but Lark suspected he was actually older.
""There you are,"" the boy said. ""I haven't seen you for weeks.""
""I've just been busy,"" Lark answered.
""You need to pay more attention to your studies,"" the boy said. ""They're important, especially if you want to become an apprentice one day.""
""I know."" Lark sighed. ""My father keeps telling me that.""
The boy rolled his eyes. ""Your father doesn't know what he's talking about. All he cares about is making money. What good is having money if you don't have any time to spend with your family?""
""I understand what he means,"" Lark said. ""But we can't make any money without customers coming in.""
""So why aren't you spending time with them?"" the boy asked.
Lark shook his head. ""I can't. I'm helping my father run the tavern. Besides, if I didn't help him out, he'd probably quit. Then where would we be? We'd lose our place to stay.""
""I don't know about that,"" the boy replied. ""You seem like a smart kid. Why don't you take over the business when your father retires? It would give you plenty of time to study while earning enough money to support yourself. And then you wouldn't have to worry about running the place.""
Lark shrugged. ""Maybe someday. For now, I have to do what I can to help him out.""
""Well, I have to go. I have to help out my father,"" the boy said. ""Good luck to you. I hope you find what you're looking for. And remember what I said. Money isn't everything. It's not worth sacrificing your own happiness for it. Trust me.",1070,0.7482627188708949,0.738966295726745,0.22596126833423016,1.666147249189632,0.43176182400571955
149,R_30iZjGQ7W5N7f4X,ALL_HF_10,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Is this the place?"" asked the wizard, looking around in surprise as he stepped down off his horse.
""This is it,"" answered the old woman. ""I've never been here before but I heard tales of it. It's been abandoned for centuries now.""
""But there are people here?"" asked the mage. He scanned the horizon for any sign of movement, but saw none.
""I don't think so,"" replied the old woman. ""If there were, you'd have seen them by now."" She shook her head. ""There was talk that there might be someone living here again recently, though I'm not sure if they're still alive. If you can find the man who lives here, though, he'll know what to do.""
""What about these two?"" asked the mage as he pointed toward the towers. ""Why are they empty?""
""Oh, those two? They belong to the lord of this valley. He keeps his treasure in the one on the right, and he has a large army camped outside the other. You won't get very far trying to steal from him.""
""So how did you end up with these?"" he asked. ""It's not as if they belong to you.""
""They're mine,"" she answered. ""He just lets me use them. It's better than having nothing."" She paused, then looked at the wizard. ""You're not going to rob the place, are you?""
The old woman smiled. ""Of course not! I only brought you here because I thought it would be useful for you to see what you were dealing with. You can take the treasure back with you and we can all live happily ever after."" She laughed.
""I don't think that's how it works,"" said the wizard.
""Well, maybe not. But you'll have to be careful when you leave. The lord will have eyes and ears everywhere.""
""And you're going to help us escape?""
""I'm going to make sure you don't get caught, no matter what you do. So I'll have to help you get away, somehow. Maybe I'll be able to slip out with you or something. Who knows? But you mustn't get caught.""
""How am I supposed to get out without being noticed?""
""Just pretend you belong there and act like you know where you're going. Don't talk to anyone and keep your head down.""
""That shouldn't be too difficult,"" said the mage. He scratched his chin and considered his options. ""I suppose we should get started then. We don't want to waste any time.""
The old woman nodded. ""There's a path that leads to the towers from the village, so we might as well start there.""
She pointed off toward the west, toward the tower on the right.
The mage nodded. ""Sounds good."" He looked around. ""I guess I'll go first.""
The old woman shook her head. ""No, you go second. That way if anyone sees you coming they'll think you're going to steal something.""
He frowned but said nothing.
The old woman smiled and patted the mage's arm. ""I know it doesn't seem fair, but you have to remember that this is my home. You don't have any reason to trust me. If you go first, everyone in the village will wonder what's going on, and they might start asking questions.""
""Fair enough,"" agreed the wizard. He turned and walked to the edge of the village, then stopped and looked around. The old woman was right; there was no one there, which meant that he'd have to rely on his own wits for the moment.
He took a deep breath and started walking toward the tower, trying to look like he belonged there. His cloak fluttered behind him in the breeze and his staff made an occasional clicking noise against the ground. He reached the base of the tower and climbed up the steps to its main entrance.
A small door was set into the wall and the mage reached out and grasped the handle. The door swung open easily, revealing a narrow hallway that ran back and forth along the length of the tower. It looked as though it had been used for storage at one point, with crates and barrels piled everywhere.
The mage stepped inside and started to walk down the corridor, his eyes searching the room as he went.
He paused in front of a large chest and examined it, but found nothing of interest inside. He continued on and passed several other rooms before finally reaching another doorway. This time the door opened inward and revealed a small, cramped room. A bed and some chairs were pushed up against one side of the room, leaving only a little space between them and the walls. A table was placed in the middle of the room and a few candles were lit in various places around it.
There was someone sitting at the table.
""Hello?"" said the wizard.
The figure turned to face him, then jumped out of his chair and began to run out the door. The mage followed quickly after.
They ran through the tower and out into a wide hallway. The mage slowed his pace and caught up with the figure just before it reached the stairway leading up.
The man spun around and pointed a dagger at the wizard, but before he could say anything, the mage grabbed the blade and pulled it from his hand. He then slammed the man's arm into the wall, causing him to fall to the floor.
The mage grabbed his hair and forced his head back. ""Who are you?""
The man struggled for a moment, but the wizard tightened his grip.
""I-I'm not sure,"" stammered the man. ""But I think I know what you are.""
""You do?"" asked the mage.
""Yes. You're a wizard!""
The mage released his grip and let go of the man's hair. ""I am.""
""So are we! I mean, me and my friends. We've been waiting for someone to come rescue us."" He looked around. ""Where is everyone?""
The mage sighed and shook his head. ""They don't want to be rescued, that's all. They've been waiting here for years and they're used to being alone. I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.""
""Wait!"" said the man. ""Are you going to let us out? Please, please, I won't tell anyone about you. Just let us go.""
""And why would I do that?"" asked the mage. ""I can't imagine it would be very difficult for you to escape if I wanted to.""",1150,-1.6904485610493138,-0.8863789241040766,-0.5693899231817383,0.0969416360357344,-1.8315453448476504
150,R_1MZ1rEZ7gzDiByp,ACE_HR_10,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The way she moved made every hair on his body stand up straight, from his scalp to the tips of his toes. He could barely breathe when she smiled at him.
He couldn't even speak. His tongue had turned to sandpaper. It took all of his strength not to run out of there, just to get away from that smile and those eyes. But he didn't leave. Instead, he stood by the door until she left. Then he went back inside and washed the taste of her off of himself with soap and water, then scrubbed again.
It wasn't until he heard the sound of her voice that he realized he hadn't been listening to what she said. Her accent was so thick it was almost unintelligible, but the words themselves were beautiful.
She told him she liked his eyes, that they were dark and deep, and he wanted to know how old she was because he thought maybe he could be the father of her child. When he asked if she would marry him, she laughed at him. ""You're too young,"" she said, ""and I'm too old.""
And then she left.
That night he dreamed about her. She came to him in a dream, and he followed her through a forest full of wild flowers. They walked along an endless road, hand-in-hand. At last they reached a castle surrounded by high walls and tall towers. In its shadow, he knew, lay a woman's heart, and he knew that it belonged to her. And he loved her, and she loved him.
In the morning, he woke up sweating and shaking, knowing that she was real. That she was waiting for him somewhere in this world. And he was afraid. Afraid that someday someone else would find her first.
But he was determined to stay here, and he did. For a year, he watched her, waited for her, tried to learn more about her. Then he began to work in the tavern. Slowly, slowly, he got closer to her.
At last she spoke to him, and he understood why she laughed at him. She was older than he had imagined. She was nearly twenty years older than he was. She told him she already had a husband and a family. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, and he meant it. He would have given anything to take her place as the wife of the innkeeper, to give up everything he owned, to live here forever. Anything except his name. He never told anyone who he really was.
""What are you doing?"" she whispered, and her breath smelled sweet and spicy. ""Don't do it, please don't do it.""
He stopped. Stared down into the fire, wondering if he should tell her, or if he shouldn't say anything at all. Finally, he answered softly, ""I've been thinking of giving myself another name.""
She looked up at him. There were tears in her eyes. ""Another name? Why?""
Because he was afraid, he thought. Because he knew he wouldn't ever be able to stop now, no matter what happened next. Because he would always love her.
She nodded. ""If you want me to call you something different, then you can choose whatever you want.""
He smiled at her. ""My mother called me Peter. Is that all right?""
Her lips twitched. ""Yes,"" she said finally, and he felt himself smiling, too.
Then he kissed her.
They spent their nights together, lying in each other's arms beneath the moonlight. They made love under the stars, on the soft grass between the rows of wheat. Sometimes she cried, and sometimes he did, but mostly they simply held each other.
Afterward, they would sit close to each other on the porch swing and talk. They talked about their dreams, their hopes, their fears, and she listened to him without interrupting. He learned things about her; she learned things about him. He told her stories about his life, and she told him stories about hers.
Sometimes, she brought him food and drink from the kitchen. Once, she gave him a cup of tea laced with brandy, and he drank it in one gulp. Then she kissed him, and he felt drunker still, and he lost control of himself completely.
Later, he slept in her bed. The sheets were cool against his bare skin, but he didn't mind. He was warm enough.
When he woke up the next day, he found her sitting beside his pillow. Her hair fell over his shoulder like a silken curtain.
""How long has it been since we met?"" she asked him. ""One month, two months, three months?""
""Four,"" he answered. ""Four months.""
She smiled sadly. ""Will you wait for me, Peter? Will you promise me that?""
He leaned forward and pressed his forehead against her cheek. ""I promise,"" he whispered.
And she smiled. ""Good,"" she said. Then she took his face in both hands and pulled his head down toward hers, and he opened his mouth and let her kiss him.
For a while after that, he forgot all about the future, or at least, he pretended not to think about it. But soon he realized that he couldn't ignore the fact that she would die one day, and he wondered what he would do then. Would he go back to the city and start all over again? Or would he try to find someone new? Someone younger, with fewer wrinkles?
And then he remembered what she had told him before, about having a son. He decided he couldn't just forget about that, either.
So he left the village. He rode his horse out of the valley and away from her, back toward the town where he'd grown up. On his way there, he found a boy tending sheep and told him that he needed to borrow his horse. The boy was surprised to see him, but he agreed.
Peter rode the horse into the city. It wasn't hard to find the inn where his parents lived, but when he arrived, he saw that his father wasn't there. His mother greeted him with a hug. ""Where have you been, my darling?"" she asked him. ""We worried about you. You haven't come home in so very long. What's wrong? Are you well?""
He sat down and told her what had happened. About the woman he loved, and how he had promised to be with her. How he had lied to her, and he told her that it was his fault.
His mother shook her head. ""Oh, my poor boy. I'm so sorry. But you know what? This is exactly what she wanted. She wanted you to be brave, to be strong. To be a man, not a child. Now that you're here, she'll be happy. She will be at peace.",1168,1.4864770768600633,0.7421290132741327,0.314641255888353,1.2713270326603507,-0.7073435094036733
151,R_3dDKLcHv5llKKEp,GEN_HF_4,High Fantasy,Genesis,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. There were no people, only horses tethered to posts that seemed to be part of an old stable.
A man stepped out from behind one of the nearby buildings and approached them as they rode into town. He had been thin and sickly even before he'd come down with a fever following his encounter with the shadow-beasts. Now he was gaunt and frail, though his eyes remained bright. His hair was matted with sweat and dirt, and there were several days' worth of stubble covering his chin.
""I'm sorry I wasn't here to meet you,"" he said, holding out his hand. ""It's just... well...""
Tristan took the older man's hand without hesitation and shook it firmly. ""No apologies are necessary.""
He turned his horse around and led them toward the gate of the village. ""Please, dismount and stay on the ground. No one wants to see your faces until you're ready. If any of our neighbors see you, we could lose everything.""
They did as instructed and followed him through the gates. He pointed to a large building near the center of the village. ""You can put your things inside. The innkeeper will take good care of them for us while we're gone.""
Tristan nodded in thanks and led his friends to the inn. They followed him up a flight of stairs that opened onto a second floor. Four doors lined the walls to either side, each with a piece of paper pinned to the wood next to it. Their host explained what they meant.
""Room 1 is yours if you want it. Room 2, 3, and 4 are mine. I'll try not to keep you awake too late.""
Vlora had been looking over the room numbers as Tristan gave his explanation. She pointed to number three. ""That's my room?""
""It's fine,"" Tristan assured her. ""There's something odd about this place, but I don't think anyone has ever gotten hurt.""
She frowned. ""And you didn't think we should know that?""
He shrugged. ""If I thought it would make a difference, I would have told you. You've got nothing to worry about.""
He went back downstairs to check on the horses while Vlora and Yvonne unpacked their bags. When she was done, Vlora walked back upstairs to find Tristan still standing outside the door to the room. He stood with his arms crossed, staring at the wooden sign hanging above the door.
""What does it say?""
Tristan tapped his foot impatiently. ""Nothing. It doesn't say anything. But every time I look at it, I get an uneasy feeling. I keep thinking it means something.""
""Perhaps you're nervous because it seems abandoned,"" Vlora suggested. ""Have you seen how far away it is? There are no signs of life within miles. No farmers, no caravans, no traders. It's quiet except for the sound of the river and a few birds.""
""Maybe,"" he allowed, ""but it feels wrong to me.""
""What do you mean?""
He held up the sign again. ""This says 'The Inn at the End of the World.' What kind of inn has an end?""
Vlora stared at the sign. ""Good point.""
""I suppose I shouldn't be surprised,"" Vlora added. ""We're in the middle of nowhere after all. It wouldn't be strange to find ourselves alone.""
Tristan's expression darkened. ""You know, I always wondered why we never saw another soul on those journeys. We traveled a great distance through places where other armies might have made camp. The Empire should be in a position to see us coming, and yet we passed through dozens of towns and villages, and no one ever came out to greet us. In some ways, it almost felt like we were being ignored.""
""They weren't ignoring us, Tris,"" Vlora said gently. ""They were just taking precautions. You have to understand—the Empire is very dangerous. They've conquered much of the continent and now they're trying to expand. People who live in these parts are understandably worried about the Empire.""
He nodded slowly, but his mood hadn't improved. ""Maybe that's true. Maybe they were just scared. But I don't think so.""
""Why not?""
He sighed. ""Because I was there. All the way at the front of the line, marching hard and fast to the border. I remember seeing a lot of fear and terror, but I also remember knowing that they were afraid of me. They were terrified of me.""
Vlora frowned. ""I don't understand.""
""I'm sure you don't. But I met the enemy. I spoke to them face-to-face. And I know they feared me because I am the Beast of War. That's what they called me.""
""What?""
Tristan smiled bitterly. ""I wasn't lying to you when I said it was a long story. I spent years fighting against the Empire, and I learned a lot. One of the things I learned was that there are many names for me: The Beast of War, the Destroyer, and a few others. But the name I liked best was the one they used to address me directly. The name they called me first.""
""What's that?""
""The Beast of War. They called me that because I killed everyone.""
Vlora stared at him blankly, and he realized that she wouldn't believe him unless he showed her. He reached into his pack and pulled out the letter he'd received from the Redeemers. ""Look at this. This is the letter I received from the Redeemer general after I returned to the capital. You know, the one that was intercepted by the Empire and brought to the Emperor? Look.""
He handed her the missive.
She read it quickly, then folded it back up and handed it back. ""I don't understand. How could you have killed thousands of people without anyone noticing?""
""Because I was the Beast of War,"" he replied flatly.
Vlora shook her head. ""That doesn't make sense. You defeated the entire army of the Empire single-handedly.""
""Yes, I did. I slew the emperor himself. I destroyed the palace and burned the city of Ostrander to the ground. I slaughtered the entire Imperial Guard and left over thirty thousand dead in my wake.""",1092,0.26650275014323194,-1.0864865033888167,-0.5354941246125913,0.7407871451778182,-0.2610216514041454
152,R_2EicPtzhONW59xc,OUR_HF_8,High Fantasy,Ouroboros,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Where are we?"" Elisabeth asked as they rode towards the settlement.
""We're about halfway between Solanis and Varni,"" Erland replied. ""It's a common stop for merchants travelling between those two cities.""
""Is it safe?""
""I'm sure it is,"" he assured her, keeping his voice calm. His hand had remained around the hilt of his sword ever since leaving the castle and he hadn't let go of it until now.
Elisabeth's eyes narrowed suspiciously at him. ""Are you going to let me finish my question?""
He sighed heavily, though whether he did so in exasperation or just the effort of holding on to his anger was unclear. ""I promise I won't do anything reckless without letting you know first."" He lowered his hand. ""As much as it pains me to admit it, we'll need your help if we want to get inside that tower.""
""And why would I want to help you?"" she asked, the annoyance clear in her tone.
He smiled reassuringly at her and patted the horse's neck. ""Because I can see in the dark.""
""What?""
""Look at my face,"" he said softly. ""Can you see anything there?""
She frowned. ""You look fine.""
He grinned widely at her, then pulled out his lantern and waved it back and forth over his face.
""Oh!"" she cried as the light flashed over him. ""Why didn't you say so earlier?""
""That's because I'm not a complete moron.""
She rolled her eyes but laughed anyway. ""All right. So, what is this place?""
""It's called Portol. It used to be a bustling settlement with several towers around the lake, but they're all deserted now. Some say the land was cursed or that the lord of the area was an evil sorcerer who turned his own people against one another. Most likely, it was just an isolated spot along the trade routes where nobody wanted to live.
""Whatever the reason, the lord abandoned the town a long time ago, leaving the towers as ruins. He built a new manor house in the forest on the other side of the river, but most of the inhabitants have moved to Varni in search of better opportunities.""
""But why would anyone want to move here? What's left to do? Fish the lake or chop down trees?"" Elisabeth asked skeptically.
Erland chuckled. ""Nothing you would be interested in, I imagine. They probably just need more hands for the new farm they're establishing near the lake. That's why they're hiring.""
Elisabeth's eyebrows shot up as she looked at him curiously. ""A farm? Do they plan to start a farm?""
He shook his head. ""No, that was just me reading into the conversation we overheard. The old lord said he was hiring more guards.""
She snorted. ""Why would they do that?""
""Because I don't think the last ones lived very long after he told them about it."" Erland gestured towards the tower to their right with his thumb. ""They were all dead by morning.""
Elisabeth shivered. ""Do you think they came to kill the new guards too?""
He nodded. ""Probably.""
""And there are so many of them that they can afford to hire more?"" she asked, looking around the village suspiciously. ""How much money does this place even produce? There aren't any shops, no stalls. Are they growing anything on those hills over there?""
""I don't know,"" he replied as he kicked his horse forward, keeping it well out of range of the others. ""But I can tell you what they're not doing…and that's fishing. The river Tethys runs all the way to the lake, and the only way to get water is to draw from it."" He pulled the reins and guided the horse over to the tower where the two sentinels stood guard, then dismounted and tied the horse to the hitching post outside the entrance. He reached into a saddlebag he had strapped to the horse's back and pulled out the key, unlocking the door. ""Come on, I'll show you around.""
He held the lantern aloft as he led her through the dark interior of the tower, leading her to the staircase that descended down into the basement. They made their way carefully, in case anyone was hiding inside. The staircase ended at a small hallway with four doors along one side. Two of the doors were closed; one was slightly ajar; and the fourth, directly across from them, was open.
Erland opened the door and stepped inside, Elisabeth following close behind him. The room was bare except for an iron safe, several boxes of candles, and some sacks full of food. In the corner sat a large wooden table with three chairs around it. The floor beneath them had been swept clean of debris, but not cleaned very thoroughly. A single chair had been placed before the table, facing away from the door. The only other piece of furniture in the room was the lone bed positioned against one wall. It was empty and showed no sign that anyone had slept there recently.
""Now, we know that the first group of guards that died weren't attacked by this place itself,"" Erland said softly. ""I'm pretty certain that they were poisoned by whoever was trying to kill us.""
""How do you know?"" Elisabeth asked.
He frowned. ""Because I just did.""
She glanced at him curiously. ""You mean…you think someone is here now?""
Erland nodded. ""Yes.""
Elisabeth swallowed hard. ""I don't suppose you have any idea who it could be? Maybe I could talk to them first. You know, see what they're like, what their goals are.""
Erland shook his head. ""I already tried. Whoever is inside there doesn't want to talk. Not to me at least.""
""How can you tell?"" she asked. ""It's so dark in here; I can't even see your face.""
He pulled down the lantern and pointed towards a small section of the ceiling directly over the table. ""The light's not reflecting off the glass on the lantern. That means whoever is in there is using a different source of light. And you can tell who's talking based on the way their words bounce off the walls, right?""
Elisabeth nodded. ""So?""
He chuckled. ""It means that someone is whispering.""
Her eyes widened slightly. ""They're still alive, then?""
""I'd bet my life on it,"" he replied. ""Though, I'm not sure if I should be pleased or afraid. The last time we went up against an enemy that used magic, you were pretty useless. I hope this is going to be easier for you to deal with.""",1164,1.9157217357386032,2.2241803605348505,1.6030082673372867,1.4257295706758197,1.8158225112158222
153,R_21yVnAVq4SEeMey,BAS_HR_6,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been so busy that day with customers who wanted to talk about their problems and ask for advice that she hadn't caught his eye until it was too late. When he finally realized what she was doing, he couldn't help but stare. She wore an old-fashioned dress of black wool, cut low on her neckline and showing off a lot more cleavage than he liked. Her hair was long and loose, falling down over her shoulders as if it were made from spun gold. It was such a pretty shade of blonde, and it seemed to glow against the dark color of her dress. The way she held herself reminded him of a cat—her head up high, chin out, eyes narrowed in disdain. But there was something else about her that drew his attention. There was no mistaking it; she was beautiful. Even though he knew better, he could not take his eyes off her.
He watched her as she drank her ale and ate some bread and cheese. He kept stealing glances at her even when he wasn't looking directly at her. His gaze would wander back to her every few minutes, but she never noticed him. She didn't seem to notice anyone except the people she spoke to or the other men who came by to flirt with her.
After she finished eating, she got up and went outside to smoke a pipe. That's when he decided to try to speak to her. He approached her and asked if she needed any assistance. She turned around, startled, then smiled at him. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""You startled me.""
""It's all right,"" he replied. ""What can I do for you?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Are you new here? You don't look familiar.""
""No, I've lived here most of my life. What can I do for you?""
Her smile widened. ""Well, I just need someone to carry this stuff to my room for me."" She handed him a large bag filled with clothes and shoes.
He took the bag and followed her upstairs. As they walked along, he tried to think of something clever to say to get her attention again. Finally, he blurted out, ""Do you know what happened to the king's daughter?""
She stopped walking and stared at him. ""Excuse me?""
""The princess. Do you know why she ran away?""
""Why should I care?"" she asked. ""I haven't seen her since she left home.""
""That's because she is dead,"" he said.
""Dead? How did she die?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Everyone says she died in childbirth, but I heard that she was murdered. Someone killed her baby and then stabbed her.""
""Oh, dear,"" she said. ""Did she have a husband?""
""Yes, but I don't think he knows anything about it yet. They're still searching for her body. If they find it, then he'll be notified.""
""Where will they search?""
""They won't tell us. All we know is that they are going to search everywhere.""
""So, how do you know she's dead?"" she asked.
""Because she was supposed to marry Prince Arvin, but now he has no wife. So, everyone thinks that the prince must have done it. And if he did, then he would want to hide the evidence so no one would ever suspect him.""
""But who could kill the princess without being caught?"" she asked.
He shrugged. ""Maybe someone who knew her very well. Maybe someone she trusted.""
""And why would she trust them?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Because they loved her, maybe.""
""How do you know she was pregnant?""
""Because her maid told me. She said she was carrying twins.""
""Twins?"" she repeated. ""Really? Why would she have two babies?""
""I don't know. Maybe she already had one child and wanted another.""
She shook her head. ""I don't understand women. I only know about men. Men always want to make more children, especially after they get married. Women usually don't want to.""
""Well, I guess that makes sense,"" he said.
""Does it really? I mean, I've never thought about it before.""
He nodded. ""I suppose it does.""
When they reached her door, he set the bag down and helped her take off her coat. Then she opened her trunk and pulled out several dresses.
""Can you put these in my room for me?"" she asked.
He picked up the bag and carried it inside while she changed. When she was ready to go downstairs, she thanked him and gave him a small coin.
""Thank you for your help,"" she said.
As he left, he wondered whether she would ever see him again. He hoped she would, but he wasn't sure. He wished he had spoken to her earlier, but he couldn't change what had happened. He might have missed his chance forever.
He went back to work, trying to forget about her. After all, he was engaged to be married, and he didn't need any distractions. He had a good job and a nice fiancée. He didn't need anything else.
Two days later, he was surprised to see her sitting at the same table where he worked. He almost dropped his tray of food. He quickly walked over to her and apologized for dropping it.
""Don't worry about it,"" she said. ""It's all right.""
""I'm sorry. I hope I didn't ruin your meal.""
""Not at all. It was just a little spill. No big deal.""
He smiled. ""Good. Now, let me clean it up.""
He grabbed a rag and cleaned it up as best he could. ""Here you go,"" he said. ""I hope you don't mind that I spilled it.""
""Of course not. Thank you.""
He felt awkward standing there, so he walked away. He couldn't believe she was still there. He couldn't stop thinking about her. He wanted to talk to her again, but he was afraid of making a fool of himself.
The next day, she came to eat lunch with her friend. She sat in the same seat as the previous day. This time, he didn't drop anything, and he was able to serve her without incident. He was relieved that she was still there.
Later that afternoon, she came in again. He served her and then waited until she was finished eating. He was nervous, but he knew he couldn't stay quiet anymore.",1093,-0.06258414515870721,-0.12462478545325263,0.880707625076281,0.1330515335638176,1.2845112388920257
154,R_1dbnlOiONzTpE57,OUR_HF_4,High Fantasy,Ouroboros,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Do you know if there are any people here?"" asked Red.
""No. But I'm certain they won't harm us,"" said Maddy. ""If there had been anyone left to see us arrive, we'd have seen them.""
They followed the road until it reached a clearing where a large stone building stood surrounded by several smaller buildings that looked like storage sheds or stables. Several people were gathered around the front entrance and one of them waved at the children to come over.
""Welcome to the village of Gournon,"" said the man as he stepped forward to greet them. His clothes were loose fitting, made from what appeared to be wool and linen. The colors on his tunic matched those of his clothing. He was of an age with Red and Maddy but his face was lined with many years. He looked at them suspiciously before smiling broadly. ""You are from the east? You must be new in these lands. Let me introduce myself. I am Sir Marcus. I was raised here and would be honored to be your guide.""
The children followed the man down the road to where a number of other men were sitting on stone benches around a small fire. They introduced themselves to the others and Sir Marcus led them inside one of the larger buildings that looked to have been a barracks. Several people sat at a long table eating and talking among themselves. Others were working at tables nearby. At a far wall there was a small open area where several men were playing games. A small girl ran through the room giggling, stopping to wave at the children as she went. She didn't look much older than eight.
""These are all refugees that arrived with us some months ago. There are about two hundred of them living here in the valley.""
The children had never seen so many people in one place before, and they were still amazed at how comfortable everyone seemed to be with each other. Everyone smiled and nodded to the newcomers and it looked as though no one was left out of the conversation. As soon as he had introduced the children, Sir Marcus turned his attention back to their questions.
""You mentioned you needed to get to the town of Darnassus?"" asked Sir Marcus. ""That is the name of the closest major city. It is also one of the greatest trading cities in all of Azeroth. What can I do to help? Will you stay here tonight?""
The children could barely contain themselves. ""We can't! We need to go right away!""
Sir Marcus's face fell and his eyes grew sad. ""I am sorry but I'm afraid I cannot let you leave. You have no way to get back and there are plenty of people here who have traveled that road alone and found themselves unable to continue.""
Red leaned in close to Maddy. ""What happened?""
""He means we'll die,"" said Maddy quietly. She could feel the dread coming off Red in waves and she couldn't believe how calm he remained. ""There's no way around it.""
""No one has ever returned from that road, but we keep hoping for good news every year. Every winter when the snow falls we hold a celebration to honor those who were lost on their journey. Their names are written down in the books here."" He pointed to an open cabinet nearby.
The children looked at each other. ""Their families come back and celebrate them?""
""No. No one ever comes back. It's been nearly twenty years and not a single person has returned.""
Red nodded and continued to stare into the distance.
""Well, there's no point in talking about it now,"" said Maddy. ""Let's just get to Darnassus.""
The children were escorted out of the village by Sir Marcus, who assured them that they would be safe. When the last light of sunset had disappeared behind the mountains the three children headed south along the river until they found a narrow trail heading up the mountain side. The trail was treacherous, particularly because of the number of times they needed to climb over fallen trees or haul themselves over rocks. The children kept close to the river and when night fell they pushed on, still following the river. They walked for several more hours before stopping to rest. Red looked at his watch. It was just after midnight.
""We need to keep going. If we don't reach Darnassus tonight, we'll be forced to spend the next few days there.""
Maddy pulled the leather pouch she wore around her neck from under her shirt and held it close to her face. ""We have enough money to buy food if we have to,"" she said. She looked up at Red who stood with his hands on his hips, looking down at her. He seemed to be trying to make himself as small as possible. ""Do you think anyone will be out here?"" asked Maddy.
He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. ""No, I don't. There isn't anywhere to stay, so we'd be better off continuing on tomorrow.""
Maddy looked at him like he was crazy. ""But what about this? You heard Sir Marcus. No one has ever come back!""
Red closed his eyes and pressed his forehead against his knee. He stood for a moment and then looked up. ""I'm sorry Maddy, but I'm not ready to die.""
Maddy wanted to hug him and tell him that everything would be all right, but she knew that wasn't true. Her brother had always been fearless, even when it came to facing enemies. She could only imagine what was going through his head. What was he thinking about now? Was he worried for their safety? Did he worry that someone was watching them? Or perhaps he was terrified of dying alone, just like everyone else who had tried to find their way home.
She looked at the bag hanging around her neck. ""You know I have my own money in here. If you won't come with me, at least take some and leave the rest for us. We can get some food and be on our way again tomorrow morning.""
Red looked at her, his face filled with a mixture of anger and disappointment. ""We don't have time to argue,"" he said. He reached down and pulled her into his arms. Maddy tried to pull away, but Red wouldn't let go.
""You're so strong, Maddy. I know you can do it,"" he whispered. ""Just keep your eyes on me."" He pushed his head into hers and then stood up, pulling her with him.
""What are you doing?"" asked Maddy. She pulled herself back, but Red kept his grip firmly on her wrist and began walking quickly down the trail.
""You're strong and you have to remember that,"" he said, his voice low.",1221,0.3574708856009709,-0.9806479087453712,-0.8214940030024821,0.29801268748915904,-1.5588508071632179
155,R_p3pQzIRix3EvWtH,BAS_HR_10,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He couldn't help but stare as she ate from the bowl that had been placed on the table before her. It wasn't just because she looked so beautiful—though she did, with long black hair and eyes that were green enough to make him think of spring leaves. No, it was more than that; there was something about her that made him want to know everything about her. But when he finally got up the nerve to ask if she wanted anything else, she turned away and left without saying a word.
He hadn't seen her since then, though he often thought about her. And now here she was again, sitting at another table in the same tavern, this time eating alone. She seemed different somehow, though he couldn't say exactly what it was. The way she carried herself, perhaps? Or maybe it was how she held herself, as if she were afraid someone would see her. That was why he kept his distance, watching from afar.
She finished her meal quickly and rose to leave. As soon as she stood up, he hurried over to her table. ""Excuse me,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I didn't get your name.""
""It's not important,"" she replied curtly.
""Well, if you don't mind my asking...?""
Her expression softened slightly. ""My name is Aella,"" she told him. Her voice was soft and sweet, and he could tell right away that she was a woman who knew how to use it.
""Aella,"" he repeated. ""That's an unusual name.""
""Not really,"" she said. ""There are many people named Aella in the city, including myself.""
""How interesting,"" he murmured. Then he leaned forward and whispered, ""If you're ever in need of a friend, you can always count on me. I'll be happy to talk with you anytime.""
She smiled at him and nodded. ""Thank you for your kind offer, but I have no need for friends. My life has been very lonely, after all.""
He felt terrible. What must she be going through? How sad! He wanted to take her by the hand and lead her out of the tavern, but he resisted the urge. Instead, he took her arm gently in his own and led her outside.
""You seem troubled,"" he remarked. ""Would you like some company until you feel better?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Why would you do such a thing?""
""Because I want to,"" he answered simply.
""But why?"" she asked. ""What good will it do?""
""Perhaps nothing. Perhaps a great deal,"" he replied. ""I'm just trying to show you that you aren't alone anymore.""
She stared at him for a moment, then smiled and said, ""Thank you. You've helped me a lot today.""
As they walked down the street together, she suddenly stopped in front of a shop window. There was something inside that caught her attention. ""Look!"" she exclaimed excitedly. ""Isn't this pretty?""
He followed her gaze and saw a pair of earrings in the display case. They were silver and shaped like flowers. ""Yes, they are,"" he agreed. ""They look lovely on you.""
""Oh, thank you!"" she gushed. ""This is my birthday present from my mother. I haven't even had a chance to wear them yet.""
""Then let me give you mine instead,"" he said. ""After all, I already have two pairs of earrings, and I rarely wear either of them. This way, you can have both.""
""Really?"" she asked, looking pleased.
""Of course. Now, shall we go back to the tavern?""
""Good idea,"" she replied.
Back at the tavern, she put on the earrings, and he admired their beauty. ""These are gorgeous,"" he said. ""Wherever did you find them?""
""At this shop,"" she replied. ""Do you know it?""
""No, I don't,"" he admitted.
""It's called 'The Flower Shop,' and it's located near the market square. I think you'd enjoy visiting it sometime.""
""I'd love to,"" he said. ""Maybe next week, if you're free.""
""Great! I'll meet you there.""
And so, every day after work, he went to the flower shop with her. Sometimes they talked about the weather or the latest news in the city. Other times they simply enjoyed each other's company.
One evening, she mentioned that her birthday was coming up. ""Have you decided what you're going to get for your gift?"" he asked.
""No, I haven't,"" she confessed. ""But I know what I want. I want a man who loves me.""
""I can't promise you that,"" he told her. ""But I can try to help you find him.""
""You mean you'll introduce us?"" she asked eagerly.
""Yes, I suppose I will,"" he replied. ""If he seems like someone you might like, I'll bring him to the tavern one night. If you approve, I'll ask him to join our little group.""
""That sounds wonderful!"" she exclaimed. ""Will you do that for me?""
""Of course,"" he assured her. ""Now, what should I call him? Do you have any suggestions?""
""His name is Cade,"" she said. ""Cade, this is Aella.""
""Pleased to meet you,"" he replied.
""Likewise,"" she responded. ""I hope you'll come visit me again soon.""
""I will,"" he promised. ""In fact, I'll see you tomorrow night.""
When she left, he sat at the table for a while, thinking. He hadn't expected things to turn out quite this way, but he liked it very much indeed.
He returned to the tavern and found his friends gathered around the table. ""Did you hear the news?"" he asked.
""What news?"" asked one of them.
""Aella and Cade are getting married!""
""Who's marrying whom?"" asked another.
""Don't you know?"" asked the first. ""They're engaged!""
""Engaged?"" gasped the second. ""Are you sure?""
""Yes, I'm sure!"" he answered. ""Aella told me herself.""
""So, when's the wedding?"" the third asked.
""Tomorrow afternoon,"" he replied. ""She wants to celebrate tonight.""
Everyone cheered. ""We'll have to throw her a party!""",1009,-0.0716777609980525,-1.1765875701454922,0.10663359806464641,1.2943971103861598,1.368117226346526
156,R_1PZCOHvF5i5D6gv,BAS_HSF_7,Hard Sci-Fi,Basic Coherence,Community,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature was still cool, but not nearly as cold as it had been when I arrived three months ago.
The president's office was located near the center of town, so I walked there quickly. When I reached the front door, however, I found it locked. A sign next to the door read ""Closed for Lunch"". I sighed and turned around to walk back home. Then something caught my eye: a small plaque just inside the entrance. It read simply, ""This is where we started.""
A smile crossed my face. This was exactly what I needed right now. Curiosity got the best of me, and I decided to take a quick peek inside. As soon as I entered, I realized why the president had wanted us all to come together. There were several dozen people sitting quietly in chairs arranged in rows facing a large screen mounted on one wall. Each person wore a headset that allowed them to hear the conversation taking place behind the closed doors. Most of these headsets also displayed text along the bottom of their screens. These words were being translated by computer software running on each individual's personal device.
As I stood there watching, President Koshō appeared on the screen. She looked tired, but she smiled warmly at everyone in the room. ""Thank you for coming today,"" she began. ""We've made some important progress recently, and I'd like to share it with you.""
She then launched into a detailed explanation about our recent discoveries regarding the origin of life on Earth. Everyone listened intently as she explained how scientists had finally discovered the source of the organic compounds that had built up over millions of years, forming the basis of every living thing on the planet. They had found evidence of the same chemicals on Mars, which meant that they must have been brought here from somewhere else. The most exciting discovery, though, came when she revealed that the same chemical processes that led to life on Earth could be used to create life itself. We would only need to find the right raw materials and set things in motion.
""What does this mean?"" someone asked.
""It means that we can begin creating new life forms here on Mars,"" replied the president. ""But first, we will need to do some more research. Our scientists are working hard to discover the exact conditions required for the process to work. Once we know those details, we'll start making preparations to send samples back to Earth. By the time we're finished, we should be able to grow any kind of plant or animal we want.""
There were cheers throughout the room as people celebrated this achievement. I felt proud to be part of such a forward-thinking organization. But I couldn't help but wonder if we had gone too far. If we succeeded in growing a whole ecosystem here on Mars, would it eventually lead to the extinction of the human race?
I knew that I wouldn't be staying long after the announcement. I didn't belong here anymore. I had left Earth because I wanted to explore the universe, not live inside a box. I walked out of the meeting hall and headed straight for the shuttle terminal.
""Where are you going?"" asked a man standing nearby. He was wearing a dark suit and had short black hair.
""To get off the planet,"" I answered.
""Why?"" he asked. ""Is there something wrong with your job?""
""No, but I'm done. I don't want to spend the rest of my life on Mars.""
""That's understandable. You've probably seen enough of the surface to last a lifetime.""
""Not really. I haven't even gotten to the core yet.""
The man laughed. ""You sound like a real adventurer.""
""Yeah, well, I am. I've traveled to a lot of places, but I've never been to the core of a planet. That's what I want to see next.""
""Well, good luck finding a way to get there. I doubt anyone has ever tried before.""
""Maybe not, but I've got a feeling that I'm going to figure it out.""
""Good luck to you, then. I hope you find what you're looking for.""
I boarded the shuttle and took a seat. As the vehicle lifted off the ground, I stared down at the Martian landscape below. It was beautiful, and I knew that someday I would return to visit it again. For now, though, I was ready to leave this world behind.

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The sky was blue and clear above the city as I made my way to the city center.
My mind was already thinking about what we'd do once we got to the office of President Morgan. We were going to tell him everything we knew about the situation on Mars, how much he'd lost because of our actions, and how badly he needed to change things. After that, we were going to show him just how to go about doing that. It was only a matter of time before the people of Mars had to rebel against Earth to get back their lives and independence. The president needed to know this if he wanted any chance of saving his planet, but there were two major obstacles standing between us and this meeting: First, I wasn't sure he would even believe us, and second, I wasn't exactly sure what I'd say to convince him that we weren't lying when we told him that.
I was beginning to suspect that our chances of getting through to him weren't good. Not after the events that had taken place over the last few days. I really hoped that we could convince him somehow to help us put a stop to this before things got out of hand. If not, we were going to have to take action on our own, but if we did, it could very well end up costing him his entire government. I couldn't imagine what the consequences for him would be. Maybe we should tell him instead that the United States has declared war on the people of Mars, since they didn't seem to care about anything except how much money they could make from their investments.
My thoughts were interrupted by my phone ringing. It was another call from the president's office asking me to come right away. I answered with a bit of irritation in my voice, and then said, ""I'm on my way,"" into the receiver before hanging up. It didn't take me long to get back to the city center, and when I arrived at the president's building, I found that Dr. Sato wasn't the only person waiting for me.
""Good news?"" I asked as I approached. ""Was I called here to give you an update on your plan or are we actually going to meet with the president today?""
""What do you think, David?"" replied the woman with the blonde hair and brown eyes. She was sitting on a couch in one of the waiting rooms, dressed in her usual white lab coat.
""You know, I can't believe you didn't tell me about this until now. What the hell happened?""
""We went back to check out the facility last night,"" she explained while taking off her glasses and rubbing her eyes. ""There were some guards there, but fortunately, we had an entire army of drones waiting for us.""
""The military has been tracking down and neutralizing every drone that we've launched,"" added the man. He had short-cut black hair with a goatee, and he wore his dark blue suit almost too perfectly. I hadn't seen either of them in person before, so I hadn't realized how much they looked alike.
""It appears that our soldiers have a pretty big lead on everyone else, because we didn't encounter anyone who was trying to stop us,"" continued the woman.
""Any luck on finding out what the hell is going on in there?""
""Not really,"" admitted the woman. ""The place is pretty well-guarded, and it's made to keep anyone from getting out alive.""
""And there aren't any signs that they've started a nuclear war on Mars yet,"" I added as an afterthought.
""So, then what are we supposed to do? We can't exactly storm the place in hopes of capturing their leader, or whatever he may be,"" said the man with the goatee.
""Well, we need to find out more about what's inside that building if we're going to have a chance of saving our planet,"" I responded, starting to get angry that Dr. Sato hadn't told me any of this before.
""The only way I can think of is to break into the facility,"" suggested the blonde woman. ""I can call in a few favors and try to find out which level they're keeping the prisoners at and get you some help.""
""What about security? There were a lot of them there yesterday,"" I asked.
""I'm sure I can come up with a plan,"" she answered with a grin. ""We don't know what those creatures are capable of. I want to find out if they could be a threat to us before we do anything.""
""It seems like we'll need more than just one person if we're going to do this,"" said the man. ""Who else is available?""
""Do you really think you can get all of us in there at once?"" asked the blonde woman. ""That's quite a big task.""
""I'd need two,"" she replied confidently. ""One to go in, and another to stay with you and make sure you don't get killed.""
""You and me,"" I said without hesitation. ""We should go together so that we can protect each other if something happens.""
""Two's fine with me,"" the man added as he stood up. ""Let's do this.""
""Okay, then we'll leave today,"" the woman continued. ""We have to start planning our strategy.""
""Sounds good to me,"" said the man as he began walking towards the exit. ""I've been dying to put those guards in their place.""
As he passed by, I turned and asked him, ""So, who are you? I keep hearing your name everywhere. I mean, you and Dr. Sato seem pretty well known around here.""
""Yeah, I guess I'm sort of famous now, or infamous depending on how you look at it,"" he replied with a laugh. ""It's kind of hard to explain, but I'm going to see him shortly, so we can talk about it then. What I can tell you for now is that I work for a very important group called 'The Coalition.'""
""But that doesn't really answer my question,"" I said. ""I still don't know who you are. Are you an astronaut, a soldier, an engineer? Or are you just some rich guy like Dr. Sato?""
""Actually, I'm all of those things, though I'd have to say that the first thing you mentioned is probably closest to the truth,"" answered the man with a wink. ""My real name isn't important right now. My real job title is 'Head of Security' for The Coalition.""
""So, what about you? Do you have a name?"" asked the blonde woman as she stood up from where she was sitting on the couch.
""Of course I do,"" I said, looking her straight in the eyes. ""I'm David Smith.""
""I've heard of you,"" said the man.
""We've been waiting for you, David,"" added the woman. ""Come with us.""
I followed them into another waiting room, where two more people were already waiting for me.
""I didn't think I would be seeing you again so soon, Dr. Sato,"" said the second one. He was a short bald man with an odd accent and a scar that ran from his ear all the way down to his chin.",1273,0.898987611607495,1.8199445633736444,0.16368823486812986,1.1793124680068068,0.8977442787407355
158,R_3KVZhmegLXQWLGo,MOR_HR_2,Historical Romance,Morpho,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The first thing he noticed was how beautiful she was. She was dressed in a long, flowing dress that clung to every curve of her body. It wasn't the dress that drew his attention, though. It was the look in her eyes that made him want to throw caution to the wind, walk over to her table, and kiss her until she gasped for air.
He didn't know then that her beauty had its own price.
He was from a village in Wales and had traveled to the city of Cardiff to look for work. His cousin had heard about a good job with a local family who were seeking a groom for their daughter. At first, he'd been excited about the prospect of working for the wealthy family, but when he'd arrived in Cardiff and seen the girl, he knew he'd never be able to do it. She was too beautiful.
He was an only child, and his parents had died when he was in his teens. He'd been left with nothing but the clothes on his back, and he'd had to become a servant to survive. He'd worked in many places, but he'd never come across another girl like her. She was like a vision from heaven, and he knew she would be the death of him.
She became his obsession. He wanted nothing more than to spend time with her, but he knew if he did that, he'd be thrown out of the house. He couldn't bear it when they would speak to each other and then turn their backs on him. He knew they thought him as lowly as he thought himself, and that was why he did what he did.
He'd become a thief. He'd steal anything that wasn't nailed down so he could sell it and feed himself. He never took anything from people who were better off than him, but he took from those who were less fortunate than him so they wouldn't have to go hungry. The only person who ever said anything to him about it was the innkeeper who owned the tavern where he worked. She didn't say anything about what he did, but she just kept an eye on him and made sure he got paid on time.
The first time she saw him stealing from outside her house, she'd thought it was a miracle. She'd always thought there wasn't any God because how could there be a God in a world that was so cruel? How could He allow children like her to live in such terrible poverty? Her mother had died giving birth to her baby brother, and her father had sold his small plot of land for a pittance so they could survive. No one had ever helped her or her brother, and she knew there was no way she could ever be as rich as the people in the village who owned their own houses and had food for their families.
Then she saw him stealing from outside her house. It was as if an angel had descended from heaven to help her. She knew she couldn't let him get away with stealing from her, so she chased after him and caught up with him just as he was about to enter the tavern where she worked.
""You are going to stop stealing from me,"" she'd snapped at him. ""You are going to bring me everything you take.""
He didn't even stop to think about what she said before he nodded at her and said, ""Yes, my lady.""
She watched as his eyes grew wide with shock at what she'd just said. She didn't know what possessed her to do it, but she just couldn't stop herself from saying whatever came into her mind. ""I am your lady now,"" she said in a voice that was low and husky. ""You are going to bring me everything you steal.""
He stared at her, wondering what she meant by what she said. Was she trying to get rid of him? Was she telling him off? He wasn't sure how to take it, but something about her made him think that she wasn't telling him off; instead, she wanted him to do whatever she wanted him to do. What did it matter anyway? He knew he would do whatever she asked of him. It didn't matter if it meant bringing back things that weren't worth anything to anyone else just so he could eat and look after his family again.
The next day when he returned with all the things that weren't nailed down, she asked him why he thought it was okay for him to steal from her when she was poor? He tried to explain that he didn't steal things for himself, but for his family because they couldn't afford them otherwise. She knew that already because they were poor too, but there was something in the way he spoke that made her want to believe him even though she hadn't spoken to anyone else in the village about how poor they were or even how bad their situation was. She had never told anyone else because it would break their hearts if they knew how bad it really was for them; no one wanted that kind of heartache in their lives.
She nodded at him and smiled at him as if what he'd said was enough to convince her of his good intentions. That's when she made him swear that there would be no more stealing from her or anyone else in the village or there would be hell to pay for both of them. He didn't know why she made him swear on his mother's grave; it just felt right to do it that way so he did what she asked of him without question.
The next time he stole from someone else in the village, she chased after him and caught up with him just as before except this time as soon as she caught up with him, she pushed him into a ditch and tied his hands together until someone came along and freed him from his bonds and took him home.
The next day when he returned with all the things that weren't nailed down, she asked him why he thought it was okay for him to steal from someone else when her family needed things too? This time, however, when he tried to explain himself, instead of pushing him into a ditch, she kissed him and made love with him right there in front of everyone who lived in the village who had gathered to watch them have sex against a wall on the side of the road where they lived. Everyone cheered them on and laughed at how much fun they were having doing it right there on public display for everyone to see.",1181,-0.4929103892276196,1.240531736029599,0.4207032960576277,-1.109702715965965,0.6880431689588196
159,R_79AzqGkjKKn257r,FAN_HF_3,High Fantasy,Fandango,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It must have been built in the last few months,"" said Elina. She pointed to two wooden poles that had been pushed into the ground as if to mark the location of some long-forgotten village. The river was low enough to wade across. ""I'm surprised anyone would choose to live here.""
""They probably came because it was the closest place to take shelter during these storms,"" he replied.
He followed her gaze as she stared down into the shallow water. ""I wonder what happened to them?""
She was quiet for a moment, then gave him an understanding nod. ""I can understand your wanting to go down there to see... what's left of them.""
""I don't think I'll find anything, Elina. It looks as though it has been abandoned long ago.""
""I would like you to come anyway. Just so we know, yes?""
He nodded, and she put her hand on his arm and together they made their way across the river. They walked quietly past the village, making sure not to make a sound until they were well on their way back the way they had come.
""There are several buildings over there,"" said Elina, pointing to one of the towers.
Sasha took her hand again to steady himself, then nodded. ""I remember seeing that. That would be the keep. You could tell by the roof.""
""And that one over there,"" she added, motioning toward another building, ""is where the villagers lived.""
""There're a lot more people than I thought would have lived there.""
Elina shrugged. ""It's not like there's much else to do around here. Besides, it wasn't exactly a thriving community; only about twenty souls lived there.""
""I'm still amazed they managed to build this place in such a remote location,"" Sasha said as they continued to walk in silence between the towers. The valley was lush and green, filled with plants that he didn't recognize, but he'd never been anywhere near this part of the world before. He hadn't even known that villages existed at all here along the River Tethys.
""I'm not so sure we should be exploring down there, Sasha,"" Elina said when he stopped, turning to look at him.
Sasha turned back toward the valley. ""I thought you wanted to see what was down there? I would have gone by myself had it meant we would have to leave right away.""
She shook her head. ""No, that's not what I mean. It's just that..."" She looked around, then motioned toward one of the towers. ""That's where the villagers would have gone to hide from the storms, right?""
Sasha nodded. ""Yes. I'm sure of it.""
""Well, then I suppose it won't hurt to check it out. At least we might get a better idea of what happened to them."" She stepped away from him, then began to pick her way down into the valley.
Sasha quickly followed, and they walked along the edge of the river for a few minutes before Elina stopped and looked around, trying to figure out where exactly the settlement had once stood. As far as he could tell, they were alone. No movement or signs of any other living creature. He glanced down at his hand, finding it shaking slightly from the cold.
""Are you scared?"" she asked, noticing his reaction.
Sasha shook his head. ""Not particularly. If you are.""
Elina let out a laugh. ""I'm not. I want to see what happened to our people.""
""I'm not going to go down there, Elina.""
""You don't have to, Sasha. I'm doing fine without you.""
Before he could respond, she had disappeared into the thick vegetation, and Sasha watched her as she slowly moved deeper into the valley. When he was certain that she would not return anytime soon, he went over to the nearest tower and climbed up onto the roof. From there, he could follow her movements with ease.
After about ten minutes of searching, Elina finally stopped and turned to face him. She had reached a walled enclosure that he assumed was once a large house. A massive tree had grown in front of it, and branches covered the walls and roof.
""I thought this was where the villagers would have built their shelter,"" said Sasha, walking forward and looking down into the clearing around the tree.
""You're not wrong,"" Elina replied. ""Look at those roots. They must have brought it here to protect themselves.""
""What's inside?"" asked Sasha.
Elina stepped through the opening and began to make her way into the darkness inside. Before he could follow, she paused. ""Do you hear that? It sounds like...""
Sasha listened intently, but all he could hear was the river flowing. He heard no other noises.
""It's nothing,"" she said after a few moments. She went deeper into the house and returned a minute later.
""I found a chest in one of the rooms,"" she said.
""A chest?""
""Yes. But it's locked.""
Sasha frowned. ""Didn't they leave behind any keys?""
""They did. There was one hanging on the wall over there."" She pointed to the opposite wall of the room, and Sasha could see what appeared to be a key leaning against the wood. The only problem was that there was something else blocking it.
""Can you reach it?"" Sasha asked.
""I don't think so,"" she replied, and the smile that crossed her lips at his question told him that she was teasing him.
""Why am I not surprised? Let me give it a try. You're too short.""
Elina rolled her eyes but didn't say anything as he went over to the key and pulled it closer to him. It was a simple hook, and only two feet long, but just as he was about to grab hold of it, he realized he didn't have enough length to reach it.
""You're right,"" he said, reaching toward her again. ""We need to use your spear to reach it.""
Elina laughed. ""That would be fun.""
""Let's hope they left us something for protection against the monsters."" Sasha took a deep breath and stretched his arms straight out as he tried to reach the key. ""Come on, Elina. Help me stretch.""
""You're not serious?""
Sasha smiled. ""I've always been serious.""
He reached up for the key with all his strength and was about to snatch it from the wall when an arm snaked around his shoulder and clamped down tightly.
""What are you doing?"" she asked as he stumbled backward, nearly falling.
""I was trying to reach the key.""
""I saw what you were doing,"" she replied, grabbing his hair and jerking his head back before he could turn to face her.",1183,0.55873224076726,0.5846340764670822,-0.944381844285119,-1.715744398323194,-1.2958514870281956

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The sun shone down like a golden orb, lighting up the blue-green clouds. They were low enough to see now that the spring had finally arrived. I looked back at my apartment, which was situated at the very top of one of the tallest buildings in downtown Athens. There wasn't much to look at there besides my place and the other three units on the floor, but I'd lived there since my arrival two years ago and felt comfortable. I turned to go down the stairs when a sudden thought hit me.
""Sato! What do you mean the president wants us to meet with him? Is he going to tell us something new about this mission?"" I asked as soon as I reached the ground floor.
She gave me a confused look. ""The president doesn't want to tell you anything. He wants you to be surprised.""
""That's not very reassuring,"" I replied. ""And what does he think is going to surprise us?""
""You'll see. Just make sure you're there on time."" She headed back toward her car.
I made my way through the crowds on the streets to the parking garage where my rover was parked. It was still early for the rush hour traffic, so it wasn't too hard to get out of the garage and onto the road. The rover took off smoothly as soon as I started driving, heading east toward the city center. The roads were wide here on Mars, and there was no need for lane markers or traffic lights. Instead, there were large yellow lines painted down the middle of each road, separating the lanes into sections. I drove at a steady pace, keeping an eye on the road ahead and scanning the sky. I didn't have to look far to spot the first signs of spring—a flock of birds flying in a V formation, and a single bright red flower growing on the side of a small hill. As I approached the city center, I saw the government buildings on the left, and then the massive white dome of the UN building on the right. The sun glittered off its curved surface, which reflected the light of the midday sun. It was a sight that never failed to impress me.
""Welcome to Athens,"" I said as I pulled into the parking garage of the government complex. The guards recognized me and waved me through, letting me into a secured parking area reserved for government officials. A security officer came over to check my ID. He scanned it and handed it back before waving me inside. I parked and walked across the foyer to the main reception area. It was a large open space with tall glass windows looking out into the city. A couple of people were sitting behind the counter, and they stood up as I approached. One of them was Sato, who greeted me with a warm smile.
""Hello, Takahashi-san,"" she said. ""Are you ready?""
I nodded as I looked around. ""As always,"" I replied.
She led me past the waiting room and down a long hallway. At the end of the hallway was a door, which was closed. We stopped outside and waited until a woman dressed in a dark blue suit opened it. She looked at us before nodding to Sato and walking away. Sato turned to me.
""We'll be leaving from the president's office,"" she said.
""So, he doesn't want to talk to me?"" I asked.
""He wants to talk to everyone,"" she answered. ""You're one of his most trusted advisors.""
The woman led us into an elevator and up to the top floor, where the president's office was located. As soon as we stepped off, she led us to a private meeting room and left us alone. We sat down and looked around. There were two men standing by the window, looking out at the city. They smiled when they saw Sato enter the room. I followed her gaze and saw the president sitting on a leather chair behind the desk, flanked by two women in business suits. The president waved to us before turning his attention back to the window. He was tall and wore a black suit. His skin was dark, like mine, but there was something different about him—a hint of a beard and a pair of thick glasses resting on his nose. It took me a second to recognize that this was the man who had been elected to be president of the UN.
""Takahashi-san, please take a seat,"" he said.
Sato and I sat down, and the two men moved to stand behind us. They placed their hands on our shoulders as if we were children being shown to their seats for the first time. The president walked over to a table in the middle of the room and poured himself a glass of water before taking a seat. He sat down with his feet stretched out in front of him and smiled at us.
""Thank you for coming, Takahashi-san,"" he said. ""I know how busy you are, so I appreciate you taking the time to meet with us.""
I nodded. ""Of course, Mr. President. It's an honor to have been asked to come here today. I hope I can help.""
""As do I,"" he replied. He took a sip from his glass and looked at Sato. ""Please tell me what you want me to know.""
Sato gave me a curious glance before starting to speak. She told him everything that had happened since the last time we'd spoken. About the incident with the Chinese ships and the discovery of the alien artifacts, as well as the recent discovery of a new artifact deep beneath the ice on Pluto. By the time she finished, I could see the president's face was dark with worry.
""So, this is all connected?"" he asked. ""All these incidents? They're related somehow?""
Sato nodded. ""It's possible they're all connected, yes.""
The president leaned back in his chair and rubbed his forehead. ""I've got some bad news for you, Takahashi-san,"" he said.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""Your mission will not be ending when it's supposed to.""
I looked at him in surprise. ""How can you say that?"" I asked. ""We've already completed all our objectives! We found the alien artifacts, and we returned to Earth without a single problem. We even came back ahead of schedule!""
""But that wasn't the point of your mission, was it?"" he answered. ""You were sent out to find evidence of extraterrestrial life, and that's exactly what you did.""
I shook my head. ""That's not what we were tasked to do. You said yourself that there's nothing in the reports that says we need to bring back any samples or data. We just have to come back.""
He took another sip of water and looked at me.",1206,1.9078811539399707,2.1071553127652933,0.13492314080187018,1.7567099004645796,1.7802284769696204

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The president had been very busy since our arrival. He'd held press conferences every other day to talk about what was going on in the city, as well as what was being done to get things back up and running again. The Martian government had declared a state of emergency after the attack by the Chinese, which meant that all nonessential personnel were sent home and the military was called in to help clean up the mess. As a result, there weren't many people around. Most of the residents who hadn't evacuated had gone into hiding until things settled down. There wasn't much else they could do anyway.
My first stop was the café where I worked part time. My boss, Mr. Koshikawa, had left instructions for me to go straight there after leaving Dr. Sato's house. When I got inside, he was sitting behind the counter reading through a stack of papers while sipping some coffee. He looked up when I came in, smiled, and then gestured toward one of the tables.
""Sit down, Kenji,"" he said. ""You look like you're in a hurry.""
""Sorry, Mr. Koshikawa,"" I replied. ""I've got something important to take care of today.""
Mr. Koshikawa nodded and returned to his paperwork. I sat down at the table and opened the envelope. Inside was a note written by the president himself.
Dear Kenji,
Thank you for your hard work during the crisis. You are doing a great job in helping us rebuild the city and get everything back to normal. I want to thank you personally for your efforts. If you would please come see me this afternoon, I will be more than happy to reward you for them.
Yours truly,
President John F. Kennedy
I folded the note up and put it away before standing up to leave. Mr. Koshikawa gave me a smile and said, ""Have fun!""
It didn't take me long to walk to the president's office. Once I arrived, I went inside and handed over my ID card to the guard at the entrance. Then I walked past him and entered the main room. A man wearing a dark suit stood next to the president's desk. He was holding a tablet computer in front of him, but turned to face me when I approached.
""Kenji?"" asked the man. His name tag read ""John Smith"".
""Yes, sir,"" I said.
Smith glanced at the president and then motioned toward me. ""Please wait here for a moment. We'll let you know if the president is ready to see you.""
I nodded and waited for him to return. After a few minutes, he reappeared and told me to follow him. He led me into another room and pointed at a chair. I sat down and watched as he spoke with someone on the other side of the glass window. They were speaking English, so I couldn't understand most of what they were saying. Finally, the man nodded and left.
A minute later, President Kennedy came in. He was wearing a blue suit and tie, along with a white shirt. He looked just like any other American politician you might see on television.
""Hello, Kenji,"" he said. ""How are you?""
""Fine, sir,"" I replied. ""And yourself?""
Kennedy shook his head. ""Not good. Not good at all.""
We both fell silent for a moment. I didn't know how to respond to that, so I decided to change the subject.
""What can I do for you, sir?"" I asked.
""Well, I wanted to ask you to join my cabinet,"" said Kennedy. ""I need someone to lead the reconstruction effort.""
I blinked several times. ""Sir, I'm not sure that's possible,"" I replied. ""I don't think I have the experience or qualifications for that sort of position.""
""Don't worry about that, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""This isn't a political appointment. You won't be answering to anyone but myself. This is strictly volunteer work. All I want you to do is help me rebuild the city. That's it. Nothing more. Is that okay with you?""
I hesitated for a moment. I liked working for Mr. Koshikawa, and I didn't really want to give that up. But at the same time, I knew I had to accept the offer if I wanted to keep living here.
""Yes, sir,"" I finally replied. ""If you think I can help, then I guess I should do it.""
""Good,"" said Kennedy. ""Now, I'll tell you what I've been thinking about. First, I want to make sure everyone knows we're safe again. So, I've ordered the military to start patrolling the streets. They'll be keeping watch over the city 24/7. Second, we're going to have to rebuild the power grid. I'm sending a team of engineers to figure out how to do that. Third, I want to build new housing for the homeless. And lastly, I want to find ways to bring in money. I'm going to have to call a special session of congress to discuss the situation. Hopefully, they'll pass legislation to allow us to sell off some of the land. Once that happens, I plan to use the money to rebuild the city.""
""Sounds like a lot to deal with, sir,"" I said.
""That's why I'm asking for your help, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""I want you to be my point man for all of these projects. You can handle it, right?""
I thought about it for a second. I did feel confident in my ability to manage the reconstruction project, but I wasn't sure I was cut out for the rest of what he was talking about.
""I guess I can try,"" I said. ""But I still don't think I have enough experience for this kind of thing.""
""Don't worry about that,"" said Kennedy. ""I don't expect you to know everything. Just do the best you can. That's all I ask. Okay?""
I nodded. ""Okay, sir.""
""Great,"" said Kennedy. ""Then let's get started. Let's go talk to Mr. Koshikawa.""
He led me back into the main room, where I saw Mr. Koshikawa standing next to the door. The president introduced me to him, and then the three of us headed outside.
""So, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""What do you think? Can you handle the reconstruction project?""
""I don't know yet, sir,"" I replied. ""I haven't had a chance to study the details yet.""",1119,2.0592373864227866,1.5566918304091406,-0.0851789277475556,0.207606716295154,1.8112589966413246
162,R_3IabOoreD8ORE0p,BAS_HR_2,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Community,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He hadn't been able to take his eyes off her. The way she moved with such confidence made it clear that she knew exactly who she was. And what she wanted.
He watched as she ordered drinks from the barkeep, then took them over to her table. She didn't seem to care that anyone could see her. Her long red hair fell down her back, framing an exquisite face. A face that seemed to be carved out of marble. She had full lips, high cheekbones, and large blue eyes that sparkled when she laughed.
She wore a simple dress, but it was cut low enough so that he could make out the swell of her breasts beneath the fabric. When she turned to look around the room, he caught a glimpse of the curve of her hips. It was all he could do not to stare.
But when she looked up at him, he found himself staring right back into those sparkling blue eyes. They were mesmerizing. As if they held some kind of spell that would compel him to stay there forever.
""You're staring,"" she said, smiling sweetly.
His heart nearly stopped beating. ""I'm sorry.""
""Don't apologize. I like it. You should do it more often.""
It was only after she left that he realized he'd never seen her before. Not once. But he couldn't get her out of his mind. His body ached for hers. Every night since then, he dreamed about her. Dreamed about making love to her. Only, in his dreams, she wasn't as beautiful or as confident as she really was. In his dream, she was just a girl. A young woman who needed someone to protect her. To cherish her.
And that's why he was here now. That's why he was going to marry this strange girl. Because he wanted to keep her safe.
He walked up behind her chair and leaned over her shoulder. ""Hello, my lady.""
Her head snapped around and she gasped. Then she smiled and pushed herself away from the table.
""Good morning, Your Highness.""
She curtsied again. ""Your Highness?""
""Yes. My name is Prince Rolf. I am your husband.""
She stared at him, stunned. ""What? How did you—I mean, we haven't even—""
He put his hand on her arm. ""Please don't worry yourself, my dear. We have plenty of time to talk about that later. For now, let me introduce myself properly. My name is Rolf, and I will be taking care of you from this day forward. Do you understand?""
""Of course, Your Highness.""
He grinned. ""Then please call me Rolf.""
She nodded. ""Rolf. Thank you. Now, tell me your name.""
""My name is Nila, Your Highness. What's yours?""
""My name is Rolf. Please call me Rolf.""
She giggled. ""That sounds silly. Why can't I call you by your real name?""
He shrugged. ""Because no one calls me by my real name. No one except my family, and they're not here. So I thought it would be easier if everyone called me Rolf.""
She shook her head. ""No, Rolf. I think I'll stick with Nila.""
He grinned. ""All right, Nila. Shall we go home?""
She nodded, and they walked out of the tavern together.
Once outside, she glanced around. ""Where are we going?""
""To our new house. It's a small place, but very nice. I've already sent for some things to be brought over from the castle.""
""Oh! Is that where we live?""
He nodded. ""For now, yes. But eventually, I want us to move into the palace. I'm sure you'd like that, wouldn't you?""
She nodded. ""I would.""
""Well, then, let's get started. I want you to meet my mother and father today. And your brother, too.""
Nila frowned. ""Why do we need to meet your parents? Won't they come to visit us soon?""
""They probably will. But I want them to see how happy you make me. I also want to show them that I'm serious about marrying you. After all, I am a prince, and they are the king and queen of our country.""
She nodded. ""Okay. Let's go.""
As they walked along the street, she gazed up at him. ""So, Rolf, what is it that you do for a living?""
""I work in a tavern, actually. I help serve food and drinks to customers.""
""Oh, that must be fun.""
""Not really. It's hard work. But I enjoy being around people.""
""Do you know a lot of interesting stories?""
He chuckled. ""There are always plenty of funny ones to share. Have you heard any good jokes lately?""
""Just the other day, my friend told me a joke. It went something like this. 'A man walks into a bar. He sits down next to a woman and asks her if she wants to play a game.' She says, 'Sure.'""
""Did she say anything else?""
""No, but I bet she did.""
""What do you mean?""
""Well, I can imagine what she said. She probably asked him if he wanted to play a game. Like maybe poker. Or chess. Or darts. Something like that.""
He laughed. ""You're right, Nila. That's exactly what she said.""
""Can you tell me another one?""
He shook his head. ""Sorry, I don't have any others to share with you right now.""
She sighed. ""That's okay. I'll just wait until you hear a good joke sometime. Then you can tell it to me.""
""I promise I will.""
They reached their destination and Rolf opened the door. ""Come inside, my dear. I hope you like it.""
She stepped into the house. It was small, but clean and comfortable. There was a bed in one corner, and a chest of drawers beside it. A table and two chairs stood near the window.
""This is wonderful,"" she said. ""Thank you for letting me stay here.""
""It's no problem. I'm glad you like it.""
""Is there anything I can do to help?""
""No, my dear. I'm fine. I've got everything under control.""
She smiled. ""I believe you. I'll just go upstairs and unpack. Then I'll come back down to join you for dinner.""",1051,1.386269394424623,0.866295247526428,1.0424676596801936,-1.1460692296544197,1.0795705448682447
163,R_2y2bCFlJAEKyfAg,OUR_HOR_9,Horror,Ouroboros,Community,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The face seemed to be my own but with a dark, demonic aura. I could see his teeth through the open mouth that wasn't covered by skin. Then I realized this wasn't my reflection, this was someone else. It had to be my twin brother, but I didn't know how he'd gotten in here or why. I ran down the hall and started banging on doors. There was no answer. The house was eerily silent except for that voice. That terrible, inhuman voice. As I searched for answers, that terrible, inhuman face smiled at me. It began laughing at me. ""You're not going anywhere,"" it said.
""Shut up!"" I shouted. ""Who are you?"" I asked. He didn't answer, so I just continued looking around the room until something caught my eye. A box was sitting on top of the desk. I moved closer to get a better look and found letters inside the lid. I grabbed them all and tore them open. The first one read:
Dear brother,
I'm writing this letter from the other side. I don't think you'll ever make it there because the place we've been placed is too dangerous. You have to know how sorry I am for leaving you like this. I never wanted to do that to you but I felt I had no choice. You're probably wondering how I did it. I used our father's tools, of course. I used those to help me escape. I know you don't want to hear this right now, but I don't think you're going to make it back. Your mind will be consumed by the darkness that surrounds this place. I hope you can find peace, though. I know it won't be easy, but I believe in you.
Another note read:
I know how much you love your mom so I won't tell her about what I've done. I just don't see the point in doing that. She deserves to know, but she needs time to get over this. I don't even think she realizes what it means that you're gone. It was selfish of me to leave without warning her, but I needed to do it for you. Don't worry; she'll get over it.
The third one read:
I'm sorry for everything. I didn't expect to die when I tried to do what was right. I shouldn't have trusted the witch. There's so much I wish I could tell you. I think the most important thing would be how glad I am that you came here with me. You saved my life, and I know you didn't have to. I know you must have your reasons, but I want you to know I appreciate you for everything you've done. You're an amazing person. I think I told you that once before. It still applies.
The last letter read:
It's so good to finally be free. It took a lot of work, but I think it was all worth it. You were always so nice to me, but I think the best part is how you were willing to help me. I know it wasn't easy, but you did it anyway. I wish you could have seen me escape because you'd be proud. I don't want you to worry about me. I know you're probably scared right now. You should be, but just remember: no matter what happens, I'll always love you.
After reading those, I put down the letters and turned to see that demonic face in the mirror again. Then I heard the voice coming from behind me. ""You're not going anywhere,"" it said. I ran back to the box and grabbed the revolver that was lying next to it. The thing on the other side of the mirror smiled as it opened its mouth to talk again. It spoke: ""Do you know what it's like to be stuck in a place that you can never escape? It's the worst feeling ever! There's nothing worse than being trapped. That's why I want you to know that I'm going to kill you."" I placed my finger on the trigger and shot at the mirror. My bullet bounced off its surface.
Then the mirror shattered into a thousand pieces.
I sat there on the floor crying until someone knocked on the front door. I wiped my tears and ran to the foyer. I saw it was Mrs. Van Deuren. ""Oh, thank goodness,"" she said as I answered the door. ""Your father is gone. He left earlier this morning,"" I told her. She started crying. ""What happened?"" she asked. ""We lost him somewhere while he was hunting,"" I lied. ""Oh, no!"" she said. ""He won't like that."" I grabbed a few things from my room and headed for the front door. When I opened it, Mrs. Van Deuren was standing there with another woman. I had never seen her before. I didn't even know what she looked like. Mrs. Van Deuren introduced us. Her name was Mrs. Blunt. She took off running, but I just stood there, shocked.
""You'll never make it out of here alive,"" she said. I knew it wasn't Mrs. Van Deuren because she wasn't wearing the same dress. ""You're not going anywhere,"" Mrs. Blunt said again. Then, she took off running. I went after her, but I didn't want to kill her. I needed to find the witch first. Mrs. Van Deuren followed me out. We went inside. ""We should split up. That way we can cover more ground,"" I said.
""No, let's stay together,"" Mrs. Van Deuren insisted. We stayed in the kitchen. As Mrs. Van Deuren cooked, I took the opportunity to study her. There was something off about her, though. She seemed almost happy. She smiled when she made the toast. When I asked why, she told me that she'd finally found a family and that she wanted to protect them. That didn't make sense to me, so I questioned her.
She looked at me and said, ""I know what happened to your brother.""
I was stunned by her statement. I didn't know how she knew.
""How?"" I asked.
She looked at Mrs. Van Deuren and answered, ""Because we have a similar story. My son disappeared. He was gone for years, and I had no idea where he was."" She paused for a moment. ""Then he showed back up. The same as your brother: lost and alone,"" she continued. I was speechless.
Mrs. Van Deuren grabbed my arm and said, ""My mother and father left for the other side, too. They weren't supposed to do that. They were just supposed to stay on this side until you came. Now it's all messed up, and they can't find their way home. If they don't find the witch, they won't be able to come back.",1182,-1.4644887529576003,-0.9858021337805228,-0.6298042135074827,1.3727975909242638,-0.4278828552349107
164,R_SGEPb9NhN3IhW8h,OUR_HF_2,High Fantasy,Ouroboros,Community,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""A few more minutes."" Jaxi had been silent since she'd spoken during the ride. ""I'm still not certain that this is our destination, but I am getting closer. But we're here, so I'll stop trying."" She sank into silence again as they stopped the wagons beside a stream next to a small bridge. ""At least for now.""
""Well, what do you expect us to do?"" Ryl asked, taking several steps down onto the grassy bank. ""We're not exactly dressed for an outing into town.""
Jaxi's response was silence. They waited until it grew dark before continuing. Ryl could have used the power of the stones to see in the dark, but he didn't think the others would appreciate it too much if he walked around wearing them.
""It doesn't seem like anyone has noticed us,"" Yuliana said, looking up toward the towers. ""Hopefully we can just walk around the village and then head back."" She started moving forward.
Ryl shook his head and followed after her. As they made their way past a few homes, he took note of the people who passed by them. There were about three dozen that they saw while walking through the village. Most ignored them and kept going. A few gave the group curious looks but continued on their way without saying anything.
After about half an hour of wandering, they found what appeared to be the center of the town with an open area surrounded by several shops and buildings. The only one that seemed to be occupied was a store in front of the area. The owner was inside behind the counter. He stood and came out when Ryl and the others walked into the shop.
""Ah, you must be new in town."" The man wore a heavy cloak with the hood pulled up over his face. His eyes were hidden from view by the folds of his coat. ""You are welcome here. It's been a long time since there was anyone to visit the village, but we've managed to stay busy. I'm Gorgus. You can call me Gorgus, though most do shorten it to Gruc. Come in, come in. Can I get you something to eat or drink? There's a little bar back in the corner there if you'd like a cold ale.""
""We're not really looking for food or drink,"" Jaxi said. ""I'm more interested in learning about what has happened here and who lives here now.""
""I don't know anything about that."" Gorgus turned toward a cabinet behind him. ""There is some news. We have a few travelers that stopped in yesterday."" He turned back to them with a wooden tray in his hands. ""Would you like some bread, cheese, or smoked sausage?""
Ryl and Yuliana exchanged glances. They both shook their heads no. ""No, thank you,"" Ryl replied.
Gorgus laughed as he returned the tray to the cabinet. ""Not hungry?""
""Just a little peckish, that's all,"" Ryl replied, shaking his head.
""Well, there's something wrong if you're hungry after eating a whole dinner at the feast,"" Gorgus chuckled. ""I'll let you know about the travelers later then. If you'd like to see inside, there are a couple of chairs over by the fire if you want to take your time and talk. Or if you'd rather just sit outside and eat, I can bring out a couple of fresh-baked rolls. It's a lovely evening tonight. A little cooler than usual, but still good.""
""Do you mind if we eat and drink outside?"" Ryl asked, motioning for the others to follow him as he led them away from the shop and toward the front of the buildings.
""Of course not."" Gorgus smiled. ""I was going to do that anyway. The weather is nice, and I think you've probably earned a break from being cooped up in these wagons. I don't have a lot to offer, but my bread is always fresh.""
They settled onto a wooden bench in a small park on the edge of the village, taking a moment to take in the sounds and sights around them. The wind had picked up some since they'd arrived at the lake. The clouds had blown away, leaving only a few puffy white wisps dancing in the sky above the mountains. Ryl couldn't help but admire the view as the setting sun painted the mountains a vivid shade of gold. He felt Jaxi settle into the back of his head.
""That was a lot faster than I would have expected,"" Ryl said, smiling as he watched Yuliana pick off pieces of sausage and cheese and devour them in one bite.
""What do you mean?"" She looked up at him.
""Jaxi didn't take nearly this long to find what she wanted here.""
Yuliana shrugged as she chewed her food. ""There hasn't been much to discover. I've already spent hours searching every building in town for any mention of what has happened to the people here.""
""This place seems perfectly fine,"" Ryl said, taking a swig from the water skin he held in one hand. ""It looks like someone just left it all behind without telling anyone else.""
""I'm afraid that may not be the case,"" Gorgus said from a short distance away.
Ryl and the others turned to look at him. He walked over with a smile on his face, his hands tucked inside his sleeves.
""The people who lived here were slaughtered and their bodies disposed of by their own children. They thought they'd lost everything when a demon attacked the village. Their only hope of survival was to hide in a small cavern. It is here that they stayed for three days. When they emerged, there was nothing left of their home or the surrounding villages.""
""Why didn't we notice anything?"" Ryl asked. ""Or better yet, why did no one come back after that? There can't be so many people out in the world that could just leave behind a whole town without a word.""
Gorgus sighed as he leaned against the fence nearby. ""We have an infestation problem here. It has been happening for the past few years, but the demons are becoming more organized and aggressive now. They use whatever means necessary to kill their prey, so there is very little left after they've finished with it. The best way to fight them is to drive them out of a region before they can settle in. That is what the city guards in the city do when they aren't fighting other cities, so I expect that they will continue to try and keep these creatures from moving in, just as we're trying to do here. But we don't have much manpower. If something happens, then there is not enough left to help those that are caught by the demons.""
Yuliana nodded. ""It does explain why the people here seem to be gone though.",1220,1.9058310918413406,0.07873133933746822,-1.0519046358175979,0.6384087191205722,0.25847417771249254
165,R_2SuY0e0fr9JKYPa,GEN_HR_10,Historical Romance,Genesis,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been so busy, serving drinks to all the people who came by that she had startled him. His eyes hadn't left her as they'd talked for an hour or more about nothing. Finally he couldn't stand it any longer and blurted out how beautiful she was. Then he'd gone back to his work without even getting her name.
He wondered if she would be there tomorrow. The next day when he arrived with the beer, she wasn't seated at the table. But then three days later she was again sitting right in front of him, talking excitedly to herself. Her voice brought him up short; he looked down and noticed that she was wearing men's clothing, which fit her perfectly but didn't seem quite right on a woman.
A week after she started coming to the tavern, he learned why. A young man—a servant boy—who worked for the tavern owner had been found murdered and dumped under some bushes near an old graveyard. It appeared he'd been killed because he knew something important about the tavern's business and someone wanted to keep it secret. The tavern keeper was furious with him, blaming him for what happened to his boy. He threatened to fire the boy if he ever saw him again.
So now this woman—as he still thought of her—was visiting the tavern every single evening. She ate dinner with everyone else and stayed until closing time, then disappeared. No one asked her questions. They were too afraid of the tavern keeper and the trouble he could cause them if they did. So no one made any effort to find out anything about her. And after two weeks she stopped coming to the tavern altogether.
The next day, however, he saw her standing in the middle of the street, looking around. She seemed lost. That was odd; none of the other women who frequented the tavern wore men's clothing. He hurried over to her and called out, ""Are you all right?""
She turned toward him and stared, as though trying to focus on his face. When she finally realized he was speaking to her, she said softly, ""Yes. Thank you."" Then she continued to stare at him, as if not sure whether or not he really existed.
""Do you live nearby? Maybe I can help you find your way home,"" he offered tentatively.
Her eyes searched his face again, and this time she nodded. ""I am lost. I've never been here before. Please let me stay with you tonight.""
He didn't know what to do. Should he take her to his house? No, that was probably forbidden. If the tavern keeper caught them together, both of them would be fired from their jobs. But he didn't want to just leave her standing there, so he shrugged his shoulders helplessly. ""Well … I'll have to ask my father, but I'm sure we can find room for you.""
""Thank you,"" she murmured, then hurried off, leaving him to wonder what to do next.
But when he returned to the tavern the next day, it was obvious to him that his father already had a plan. Before he even entered the building, he heard his father's booming voice calling out, ""Cedric!""
He turned and ran toward the sound of his father's call. As he approached the door, Cedric heard his father say, ""Go get her.""
Cedric hesitated only a moment before hurrying away. He knew exactly where to find her—she'd been standing in the same spot outside the tavern ever since he'd seen her the previous night.
When he walked up to her, she looked startled. ""What are you doing here?"" she demanded angrily.
""My father told me to bring you inside,"" he replied, stepping forward to place his hand on the small of her back. ""You can stay with us tonight. You're welcome to stay here forever. We don't care.""
She stopped and stared at him. ""Why would anyone ever want to stay in a place like this?""
""Because we love it,"" he said simply.
""And you?"" she asked. ""Do you want to live with these people?""
""Of course I do! Why wouldn't I?"" he asked, surprised. ""This is my family, my home. This is where I belong.""
She looked up at him with those eyes that seared into him. For the second time that day, he felt his heart skip a beat.
""Did you hear what I said?"" she asked quietly. ""I'm staying with you tonight. My name is Greta.""
Then she took a deep breath, stepped past him and went inside the tavern.
Cedric watched her go in, wondering what to do next, and then followed her inside.
He was amazed. His father had done everything he possibly could to make her feel at home. Even though she was a stranger, they treated her as a member of the family. She sat down at the table where everyone always ate their meals, and his father said, ""Cedric, can you get me a chair from the kitchen?""
""Yes, Father,"" he answered, then hurried off to fetch a chair.
Greta had eaten her meal and was washing her dishes when he returned carrying the chair. She looked up at him and smiled. ""Thank you, Cedric. Would you like to join me?""
He blinked. ""Would I like to—?""
""Sit down and eat with us,"" she finished for him.
He set the chair down next to hers and sat down, but he barely touched his food. He kept staring at her, unable to believe that she was actually sitting with them.
She reached out and placed her hand on his arm. ""Don't be shy, Cedric. Eat your dinner.""
He looked at her hand, then slowly extended his own. She took it, and he felt warm and safe. For the first time in his life, he had someone who cared for him, someone he could trust.
His father noticed his disquiet. ""Is something wrong, Cedric?""
""No,"" he answered quickly. ""I'm fine. It's just … well, I've never had anyone touch me before. Not like this.""
She laughed. ""Oh, you poor child!""
He blushed and looked down at his plate. ""It's not funny, Mother.""
She chuckled. ""All children must learn to stand on their own feet someday. Now sit up and finish your supper.""
Cedric did as she said, but he didn't enjoy the meal. All he could think about was Greta. His father noticed how distracted he was and asked him gently, ""What's wrong?""
""Nothing."" But his voice sounded defensive, so he added, ""I'm just tired. I'm going to bed early tonight.""
""Okay,"" his father agreed. ""Come to me when you wake up in the morning.",1148,0.4407750032037911,-1.419060725358306,-1.358016610985892,0.5643640899608402,-1.4387507925142364
166,R_2Xj4JBVpeDM5TXW,BAS_HR_10,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He couldn't help but stare as she ate from the bowl that had been placed on the table before her. It wasn't just because she looked so beautiful—though she did, with long black hair and eyes that were green enough to make him think of spring leaves. No, it was more than that; there was something about her that made him want to know everything about her. But when he finally got up the nerve to ask if she wanted anything else, she turned away and left without saying a word.
He hadn't seen her since then, though he often thought about her. And now here she was again, sitting at another table in the same tavern, this time eating alone. She seemed different somehow, though he couldn't say exactly what it was. The way she carried herself, perhaps? Or maybe it was how she held herself, as if she were afraid someone would see her. That was why he kept his distance, watching from afar.
She finished her meal quickly and rose to leave. As soon as she stood up, he hurried over to her table. ""Excuse me,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I didn't get your name.""
""It's not important,"" she replied curtly.
""Well, if you don't mind my asking...?""
Her expression softened slightly. ""My name is Aella,"" she told him. Her voice was soft and sweet, and he could tell right away that she was a woman who knew how to use it.
""Aella,"" he repeated. ""That's an unusual name.""
""Not really,"" she said. ""There are many people named Aella in the city, including myself.""
""How interesting,"" he murmured. Then he leaned forward and whispered, ""If you're ever in need of a friend, you can always count on me. I'll be happy to talk with you anytime.""
She smiled at him and nodded. ""Thank you for your kind offer, but I have no need for friends. My life has been very lonely, after all.""
He felt terrible. What must she be going through? How sad! He wanted to take her by the hand and lead her out of the tavern, but he resisted the urge. Instead, he took her arm gently in his own and led her outside.
""You seem troubled,"" he remarked. ""Would you like some company until you feel better?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Why would you do such a thing?""
""Because I want to,"" he answered simply.
""But why?"" she asked. ""What good will it do?""
""Perhaps nothing. Perhaps a great deal,"" he replied. ""I'm just trying to show you that you aren't alone anymore.""
She stared at him for a moment, then smiled and said, ""Thank you. You've helped me a lot today.""
As they walked down the street together, she suddenly stopped in front of a shop window. There was something inside that caught her attention. ""Look!"" she exclaimed excitedly. ""Isn't this pretty?""
He followed her gaze and saw a pair of earrings in the display case. They were silver and shaped like flowers. ""Yes, they are,"" he agreed. ""They look lovely on you.""
""Oh, thank you!"" she gushed. ""This is my birthday present from my mother. I haven't even had a chance to wear them yet.""
""Then let me give you mine instead,"" he said. ""After all, I already have two pairs of earrings, and I rarely wear either of them. This way, you can have both.""
""Really?"" she asked, looking pleased.
""Of course. Now, shall we go back to the tavern?""
""Good idea,"" she replied.
Back at the tavern, she put on the earrings, and he admired their beauty. ""These are gorgeous,"" he said. ""Wherever did you find them?""
""At this shop,"" she replied. ""Do you know it?""
""No, I don't,"" he admitted.
""It's called 'The Flower Shop,' and it's located near the market square. I think you'd enjoy visiting it sometime.""
""I'd love to,"" he said. ""Maybe next week, if you're free.""
""Great! I'll meet you there.""
And so, every day after work, he went to the flower shop with her. Sometimes they talked about the weather or the latest news in the city. Other times they simply enjoyed each other's company.
One evening, she mentioned that her birthday was coming up. ""Have you decided what you're going to get for your gift?"" he asked.
""No, I haven't,"" she confessed. ""But I know what I want. I want a man who loves me.""
""I can't promise you that,"" he told her. ""But I can try to help you find him.""
""You mean you'll introduce us?"" she asked eagerly.
""Yes, I suppose I will,"" he replied. ""If he seems like someone you might like, I'll bring him to the tavern one night. If you approve, I'll ask him to join our little group.""
""That sounds wonderful!"" she exclaimed. ""Will you do that for me?""
""Of course,"" he assured her. ""Now, what should I call him? Do you have any suggestions?""
""His name is Cade,"" she said. ""Cade, this is Aella.""
""Pleased to meet you,"" he replied.
""Likewise,"" she responded. ""I hope you'll come visit me again soon.""
""I will,"" he promised. ""In fact, I'll see you tomorrow night.""
When she left, he sat at the table for a while, thinking. He hadn't expected things to turn out quite this way, but he liked it very much indeed.
He returned to the tavern and found his friends gathered around the table. ""Did you hear the news?"" he asked.
""What news?"" asked one of them.
""Aella and Cade are getting married!""
""Who's marrying whom?"" asked another.
""Don't you know?"" asked the first. ""They're engaged!""
""Engaged?"" gasped the second. ""Are you sure?""
""Yes, I'm sure!"" he answered. ""Aella told me herself.""
""So, when's the wedding?"" the third asked.
""Tomorrow afternoon,"" he replied. ""She wants to celebrate tonight.""
Everyone cheered. ""We'll have to throw her a party!""",1009,1.368624114211875,-1.692550012893062,1.5566887382651113,-1.1939475970652944,0.3680619421880287
167,R_9sNwmb81lWTPgR3,ALL_HF_10,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Is this the place?"" asked the wizard, looking around in surprise as he stepped down off his horse.
""This is it,"" answered the old woman. ""I've never been here before but I heard tales of it. It's been abandoned for centuries now.""
""But there are people here?"" asked the mage. He scanned the horizon for any sign of movement, but saw none.
""I don't think so,"" replied the old woman. ""If there were, you'd have seen them by now."" She shook her head. ""There was talk that there might be someone living here again recently, though I'm not sure if they're still alive. If you can find the man who lives here, though, he'll know what to do.""
""What about these two?"" asked the mage as he pointed toward the towers. ""Why are they empty?""
""Oh, those two? They belong to the lord of this valley. He keeps his treasure in the one on the right, and he has a large army camped outside the other. You won't get very far trying to steal from him.""
""So how did you end up with these?"" he asked. ""It's not as if they belong to you.""
""They're mine,"" she answered. ""He just lets me use them. It's better than having nothing."" She paused, then looked at the wizard. ""You're not going to rob the place, are you?""
The old woman smiled. ""Of course not! I only brought you here because I thought it would be useful for you to see what you were dealing with. You can take the treasure back with you and we can all live happily ever after."" She laughed.
""I don't think that's how it works,"" said the wizard.
""Well, maybe not. But you'll have to be careful when you leave. The lord will have eyes and ears everywhere.""
""And you're going to help us escape?""
""I'm going to make sure you don't get caught, no matter what you do. So I'll have to help you get away, somehow. Maybe I'll be able to slip out with you or something. Who knows? But you mustn't get caught.""
""How am I supposed to get out without being noticed?""
""Just pretend you belong there and act like you know where you're going. Don't talk to anyone and keep your head down.""
""That shouldn't be too difficult,"" said the mage. He scratched his chin and considered his options. ""I suppose we should get started then. We don't want to waste any time.""
The old woman nodded. ""There's a path that leads to the towers from the village, so we might as well start there.""
She pointed off toward the west, toward the tower on the right.
The mage nodded. ""Sounds good."" He looked around. ""I guess I'll go first.""
The old woman shook her head. ""No, you go second. That way if anyone sees you coming they'll think you're going to steal something.""
He frowned but said nothing.
The old woman smiled and patted the mage's arm. ""I know it doesn't seem fair, but you have to remember that this is my home. You don't have any reason to trust me. If you go first, everyone in the village will wonder what's going on, and they might start asking questions.""
""Fair enough,"" agreed the wizard. He turned and walked to the edge of the village, then stopped and looked around. The old woman was right; there was no one there, which meant that he'd have to rely on his own wits for the moment.
He took a deep breath and started walking toward the tower, trying to look like he belonged there. His cloak fluttered behind him in the breeze and his staff made an occasional clicking noise against the ground. He reached the base of the tower and climbed up the steps to its main entrance.
A small door was set into the wall and the mage reached out and grasped the handle. The door swung open easily, revealing a narrow hallway that ran back and forth along the length of the tower. It looked as though it had been used for storage at one point, with crates and barrels piled everywhere.
The mage stepped inside and started to walk down the corridor, his eyes searching the room as he went.
He paused in front of a large chest and examined it, but found nothing of interest inside. He continued on and passed several other rooms before finally reaching another doorway. This time the door opened inward and revealed a small, cramped room. A bed and some chairs were pushed up against one side of the room, leaving only a little space between them and the walls. A table was placed in the middle of the room and a few candles were lit in various places around it.
There was someone sitting at the table.
""Hello?"" said the wizard.
The figure turned to face him, then jumped out of his chair and began to run out the door. The mage followed quickly after.
They ran through the tower and out into a wide hallway. The mage slowed his pace and caught up with the figure just before it reached the stairway leading up.
The man spun around and pointed a dagger at the wizard, but before he could say anything, the mage grabbed the blade and pulled it from his hand. He then slammed the man's arm into the wall, causing him to fall to the floor.
The mage grabbed his hair and forced his head back. ""Who are you?""
The man struggled for a moment, but the wizard tightened his grip.
""I-I'm not sure,"" stammered the man. ""But I think I know what you are.""
""You do?"" asked the mage.
""Yes. You're a wizard!""
The mage released his grip and let go of the man's hair. ""I am.""
""So are we! I mean, me and my friends. We've been waiting for someone to come rescue us."" He looked around. ""Where is everyone?""
The mage sighed and shook his head. ""They don't want to be rescued, that's all. They've been waiting here for years and they're used to being alone. I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else.""
""Wait!"" said the man. ""Are you going to let us out? Please, please, I won't tell anyone about you. Just let us go.""
""And why would I do that?"" asked the mage. ""I can't imagine it would be very difficult for you to escape if I wanted to.""",1150,0.5511253998493931,1.4766747685981094,-0.02608655162010237,-0.09845256183964668,0.40779580124934867
168,R_2czRSDm3OAra1Fz,FAN_HOR_5,Horror,Fandango,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had eyes that looked like they were made of liquid, with a long tongue coming out the side and a mouth full of teeth. It spoke in a hissing, gurgling voice that sounded like snakes in a box, ""You know you want this."" The face continued staring at me as the lips moved, ""All you have to do is give in...""
I couldn't move, couldn't scream. This thing had paralyzed me. I tried everything to stop whatever it was doing, but nothing worked. I wanted it to go away, but instead, it became more aggressive, its voice rising in pitch.
""Oh yes...Give in...""
It reached out for me and pulled my hair, which it did by the roots. Then it bit down on my throat and tore the skin off me. Blood poured from the wound, coating me like I was a child again at the dentist's office.
I woke up screaming, covered in sweat, shaking. For a moment, I felt like I was going crazy. It must be the heat getting to me. I went to get some water to drink and cool off. After that, I lay back down in the bed, hoping I would go back to sleep.
But before I knew it, I heard the same voice in my head. ""You know you want this.""
I sat straight up in bed, sweating and terrified. There was no mistaking it. I heard it clearly now. As soon as I thought about it, the voice was right there. I felt my heart pounding inside my chest. It was like it was talking directly to me.
""Don't be afraid,"" the voice said. My body shivered. I reached for the knife on my night stand but was too afraid to touch it. I didn't know what could happen if I did.
The voice spoke again, ""Just imagine how good it will feel when you're buried under all of this."" It started laughing. I saw the reflection in my room begin to change into a nightmare landscape. There was a forest in the mirror, the trees and brush bending towards me. I could feel the leaves of the bushes tearing my clothes off.
Then the voice changed. It said, ""I'm going to rip your throat out slowly.""
I stood up and stumbled out into the hallway. My mind was racing. Why had it done that? Was this a hallucination brought on by the heat?
I was still trying to figure it out when I heard the knocking sound again. I turned and ran back into my room. I grabbed the phone and hit speed dial.
A voice answered, ""Hello?""
My mind was still foggy. I was trying to focus on what I wanted to say but couldn't remember any word that seemed to fit. I was about to hang up when it came to me. I just had to keep saying the same thing over and over.
""I can't remember what I'm supposed to say!"" I screamed, then hung up.
As soon as I did so, I heard something behind me. It wasn't the knock at the door. It was closer. It sounded like someone was crawling through the mirror. I turned around and looked into my mirror, which was now shattered into thousands of pieces. There was a man, a dark haired, handsome man in a black suit with a red tie, reaching out to me. He said, ""Don't be afraid, little girl.""
The mirror exploded behind him, and there were other reflections. There were dozens of them. All of them men, all reaching out to me, calling my name.
The voices came again. ""Come out, come out, wherever you are. We have what you want, and we're gonna take you where you've never been, where nothing is safe!""
I ran into my bathroom, locked myself in, then began throwing objects at the mirror. Glass flew everywhere, crashing against the wall and floor. I picked up the bottle of vodka and smashed it against the mirror. It broke apart and fell into a thousand pieces across the floor.
""No,"" I whispered. ""Please, no.""
I began to cry uncontrollably. I felt sick and scared. I was so thirsty and hot. I needed water. I needed something to drink. But I was afraid to leave the bathroom, afraid that whatever had been in my mirror would show up in real life.
It was a long time before I finally calmed down enough to look at myself in the mirror. I looked horrible. My face was covered in blood, and I was trembling. My clothes were torn, and my hair was hanging in disheveled strands.
I couldn't believe what I saw. That wasn't me.
I ran to the mirror and slammed it shut. The glass broke, and it fell to the ground, shattering more. I stood in front of it and stared at myself. I was still terrified, and I didn't know what to do.
When the knocking came again, I turned around. This time, it wasn't in my head. It was real.
""We have to get together. It's the only way to survive,"" the voice said. ""Come out! Come out!""
I couldn't move. I couldn't make myself run. I was terrified. The voices were louder. It was coming closer. I looked up to see an image of me standing in front of me. It was blurry and hard to understand. The voice said, ""If you don't, we'll break your door down and take you.""
Something pushed me from behind, then I heard the shattering of glass. The mirror fell on top of me and cut into my arm. I screamed, but the voices were still coming at me. Someone took hold of my arms, and I screamed again, thinking it was them. But they held me down.
There was more breaking glass. And another voice. This one was stronger and clearer.
""I told you to come out!""
He was right next to me, the man in the suit with the red tie. He was holding my wrists, but they were tied tightly together. I was terrified. I kept trying to turn around, to see who was attacking me. But whoever it was held me down easily. I looked up at the man's face.
""I told you to come out!"" he repeated. It was the same voice I'd heard before in my mirror.
I struggled and yelled, ""What do you want?""
He released my hands and grabbed my face again. There was something inside it moving, like it had a mind of its own.
""I have a gift for you. You don't understand, and it won't make sense to you right now, but I promise you, everything will be better once you join us. Trust me.""",1173,0.3483652606657172,-0.8145093394141539,0.685675017317211,-1.962609372052715,-0.6316611684369714

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature had risen considerably since yesterday, when it'd been below freezing outside.
It wasn't uncommon for me to be called upon by the president, but today's meeting would be different than any other time I'd met with him before. Today, he wanted to talk about our plans for the future. He knew what I thought about the situation; he just didn't want anyone else to know yet. That meant only three people were going to be present at the meeting: myself, the president, and Dr. Sato.
The president's office was located in a large white building near the center of the city. We entered through its front doors and walked down a long hallway until we reached one of many elevators. When it opened up, we stepped inside and rode it all the way to the top floor. Once there, we exited the elevator and went straight toward another set of double glass doors. As soon as they slid open, we walked into the president's private office.
President Taggart sat behind his desk, looking out at us with a serious expression on his face. His hands rested on the edge of his desk, and his eyes seemed to be focused somewhere far away. ""You've done well so far,"" he began after a moment of silence. ""But now is not the time to rest on your laurels. There are still more problems to solve.""
""Yes sir,"" I replied. ""We're working hard every day to find solutions.""
""I'm aware of that,"" President Taggart answered. ""However, we need to take things a step further. You'll be given additional resources to continue your work, and I expect you to make good use of them. If we don't get these problems solved, then we may never leave this planet again.""
I nodded in agreement. ""Understood.""
""Good,"" he said, standing up from his chair. ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some meetings to attend to. Dr. Sato will show you to your new offices while I'm gone."" He turned around and left the room without waiting for a response.
Dr. Sato led us out of the office and back down the hall. She stopped in front of a door and handed me a key card. ""This should get you into the building. Just go right past the receptionist and head upstairs. Room 203 is where you'll be staying. Your assistant has already been assigned to you, and she'll be showing you how everything works once you arrive.""
""Thank you,"" I said.
She smiled. ""Don't mention it. Now, I must return to my duties. Have a nice day!"" With that, she turned and headed off down the hallway.
After leaving Dr. Sato, I made my way across the lobby and into the elevator. When the doors opened up, I stepped inside and pressed the button for the third floor. After a few seconds, the doors closed, and the elevator started moving upward. I looked at the numbers above the doors as they counted upwards, watching the digital display count up to the top floor.
When the doors opened up, I stepped out onto a large hallway. A sign hanging next to the entrance read ""Office of the President."" At the end of the hall, I saw two men dressed in black suits talking to each other. They both had dark hair and wore sunglasses even though it was daytime. One of the men held a briefcase, and the other man had a tablet computer in his hand.
As I approached, the man with the tablet computer turned around and gave me a nod. ""Hello, Mr. Smith,"" he said. ""Welcome to the office.""
""Thanks,"" I replied. ""I appreciate the warm welcome.""
""Not a problem,"" he responded. ""Just doing our job.""
I nodded and continued walking down the hallway until I reached a set of double glass doors. I pushed one of them open and walked inside. Inside the room was a woman sitting behind a large wooden desk. Her short blonde hair was neatly combed, and she was wearing a blue business suit.
""Mr. Smith?"" she asked.
I nodded. ""That's me.""
""Please, have a seat,"" she said, gesturing to one of the chairs in front of her desk. I sat down and waited for her to finish typing something on her computer.
""So, you're the new guy,"" she said, finally looking up from the keyboard and giving me a smile. ""How do you like it so far?""
""It's been pretty great so far,"" I replied. ""Everyone's been very welcoming.""
""Excellent,"" she said. ""I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's get you set up.""
She got up from her chair and walked over to a cabinet that was built into the wall. She pulled out a small box and placed it on the table in front of me. ""This is your badge,"" she said, holding it up for me to see. ""You'll need this to access most areas of the building, including your office. You can also use it to get into your apartment.""
""Oh, okay,"" I said, taking the badge and placing it in my pocket. ""Where exactly am I supposed to put this thing? My pockets are full of stuff already.""
""There's a drawer under the table,"" she answered. ""If you'll look there, you'll find a small metal plate. Place the badge on top of it, and it'll lock in place.""
I did as she told me and watched as the badge locked itself into place. ""Okay, thanks,"" I said, getting up from the chair and walking over to the cabinet.
""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" she asked.
""No, that's it,"" I said. ""I think I'm good to go.""
""Great,"" she said. ""Well, I'll let you get settled in. If you need anything, just give me a call.""
With that, she turned around and left the room. I picked up the box and carried it over to the cabinet, placing it inside the drawer and closing the door. Then, I walked over to the window and looked out at the view of the city.
I was in the middle of the city, surrounded by buildings and people. The windows were tinted slightly, blocking out the sunlight. I could see the tops of the tall buildings poking out from behind the clouds. In the distance, I saw a large dome-shaped structure. It was probably the science facility that we used to study the planet's environment.
I glanced down at the badge in my pocket, remembering the conversation I'd had with Dr. Sato earlier.",1153,0.7623847244855353,-0.4693036095388192,-0.8219954011982895,-0.3144588969266854,0.5639898971914487
170,R_d6xMxzx3eX3Yi53,GEN_HSF_1,Hard Sci-Fi,Genesis,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature was a balmy seventy degrees Celsius.
""Hey, Dave!"" called Alex as he emerged from the building next door. He waved and waited for me to catch up. ""Did you get your new computer set up yet?"" Alex had just gotten back from Earth several months ago, where he'd been training to be a pilot for the Mars mission. His sister, Molly, was also coming along. We were going to be living together while we were waiting to go to Mars.
""Yeah, I've got it all hooked up now. How about you? Did they give you your new assignment?""
Alex shook his head. ""Nope, still no word. They haven't even started sending people down to train for that yet.""
""Well, since we're both stuck here until then, why don't we go out and do something?""
We walked over to the nearby park. There were plenty of trees around there, so the air would be nice and cool. I saw Alex's two friends, Michael and Kip, walking toward us.
""Hey guys! What are you doing today?"" asked Alex.
""Nothing much. Just hanging out,"" replied Michael, a tall, skinny guy who looked like he could be an athlete or a model.
""No kidding. You guys look bored. Want to come play some pickup basketball?"" I suggested.
Michael laughed. ""I can't believe you even know what that is.""
""Do I?"" I said. ""You should try it sometime. It's really fun.""
The four of us went ahead and played a few games. By the end of our time in the park, everyone was sweaty but happy. We decided to walk back to our respective apartments.
As we approached mine, I noticed a young man standing on my front stoop. He wore a white lab coat and held a clipboard in one hand.
""Morning!"" he said cheerfully. ""My name is Dr. Peter Aikens. I'm here from the National Institute of Health to check up on you. Would you mind if we came inside? I need to take your blood pressure and temperature, just to make sure everything's okay.""
""Sure, go right ahead,"" I answered.
Dr. Aiken stepped past me and opened the door. As soon as he did, I smelled an unpleasant odor coming from within. I followed him inside and closed the door behind me.
""Why don't you have a seat?"" I gestured to the couch. ""Would you like anything to drink?""
""Oh, I'm good thanks,"" said Dr. Aiken. ""But please, call me Pete. No one ever does.""
""Okay, Pete."" I nodded. ""Can I get you anything?""
""No, thank you. I'll be fine.""
""So, Pete, how long will this take?"" I asked.
""Just a few minutes. Don't worry, it won't hurt at all,"" he reassured me.
Pete sat himself down on the couch across from me. He pulled out a small device and pressed it against his ear. After a few seconds, he put it away and began writing down notes on his clipboard.
""You live alone, right?"" he asked. ""Is anyone else home?""
I hesitated. ""I guess my girlfriend is. She's upstairs.""
""That's okay. I'll only be gone for a minute or two. I want to make sure you're healthy enough to travel to Mars.""
""Oh, that's not necessary. I'm perfectly healthy.""
""Really?"" Pete tilted his head curiously. ""You don't look sick to me. Do you feel any different lately?""
""I'm sorry, Pete, but I really can't tell you that. I'm sure you understand.""
Pete sighed. ""Yes, I do. But I'm going to have to ask you to come with me, anyway. This is an official government matter.""
""I really don't think—""
""It's alright,"" he interrupted. ""It won't be for too long. I promise.""
""Alright, well, I'll be right back.""
I ran up the stairs and knocked on the bedroom door. ""Gina? Dr. Aiken is here.""
There wasn't a response. I tried again, louder this time. Still nothing. I let myself in the room and found Gina sprawled out on the bed.
""Gina?"" I knelt down beside her. ""Are you okay?""
She didn't respond. Her eyes were closed and she was breathing shallowly. I lifted her head and felt for her pulse. It was faint, but steady.
What am I supposed to do? I thought.
I quickly dialed 911 and told them what happened. They sent an ambulance and two police officers over immediately.
""This isn't looking good,"" said Detective Sergeant Crenshaw. ""Maybe you should go wait in the hallway.""
I nodded and left the room. When I returned, they'd taken Gina out of the house on a gurney. She hadn't woken up. I watched as they wheeled her out of the house and into the ambulance.
""Is she okay?"" I asked the officer. ""What happened?""
He shook his head sadly. ""Her vitals are pretty low. We've done CPR and given her fluids, but it looks like we may have lost her.""
""Who was she?"" I asked.
""Just a neighbor,"" he replied. ""She looked a little frail, but we never expected anything like this to happen.""
""I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?""
Detective Crenshaw shrugged. ""Not really. If you need to speak to the coroner, just let me know.""
After the ambulance drove off, I sat down on the curb and leaned my head against the side of my car. I felt numb. My eyes wandered aimlessly. I couldn't stop thinking about what had just happened. I knew I needed to follow up with the police later, but first I wanted to find out more information about what had happened to Gina.
I pulled out my phone and searched for news stories about sudden deaths. There were plenty of articles about people dying suddenly, sometimes without warning. I clicked on one of the links and read the story.
""A twenty-three year old woman named Gina Martin was found dead in her home earlier today. According to local authorities, Ms. Martin suffered from a rare genetic disease known as Marfan Syndrome.",1052,-1.0104155420610168,0.5804057567250602,0.8457405710116637,0.703356221301939,0.5350456407314252
171,R_1LNIAJbMJyOEHHo,BAS_HSF_2,Hard Sci-Fi,Basic Coherence,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The air felt warm against my face as I walked down the street toward the presidential palace.
The streets were empty except for a few people going about their daily business. I saw one old woman pushing a cart filled with vegetables, another man carrying two large bags of grain across his shoulders, and a young couple holding hands while they walked past me. As I passed them, I could see the girl looking up at me curiously. She had dark brown skin like mine but wore a white dress with purple trim. Her hair was braided tightly around her head, and she looked familiar somehow...
A flash of memory came back to me then. When I'd first arrived on Mars, I'd been taken to a small village where I met a girl just like her. We had talked together for hours until we finally went our separate ways. But what had happened between us? Had she left me or did I leave her? And why hadn't I thought about her since then?
My thoughts drifted away from the girl as I neared the palace. I didn't want to think about her anymore. Instead, I focused on the meeting I would be having later today with President Fisk. He wanted to discuss the possibility of establishing a permanent colony on Mars. At first, I'd been excited by the idea, but now I wasn't so sure. My mind kept returning to the girl from my memories. What if she really was important to me? If I agreed to help build a new colony on Mars, how long would I have to stay there before I could return home again? Would I even want to go back after all these years?
As I approached the entrance to the palace, I noticed something odd. A large group of men wearing black uniforms were gathered outside the gates, talking among themselves. They seemed to be waiting for someone, but no one else was around. Curious, I stopped and watched them for a moment. One of them turned to look at me, and I recognized him immediately.
It was General Stearn!
I couldn't believe he was here. How had he found me? Why was he here? I stood there staring at him for several seconds before I realized that I should probably say something. So I cleared my throat nervously and called out, ""General?""
He turned around quickly and smiled when he saw me. ""Hello, Mr. Smith,"" he replied. ""What are you doing here?""
""Dr. Sato told me that the president wants to talk to me,"" I answered.
Stearn nodded. ""That's right. Come with me. We'll get you inside.""
We started walking toward the front gate, and I asked, ""How did you find me?""
""I've been following your progress ever since you landed on Mars,"" he explained. ""I'm impressed by everything you're accomplishing here. You must be very proud of yourself.""
I laughed. ""Well, I am. I guess I never really thought about it before, but I do feel pretty good about myself. I mean, I'm not exactly like other people. Not everyone can spend five hundred years on Mars without aging a bit!""
Stearn chuckled. ""Yes, I suppose you're right. But don't worry too much about it. Everyone ages differently on Mars anyway. Some of us age faster than others. Yours is just a little slower.""
""Oh, yeah? Well, I still haven't aged a day in all this time, and I don't plan on starting anytime soon!""
""Okay, okay,"" said Stearn. ""Let's drop the whole 'aging' thing. It doesn't matter. All that matters is that you're here. Now, let's get inside.""
Once we reached the gates, Stearn opened them for me. Inside, a soldier escorted me through the halls of the palace and into the president's office. I saw Dr. Sato sitting at a desk near the door, along with several other scientists and engineers who worked for the government. They all looked up as I entered and gave me polite smiles. I waved to them and sat down in the chair next to the president.
President Fisk looked tired and worried. His dark hair was thinning, and his face was wrinkled like an old man's. He had a long scar running across his forehead, which made him look more intimidating than he actually was. The general leaned forward and said, ""Mr. Smith, I have some bad news for you.""
""What kind of bad news?"" I asked.
Fisk sighed and said, ""There's been a terrorist attack on Earth. Several nuclear bombs have been detonated, and most of the population has been wiped out. There are only a few survivors, and they're all hiding underground somewhere. We've lost contact with the rest of the world.""
""What?!"" I gasped. ""But how could this happen? Who could possibly do such a thing?""
""We don't know yet,"" answered the general. ""All we know is that it was done by someone who knew how to use the technology we developed for our colony on Mars. Whoever it was, they managed to sneak onto Earth undetected and set off the nukes before anyone could stop them.""
""So, what does this mean for us?"" I asked. ""Are we safe here on Mars?""
""No, unfortunately not,"" replied the president. ""This means that we need to start preparing for the worst. I've already sent a message to the UN, and they're sending a team of scientists over to investigate the situation. Once they figure out who did it, we'll be ready to move on them and put an end to their evil plans once and for all.""
""Wait a minute,"" I interrupted. ""You said you'd sent a message to the UN? But I thought we weren't allowed to communicate with Earth anymore.""
The president frowned and shook his head. ""Not directly, no. But we can send messages to the UN through the Mars colony. That's how we got word of the attack in the first place. I figured we might as well take advantage of the fact that we're connected to Earth.""
""And what will the UN do?"" I asked.
Fisk shrugged. ""They won't be able to do anything until the investigation is complete. But I'm sure they'll come up with something. They always do.""
The president turned to me and asked, ""Do you have any ideas about how we should respond to this threat? Do you think we should prepare for war?""
""War?"" I repeated. ""With whom? I don't understand.""
""I'm sorry, Mr. Smith,"" said the president.",1147,0.4624987792501009,0.8210033633249598,0.9881254742038815,0.7977090768458438,0.9484186039429573
172,R_OqgDBEiAY9a2Zt7,GEN_HSF_5,Hard Sci-Fi,Genesis,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. Our solar panels could easily produce enough energy to keep us going even without direct sunlight, but if we wanted to save power, we had to stay inside as much as possible during the summer months.
The walk to work only took about ten minutes, which gave me plenty of time to think about what I would say when the president asked why it took so long for us to find a second habitable planet. The truth was that I hadn't really considered that there might be others who were looking for an Earth 2.0, or whatever they called their version of our world. But now that he mentioned it, we did have some competition. Of course, the other planets weren't exactly easy to spot from orbit, but the chances were good that someone else was searching for them too.
But that was all hypothetical. There was no way anyone could know about these other worlds until one of us discovered them first. Right? That's what I kept telling myself, anyway. My thoughts turned back to the president's letter. The more I thought about it, the less confident I felt that we should tell him anything at all about any of this. I mean, I didn't even know where the hell we were sitting on this new planet. All we knew about it was that it orbited around a star in the constellation Monoceros, and that was the extent of the information we had received from the probe.
So what if there is another civilization living on some other world? Did we really want to admit that we were capable of such a feat? I couldn't help thinking about my own life—all the things I had given up just to come here to this planet. And not only was I giving up on everything back home, but also the potential for a future with my girlfriend. No, there was no way I would ever let him know we found another world.
As I continued through town, I noticed that people seemed unusually busy. Everyone was hurrying to get places, and as I approached the presidential palace, I saw that the crowds outside were thicker than usual. When I finally made it to the front, I found the area completely blocked off by metal barricades. Two soldiers standing on either side looked at me curiously, but neither of them spoke to me. They just pointed toward a nearby staircase leading downward.
A sign above the entrance to the stairs read ""Presidential Office."" As I reached the bottom, I passed several armed guards wearing purple uniforms. One of them glanced at me as I walked past, but said nothing. The rest of the guards were focused on keeping the crowd moving forward. In some ways, it reminded me of rush hour at Chicago O'Hare Airport, except this was more like rush hour in Times Square on New Year's Eve.
I tried to make my way through the crowd of people, but I quickly became overwhelmed. Every few steps, I'd hear the shrill sound of a siren from somewhere behind me, followed by the sound of gunfire. Before I knew it, I was trapped against the wall of a building as bullets ricocheted off the stone below me. For a moment, I thought that maybe I should run and try to get away from it all—to somehow escape this madness. But then I realized that any attempt at escape would probably end badly, whether that meant getting shot or simply running into something else.
My mind flashed back to when I was in high school. I was playing basketball in gym class, when one of the guys on the other team dove for the ball, trying to block my shot. But as soon as he pushed me, I fell backward onto the floor of the court. His knee came down hard on my chest, and the next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. But while I was laying there, confused and dazed, I heard the nurse saying, ""You're lucky you didn't break anything. Your heart stopped beating, but luckily one of your classmates saved your life.""
Suddenly, I realized that my situation wasn't much different. I had been pushed back against the wall, and now it was up to me to figure out how to keep myself alive. So I braced myself against the cold stone, clenched my fists, and waited for the gunfire to stop.
After a few seconds, the shooting abruptly ended, and I heard footsteps approaching. A familiar voice shouted, ""Get back! Stay down!""
When I turned to see who it was, I saw a tall man in a blue uniform pointing a gun directly at me. He yelled again, ""Stay there! Don't move or I'll shoot!""
I froze, unable to speak.
At last, the man lowered his weapon and moved closer to me, pulling his face mask down to reveal a pair of dark eyes. As he got close enough to talk, I could smell the faint scent of alcohol on his breath. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked.
I hesitated, not sure how much I should tell him. But before I could answer, he shook his head and said, ""Never mind. You can't afford to know the answer to that question. Keep walking.""
As he led me away, I saw that he was carrying a large black bag. I wondered what kind of equipment he was carrying. After all, it wouldn't make sense for him to bring weapons out here if he didn't need them.
We slowly approached the edge of the crowd, and when we were able to get by the barricade, he pushed me forward. He looked back at me and said, ""You've got one chance to live, and I'm not going to waste it on explaining anything to you. Just follow my orders and do exactly what I say, otherwise you're dead. Understood?""
I nodded silently.
He smiled and said, ""Good. Now listen closely. We don't have much time, so pay attention.""
He pulled out a small device and pressed a button on it. In response, a series of red lights lit up on its surface. Then he pointed it at the ground and said, ""There. See that rock there? Go ahead and pick it up. Make sure you don't drop it.""
For a moment, I was still frozen in place, wondering what the hell he was talking about. But once I started moving, I realized that he must have brought a camera along with him. He was probably using it to take pictures of the crowd so that his superiors could better understand what was happening here.
Soon, I found myself holding a rock. I looked at it for a moment, then turned back to the man, unsure of what to do next.
""Just walk over to that guy over there,"" he said. ""Walk right up to him and give him the rock. Then turn around and go straight back to the start. Got it?""
I nodded once more. He pressed another button on the device, and two of the red lights began flashing. Then he said, ""Go.""
I stood there for a moment longer, taking in the sights around me.",1273,-0.1959803380989733,0.2405444166050541,-0.6072941533977878,-0.31613522663650734,-0.15171663536051216
173,R_pSlyunfdAKMG8EN,GEN_HF_6,High Fantasy,Genesis,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""You're sure this is where we need to go?"" he asked. ""The river here doesn't look very deep.""
""This is one of the most important places in all of the lands,"" said Naius. ""People come here from all around to pay homage to the gods and pray for guidance.""
""I see,"" said Olem, though that wasn't quite what he meant.
Naius didn't seem to notice his confusion. ""It's about time you saw something so beautiful. I'm tired of your complaining. You'd think you were back at home again.""
Olem shook his head. He hated how easily his friend could get him riled up these days. As much as he hated to admit it, there was truth to Naius' words. He had been complaining more than usual since they left Aratay and headed south, and now here was another example. If only he would just shut up and let them continue on without questioning every little thing.
They walked down a dirt road that meandered between the houses toward the center of the village. Olem eyed the buildings as they passed. They weren't large like the ones in the cities they had visited, but they looked sturdy enough. There were no windows and few doors that he could see, but the rooflines all appeared to be constructed from wood rather than stone. The whole place smelled of fresh air and pine needles.
Ahead of them, Naius stopped abruptly and turned to face the wall surrounding the town. It was low enough that Olem couldn't see over it, but he could tell that a gate stood open at the top.
""That's odd,"" said Olem.
He stepped forward to see if he could make out any details, but the wall blocked his view completely.
""What do you mean?""
""Well, shouldn't there be guards here? This looks like an obvious spot to watch who comes and goes into the village.""
""So what? We'll just have to sneak in past whoever is guarding the gate.""
""We've already found ourselves in trouble once today. I don't want to risk getting caught again.""
Naius nodded thoughtfully, then took a step forward.
Olem jumped to keep pace with him. ""Wait! What are you doing?""
His friend kept walking forward until he reached the edge of the wall. Then he paused to peer over the top. He quickly disappeared from sight.
Olem waited for a moment, then called out, ""Hey, wait!""
There was no response. Olem tried to hear anything beyond the sounds of birds and water flowing over rocks.
After a moment, he turned around and started making his way back through the trees. When he neared the spot where they had emerged from the woods, he heard a sound behind him. He spun around and saw Naius coming back toward him, carrying something.
""What did you find up there?"" he asked.
""Nothing,"" answered Naius, tossing a handful of leaves onto the ground beside him. Olem bent down to pick them up.
""What are those?"" he asked. ""Are they from the trees?""
""No, these are from the forest floor.""
Olem glanced at him suspiciously. ""And what does that mean?""
""Just keep looking.""
Olem sighed in exasperation and set the leaves aside.
When he straightened back up, he was surprised to see that he was standing in front of the open gate.
Naius was waiting for him. ""This is the last one, Olem. Are you ready to go inside yet?""
The two of them climbed over the wall together, then made their way into the town.
As they walked, Olem studied the area carefully. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but he remained alert nonetheless. The villagers' clothing was different from what he was used to seeing in the city, but other than that, everything looked the same as it always did.
""Where are we going?"" he asked after a few minutes.
""To the temple of the gods. And believe me, you will not be disappointed.""
Olem followed his companion, wondering what sort of miracle Naius was talking about.
The streets were mostly empty, save for a couple of children playing nearby. Their parents, sitting on benches outside the buildings, watched them play until their youngest brother wandered too close to the edge of the lake. At that point, they all looked up and started shouting at him.
""What happened?"" asked Olem, stopping to listen.
""Don't wander off, boy!""
""Come back here right now!""
""I told you to stay away from the water!""
The boy, who couldn't have been older than eight, ran at the lake with a loud splash, startling several ducks that flew into the air in fright. His siblings laughed.
""Stop it!"" shouted one of the adults. ""You're going to scare them all away.""
The boy ignored her, running full speed toward the shore.
Then the scream came.
Olem dropped to his knees and covered his ears, trying to block out the sound. But it was no use. It pierced the air over and over again, echoing between the buildings.
Finally he realized that he recognized it.
""That's a woman's voice,"" he said.
Naius nodded grimly, clutching his forehead with both hands. ""Yes...it's terrible.""
He took a few steps closer to the water, then turned to stare at Olem. ""Do you know what this means?""
""I think so,"" said Olem. ""But let's get a little closer before we start guessing.""
They approached the edge of the lake, careful not to step inside the water itself.
Olem scanned the area, looking for any sign of the person who had screamed. There was nothing to indicate that anything bad had happened, which suggested that she hadn't fallen into the water after all.
""Maybe it was just a trick of the wind,"" he said, hoping to reassure himself.
""Do you really think that possible?"" asked Naius, moving closer to him. ""Think about it. What sort of noise would cause everyone within earshot to react this way?""
Olem frowned, thinking hard. He didn't have to search long for an answer.
""She was being murdered,"" he said.
Naius looked at him in horror. ""You can hear it?""
""Not exactly,"" answered Olem. ""But I know it's true. We just need to find her.""",1105,0.9241171783882218,0.6935407679750043,0.04234886242220732,-0.1587018307856574,0.07826777768165424
174,R_pB3NTxC8kOJfqsF,BAS_HF_8,High Fantasy,Basic Coherence,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""I wonder if anyone's still here,"" said Erian as he stared down at the settlement. ""It looks so quiet.""
""Perhaps we should wait until nightfall before going any further,"" suggested Aranthur. He pointed to the far end of the lake where a bridge crossed the river to the other shore. ""We could cross that way and see what is there.""
Erian nodded. ""That sounds good. I don't want to go anywhere near those towers without knowing who might be watching us.""
They set off toward the bridge. As they walked, Erian kept glancing back at the tower. It seemed to grow larger as they approached it. Finally, they reached the foot of the bridge. The water below was placid enough, but the surface rippled strangely. There were no boats on the lake.
As they neared the bridge, something moved beneath the water. It was a large shape moving slowly away from them. At first, Aranthur thought it was an animal—a crocodile perhaps—but then he realized that it was too big.
Aranthur stopped walking. ""What do you think that is?"" he asked Erian.
""I don't know,"" said Erian, his voice low. ""But it's not natural.""
There was another ripple under the water. Then more movement. Suddenly, a great white head broke the surface. It rose up out of the water and stood tall above the surface, looking straight at them. Its eyes were bright yellow and fixed on them. They saw long fangs, curved downward, and sharp claws. It had a snout like a wolf's but the body was much broader than any dog.
Then the creature turned and disappeared beneath the water again.
""Do you think it will come after us?"" asked Erian.
""No,"" said Aranthur. ""Not unless we try to cross the bridge.""
""Are you sure?""
""Yes. Look, it's gone now.""
The water rippled once more and then settled. The giant beast had vanished.
Aranthur shook his head. ""I don't understand it,"" he said.
Erian shrugged. ""Neither do I.""
The bridge was old, made of stone blocks held together with mortar. It was broad enough for four people to walk abreast, although the stones were uneven and the path was narrow. There was a gate at each end, which swung open easily.
Aranthur led the way across the bridge. Erian followed him closely. When they reached the other side, Aranthur paused.
""Wait here,"" he whispered. ""I'll look around.""
He crept forward, keeping his hands close to the hilts of his swords. His heart beat loudly in his chest. He glanced behind him several times, but the bridge was empty.
When he reached the far side of the bridge, he stopped. He looked down into the water. The ripples were still there. But they weren't moving anymore.
Aranthur stepped closer to the edge of the bridge. The water was clear and deep. He could see fish swimming lazily below. He leaned over the edge and peered down.
Suddenly, he felt a tugging at his leg. He yelped and fell backward onto the bridge. He heard a loud splash and then silence.
Aranthur lay on the bridge, staring at the water. After a moment, he got to his feet.
""Erian!"" he called.
There was no answer.
He ran back to the center of the bridge. He looked down at the water, but there was nothing there.
He knelt beside the water. Nothing stirred.
He stood and began to run back to Erian.
Something grabbed him from behind and dragged him down.
He screamed as he hit the water.
He tried to swim, but the water was cold and dark and full of weeds and rocks.
His arms and legs kicked frantically.
He couldn't breathe.
Someone pulled him under.
And then he was floating.
The water was warm and calm.
He opened his eyes.
He was lying on the bottom of the lake, his face inches from a rock.
He blinked, trying to focus.
He was alone.
He pushed himself up and climbed out of the water.
He shivered violently.
He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
He stood, shaking, and stared at the spot where he'd fallen.
Nothing.
He looked around.
Everything was silent.
There was no sign of Erian.
He took a few steps back, and suddenly he saw something.
It was Erian.
Or rather, it was Erian's body.
It floated facedown in the water.
Aranthur stared at it.
Erian's hair was matted with blood.
Aranthur gasped and turned away.
He sank to his knees.
""No,"" he whispered.
He put his hands over his face and sobbed.
After a while, he lifted his head.
He knew what he had to do.
He would have to leave Erian.
He didn't know how.
But he had to get back to the ship.
He stood and walked toward the bridge.
He was halfway across when he heard something.
It was faint, but it sounded like someone calling.
Aranthur looked back.
On the far side of the bridge, the water was disturbed.
Then, suddenly, a figure burst from the water and ran toward him.
It was Erian.
He was naked.
Aranthur stared at him.
Erian stopped about ten paces away.
""Erian?""
Erian stared at him.
""You're alive,"" said Aranthur.
""Yes.""
""How did you survive? You drowned.""
Erian shook his head. ""I'm not dead.""
""What do you mean?""
""I am a god,"" said Erian.
""I don't believe you.""
Erian laughed. ""Believe me, my friend, I am not joking.""
""Then why are you naked?""
Erian smiled. ""I wanted to make sure that no one could recognize me.""
""Why?""
""Because I'm a god.""
""No,"" said Aranthur. ""You can't be.""
""I am.""
""No. No, you're not.""",1015,0.043296537141189036,1.2826047801485267,0.14547224580763116,0.04223084928660149,0.09165103158025639
175,R_23Ww7EG0jqwtTpV,BAS_HR_6,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been so busy that day with customers who wanted to talk about their problems and ask for advice that she hadn't caught his eye until it was too late. When he finally realized what she was doing, he couldn't help but stare. She wore an old-fashioned dress of black wool, cut low on her neckline and showing off a lot more cleavage than he liked. Her hair was long and loose, falling down over her shoulders as if it were made from spun gold. It was such a pretty shade of blonde, and it seemed to glow against the dark color of her dress. The way she held herself reminded him of a cat—her head up high, chin out, eyes narrowed in disdain. But there was something else about her that drew his attention. There was no mistaking it; she was beautiful. Even though he knew better, he could not take his eyes off her.
He watched her as she drank her ale and ate some bread and cheese. He kept stealing glances at her even when he wasn't looking directly at her. His gaze would wander back to her every few minutes, but she never noticed him. She didn't seem to notice anyone except the people she spoke to or the other men who came by to flirt with her.
After she finished eating, she got up and went outside to smoke a pipe. That's when he decided to try to speak to her. He approached her and asked if she needed any assistance. She turned around, startled, then smiled at him. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""You startled me.""
""It's all right,"" he replied. ""What can I do for you?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Are you new here? You don't look familiar.""
""No, I've lived here most of my life. What can I do for you?""
Her smile widened. ""Well, I just need someone to carry this stuff to my room for me."" She handed him a large bag filled with clothes and shoes.
He took the bag and followed her upstairs. As they walked along, he tried to think of something clever to say to get her attention again. Finally, he blurted out, ""Do you know what happened to the king's daughter?""
She stopped walking and stared at him. ""Excuse me?""
""The princess. Do you know why she ran away?""
""Why should I care?"" she asked. ""I haven't seen her since she left home.""
""That's because she is dead,"" he said.
""Dead? How did she die?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Everyone says she died in childbirth, but I heard that she was murdered. Someone killed her baby and then stabbed her.""
""Oh, dear,"" she said. ""Did she have a husband?""
""Yes, but I don't think he knows anything about it yet. They're still searching for her body. If they find it, then he'll be notified.""
""Where will they search?""
""They won't tell us. All we know is that they are going to search everywhere.""
""So, how do you know she's dead?"" she asked.
""Because she was supposed to marry Prince Arvin, but now he has no wife. So, everyone thinks that the prince must have done it. And if he did, then he would want to hide the evidence so no one would ever suspect him.""
""But who could kill the princess without being caught?"" she asked.
He shrugged. ""Maybe someone who knew her very well. Maybe someone she trusted.""
""And why would she trust them?"" she asked.
""I don't know. Because they loved her, maybe.""
""How do you know she was pregnant?""
""Because her maid told me. She said she was carrying twins.""
""Twins?"" she repeated. ""Really? Why would she have two babies?""
""I don't know. Maybe she already had one child and wanted another.""
She shook her head. ""I don't understand women. I only know about men. Men always want to make more children, especially after they get married. Women usually don't want to.""
""Well, I guess that makes sense,"" he said.
""Does it really? I mean, I've never thought about it before.""
He nodded. ""I suppose it does.""
When they reached her door, he set the bag down and helped her take off her coat. Then she opened her trunk and pulled out several dresses.
""Can you put these in my room for me?"" she asked.
He picked up the bag and carried it inside while she changed. When she was ready to go downstairs, she thanked him and gave him a small coin.
""Thank you for your help,"" she said.
As he left, he wondered whether she would ever see him again. He hoped she would, but he wasn't sure. He wished he had spoken to her earlier, but he couldn't change what had happened. He might have missed his chance forever.
He went back to work, trying to forget about her. After all, he was engaged to be married, and he didn't need any distractions. He had a good job and a nice fiancée. He didn't need anything else.
Two days later, he was surprised to see her sitting at the same table where he worked. He almost dropped his tray of food. He quickly walked over to her and apologized for dropping it.
""Don't worry about it,"" she said. ""It's all right.""
""I'm sorry. I hope I didn't ruin your meal.""
""Not at all. It was just a little spill. No big deal.""
He smiled. ""Good. Now, let me clean it up.""
He grabbed a rag and cleaned it up as best he could. ""Here you go,"" he said. ""I hope you don't mind that I spilled it.""
""Of course not. Thank you.""
He felt awkward standing there, so he walked away. He couldn't believe she was still there. He couldn't stop thinking about her. He wanted to talk to her again, but he was afraid of making a fool of himself.
The next day, she came to eat lunch with her friend. She sat in the same seat as the previous day. This time, he didn't drop anything, and he was able to serve her without incident. He was relieved that she was still there.
Later that afternoon, she came in again. He served her and then waited until she was finished eating. He was nervous, but he knew he couldn't stay quiet anymore.",1093,-0.5530923383813912,-0.36083128985506835,-0.865275705980948,-0.5627751665679835,0.4929517705204099
176,R_2uPq9RNTRJeULuo,OUR_HOR_3,Horror,Ouroboros,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had two eyes. Its skin was white and covered in black veins that spread out under its eyes and across its cheeks.
""What do you want?"" I said, still trying to get my bearings after the nightmare.
The reflection just smiled at me. The smile was unsettling. It reminded me of a cat's. It was a tight smile, as if the mouth were too small for the teeth. I could tell it was happy to see me because it opened its mouth wider when it did.
I started to back away from the mirror and fell into it, knocking it off the vanity. The reflection stayed on the floor but didn't move. I walked around the mirror and picked it up. As I did, it moved a little farther out of my reach and stopped. When I was standing right in front of it, it still didn't move. I leaned closer to examine it and found a crack that ran all the way through the glass. When I turned around, it was gone.
I went to the kitchen to make some coffee and couldn't find my cup anywhere. I thought maybe I put it in the dishwasher but when I checked I saw it sitting on the counter where I left it. I grabbed it and made myself a cup. When I set the coffee mug down on the counter, the doorbell rang. I jumped and ran to the front door. When I looked outside, I saw a familiar car parked on the curb.
""Isabella,"" she said, pushing past me to get inside.
She had gotten so thin since the last time we'd seen each other. She must have lost twenty pounds. She had her hair cut shorter and dyed a dark color. I always liked her long blond hair.
""How did you know where I live?"" I asked, shutting the door behind her.
""Do I need a reason to visit an old friend?"" She sat at the kitchen table and patted the seat next to her. ""Come sit with me.""
""Are you okay, Isabella? You look terrible.""
""You don't look so good yourself, Mrs. Donovan,"" she said.
""I'm fine."" I started putting the groceries away while she sat there and watched me.
""We both need a break from our husbands.""
""What do you mean?""
""They're both dead,"" she said matter-of-factly.
I stopped what I was doing and just stood there staring at her. ""Dead?""
""Yes, both of them died in a car accident,"" she said, not looking at me as she spoke.
""Wait a minute. What do you mean 'both of them'? You said you had a husband.""
""Oh, yes, he was still alive when they crashed,"" she said.
I felt my heart begin to pound. My head began to spin like I was in one of those dreams where you feel as if you are running but can't seem to get anywhere.
""What are you talking about? Did you kill him too?""
She looked at me sharply with her brown eyes. ""Why would you think I killed him? I didn't do anything.""
""Oh, no! No!"" I said. ""I was just asking because you said you were married.""
""You're not making any sense.""
""No, I'm not,"" I replied. ""I'm having a nightmare. I must have fallen asleep last night and had a bad dream or something.""
""So, why are you sitting here in the kitchen with me? Shouldn't you be in bed?""
I started shaking my head. ""I don't know. Maybe I should.""
""Okay. If that's what you want. I'll let you go to sleep and we'll talk later.""
I turned toward the sink again to get back to what I was doing before she came in. Then it hit me. The mirror in the bedroom. I went over and looked into it and there was another woman looking back at me. I screamed out loud and fell backward onto the floor. Isabella ran in to see what was wrong. When she saw me, her face paled and she rushed over to me.
""Are you okay?"" She asked, putting her hands on my shoulders. ""Do you feel sick or anything?""
I shook my head. ""I think I'm going to pass out.""
She helped me sit up so I could drink some water.
""Where did you put my cup?"" I asked.
""Why, it's right here. You were drinking out of it when you woke up.""
""It's not mine. It doesn't belong to me."" I walked back over to the sink and put my hand against it. ""There's a woman's face inside this glass.""
""You're crazy. There isn't anyone else in here.""
I moved closer to the mirror and put my ear up to it. I could still hear Isabella's voice. ""Go back to bed, dear.""
""I can't do that,"" I said. ""The glass is cracked. Look. The crack runs through the glass.""
I reached out and touched the mirror. As I did, the woman disappeared. ""There. She's gone. But she was in here before.""
Isabella stared at the mirror in shock for a minute before speaking.
""Did you see what was in there?"" she asked.
I just nodded. I couldn't bring myself to tell her.
""Well, let's get you back to bed then."" Isabella picked up my cup from the counter where it had fallen and carried it with her as we left.
I was in the bathroom washing my face when Isabella came in. ""So, did you see who was in there?""
""No,"" I said. ""I don't think so. It must have been a trick of the light or something.""
She walked over to the sink and started brushing her teeth. ""Maybe I should get another cup for you tomorrow,"" she said.
""It wasn't my cup. It belongs to the woman in the mirror.""
She stopped what she was doing. ""You really believe there's someone in there?""
I looked at her sharply. ""Why not? It's the only thing that makes sense. And why would I be having bad dreams all of a sudden if there weren't someone else here?""
Isabella stood there looking at me as she finished brushing her teeth. When she finally spoke, her voice was low and soft.
""The dream was just a bad one. You know that, right? It doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. I promise you that.""",1105,-0.8621672925591881,0.11193988890144856,0.5261967245665564,0.9937275659988184,0.12985469262440158
177,R_2wgxO0QtEUHIhRA,MOR_HF_5,High Fantasy,Morpho,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""The village of Alpina,"" said the man. ""I am told there is a manor house here as well. If you wish to make your way there, I will guide you.""
""Thank you,"" said Rhys.
""We will take you to a place of safety,"" added the man. ""You will be safe there.""
Rhys followed him through the village and then out onto a long, straight road that ran along the shore of the lake. They arrived at a large building that had once been a manor house, but was now falling apart. The roofs had fallen in and much of the wood had rotted. The man led them into the building and left them in front of a set of heavy wooden double doors that stood partially open to the sky. Rhys heard something inside and then the door was closed behind him and locked. He was alone in the abandoned manor house.
""Is this where I am to stay?"" he whispered to himself.
He looked around. A large open room lay before him, with a stone floor and a few crumbling chairs and tables scattered about. There were long windows on one side of the room, and he could see the sun reflecting off the lake beyond. The room was empty except for him.
""I guess I'll be spending my time here,"" he said aloud, ""until someone comes to get me.""
He sat down in one of the chairs and laid his pack down at his feet. There was a fire pit in one corner, with a small heap of wood next to it. He could see a few other doors leading off in different directions, but none were open. The only sounds he could hear were those of birds calling outside and the distant sound of the river as it flowed through the valley below.
""Well,"" he said out loud, ""at least I won't be bored.""
""You have come to take my life,"" said a voice he hadn't heard in many years, ""and with that, your own as well.""
Rhys looked up but saw no one standing in front of him. He got to his feet and looked around but saw no one there either. He walked around the room but saw no one there either. He stood on one side of the room and looked down at his feet, but no one stood there either. He walked over to the other side and looked down at his feet again, but still saw no one there.
""Who are you?"" he called out. ""Where did you come from?""
There was no reply. Rhys went over to one of the doors and tried it but it wouldn't open. He stepped back and tried another but it wouldn't open either. He stepped back and tried another door, then another, and another, but none of them would open for him.
""What are you doing?"" asked the voice again. ""You cannot hide from me.""
Rhys stepped over to the fire pit and pulled some wood out of it and then walked over to another door and tried to open it but it wouldn't move for him. He walked back over to the fire pit and put some more wood on it and then walked back over to another door and tried to open it but it wouldn't move for him either.
""Why won't you let me out?"" he asked as he walked back over to the fire pit and put more wood on it again.
He walked back over to the last door he had tried and pulled it open, but still saw no one there but himself. He stepped back over to the fire pit and put more wood on it just in case someone else came along, then walked back over to the last door he had tried before this one and tried to open it again but it wouldn't move for him either.
""Who are you?"" asked Rhys again, this time more urgently as he tried each door again just in case some other person might be hiding inside them now that he had come this far into the room. When none opened for him, he dropped his hands to his sides where they hung at his sides and waited for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first.
""Why won't you let me out?"" he asked again once more as he stood there waiting for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first. ""Why can't I get out of here?""
Still no one came, though he was sure others were hiding inside all the doors now that he had come this far into their trap. Still he waited, knowing there was no escape now except death itself, except that death would not end his torment if no one else came along before he did so himself. But still no one came....
""Why won't you let me out?"" asked Rhys again as he stood there waiting for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first....

Rhys woke up with a start as something slammed into his back with such force that it knocked him forward onto his knees on top of his pack and sent him crashing headlong into an unmoving wall behind him with such force that it knocked most of his teeth loose from his jaw and sent them scattering across the floor at his feet with such force that it left him momentarily stunned with pain as his head spun around from being struck with such force that it knocked out several dozen teeth from his jaw with such force that it left him momentarily stunned with pain....

178,R_DSF4svKOilKX6qB,OUR_HR_5,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He didn't recognize her at first, but the more she spoke with that beautiful voice, the more he knew.
""You have to be joking me,"" he said out loud.
She laughed in response, an echo of his thoughts. ""You should probably not speak so loud.""
His blood boiled at her words as if they were her own, even though he'd never heard them before. They had a strange ring to them, as if she had grown up with the same accent. His skin crawled under her scrutiny. His body tightened like a bowstring drawn back to its peak tension. The moment was over in seconds and she went about her business, leaving him without any idea what had just happened.
He got off work early that day, thinking it might be best to spend the evening in solitude, away from her. He bought a bottle of wine, then went down to the dock to watch the sunset. He drank slowly and listened to the gentle sounds of the ocean until the sky darkened, turning orange and red as it did every night. But for some reason, this time, he found himself staring at the horizon instead of the water. When it finally seemed he couldn't stand anymore, he set his glass on the rail and leaned over, his eyes closed, and reached out with his mind.
A moment later, her voice whispered into his head, sharp as the bite of a needle. ""I think you're going to regret coming here.""
The words echoed over and over in his thoughts, punctuating each thought. ""You're going to regret coming here.""
He opened his eyes and stared at the horizon. What he saw there was not the beautiful, fiery sun going down in the west. It was something else, a creature of the night. As it rose and stretched toward the sky, its mouth opening wide in a yawn, he felt a deep sadness, like something died inside of him. A terrible feeling of loss. It was a void he felt he could never fill. And yet, he knew that if he let go, he would be free to join her. To find her.
He looked back over his shoulder and saw her standing there. He took a step back in fear and surprise.
""You shouldn't look so scared. I'm not going to hurt you. But you're going to have to come with me. I won't be able to stop myself anymore.""
He wasn't sure if she were talking to him or to himself, but she turned and walked away, the way she had come. He stood rooted to the spot, his mind trying to make sense of what just happened.
The next day, he went into town and bought several items—a sleeping bag, some food, and a few other things. After he checked out, he returned to his room and set up his little camp on the edge of the woods. He wanted to get a feel for the land and the sea before he headed into the mountains.
It was a dark and dreary night as he made his way down to the dock, then across it onto the small boat he'd rented. The sea was calm, almost like glass, and the stars glittered brightly overhead. He kept to himself and stayed in the middle of the boat, far from the prow where he could keep an eye on the water. When he reached the cove where he'd seen her last night, he didn't see any signs of life, not even a single starfish washed up on the shore.
After making his way south, he finally came upon a small, uninhabited island that he believed he would have to travel through. As he neared it, he began to hear strange sounds echoing in the distance, as if someone were playing a flute. He stopped and listened for a long while, until he realized that it was actually two people playing the same tune. He found a secluded spot, sat on a log, and listened as the music echoed through the trees. He thought of the young woman who had left the tavern, how her words had stung him like a slap across the face, and he felt his anger begin to bubble over. He pushed it down, though, determined that he would not let her take control of his emotions. He did not want to be anything like her.
After what seemed a very long time, the two musicians finished their song and turned to walk away. But they did not leave the island. Instead, they walked right past him. He watched as they disappeared into the forest. He was alone on the shore of the island.
The next morning, he took off into the woods and followed the narrow path that led up a steep hill toward the mountain range. It took him a good part of the day to make his way up the side of the cliff. The path was not always well marked. When he found some sort of cairn that looked like a headstone, he knew it must mark a grave. He didn't think that many people came to this island, but there was no way of knowing how old it might be.
As he approached the top of the cliff, he saw a village at the foot of the mountains. He continued to follow the trail upward until he reached a clearing at the end. The sun had started to set, leaving a deep blue color in the sky and the sea, like ink spilled on parchment paper. His eyes searched for the woman from the tavern and he felt a strange, familiar sense of dread when he realized she wasn't there. But he'd thought that before. He stood frozen in place, afraid that if he moved forward he would see her standing in front of him, and yet, at the same time, he knew he must move on.
He wandered through the village, noting the small huts built into the ground and the large one he guessed to be the church. In the center of the village was what appeared to be a common area where all the villagers gathered for their daily lives—washing clothes and cooking over small fires. He watched them as they went about their business, but no one paid him any mind. Not even when he sat down on the ground with his back against a tree, still feeling lost and alone.
At that moment, a strange, unsettling thought came to him. What if the girl he'd seen in the tavern was really here, after all? She had mentioned the mountains. And he was on an island.
""That's crazy,"" he said aloud.
But it was just as crazy to think that he hadn't seen her before, or that he wouldn't run across her again. He sighed heavily, then got up from the ground and headed out of town. As he made his way across the open plain of the island, he heard the sound of a flute once again. He followed the sound until he found a young woman sitting on the edge of the cliff, playing her flute.
When she noticed him, she smiled and stood up. ""I've been waiting for you.""
""Waiting for me?""
""Yes. You promised you would come to me one day.",1262,1.8102742989690643,-0.19751705864046623,1.090753032753765,1.4426334102435951,1.742727109552542
179,R_26c19tKFzv2EaMu,GEN_HOR_4,Horror,Genesis,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The face had no eyes or nose, just two large holes for its mouth and ears. It smiled at me. I screamed in fright as it vanished. I ran over to my parents' room and knocked on their door before running back here. I sat down on the edge of my bed with my knees pulled close to my chest. My heart was racing so fast that I felt like it would explode any second now.
I could only imagine what this thing wanted from me. How did it even get into our house? And why is it still here when my parents are awake? What am I going to do if they wake up and see it too? Maybe I should call the police or something. That's an option right? I picked up my phone off my nightstand and tried to dial nine-one-one but I couldn't seem to get my finger to move. I tried calling it three more times but each time the same thing happened. I looked at the screen of my phone, hoping to find something that would give me some answers but all I saw were numbers and letters.
""What's wrong?"" Sarah asked as she opened her bedroom door. ""Are you okay?""
""Yes,"" I replied, trying to sound calm. ""Just had a bad dream.""
""Me too,"" she said, walking over to my bed. She leaned against the headboard and placed her hand on my leg. ""It was pretty scary. But I'm glad you're feeling better. You know, that thing gave me the creeps.""
""Yeah,"" I replied.
She looked down at my phone and then back at me.
""Didn't you say your phone wasn't working?""
""It isn't,"" I lied.
""Maybe we can call someone else instead?""
I turned away from her and grabbed the phone. I looked at the screen again and realized my fingers weren't moving anymore either. I tried to shake them but nothing was happening. Then I remembered where I was, and how I'd gotten here. I looked around my room to make sure everything was okay. When I saw the bed not made up and the covers thrown across the floor, my stomach dropped.
""Sarah,"" I called out.
She didn't respond so I stood up and walked towards her. There was no response. I reached out and touched her shoulder. It felt cold. I quickly let go of her and backed away. Her eyes were open and staring at mine. I felt myself start to panic as I looked down at her. Something wasn't right.
""Sarah!"" I cried out again.
Her eyes rolled back into her head and she fell backwards onto the floor. I rushed over and saw her lying unconscious. I looked around frantically for anything that might help. I spotted a book on her desk. I took it and brought it over to her. I flipped through the pages and found what I needed.
""911,"" I whispered to myself.
I pressed the buttons on the side of the phone and held it up to my ear. When I heard a voice I started to scream. I hung up the phone and threw it against the wall. Tears began to fill my eyes. I turned around to look at Sarah. She was still unconscious.
The monster was gone but now I had another problem. What should I do with Sarah? Should I try to take her somewhere safe or leave her alone until morning? If I left her here, who knew what would happen to her. I didn't want to think about it. I decided to check her pulse to be sure she was alive. I lifted up her wrist and felt it, checking for a heartbeat. As soon as I touched her arm, Sarah opened her eyes. I gasped as I stood back up.
""Where did you come from?"" I asked.
""I don't know,"" she answered. ""But I promise you I won't hurt you. I came inside because I was afraid you might be in trouble.""
""You were?""
""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come in without asking.""
""No, that's not what I meant,"" I said, wiping away tears. ""How did you get in here?""
""I snuck in,"" she explained. ""I didn't want to wake you up by knocking. I thought I could find the source of the noise and fix it before anyone woke up.""
""That's really nice of you, Sarah. But I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.""
""Okay,"" she replied. ""As long as you're sure, that's good enough for me.""
After checking on Sarah, I got dressed and went downstairs. I ate breakfast while my parents watched TV. They seemed to forget about the incident last night. I finished my meal and went to my room. I decided to turn on my computer so I could finally check my email. When I logged in, I noticed a new message at the top of my inbox. I clicked on it and read it.
Subject: Re: Hello
From: ********@gmail.com
To: ************
Hi! I saw your name online and figured I'd write you. I haven't seen you since we graduated. Are you doing alright? I hope so. You seemed pretty upset after graduation. I understand if you don't remember me. I was one of the quiet ones. We never really talked much. Anyway, I'm trying to reach out to everyone from our class. I thought maybe you could help me out. Do you happen to know where I could find ************? I've been searching for him for quite a while now.
If you do happen to know where he is, please tell him I'm looking for him.
I hope to hear from you very soon.
Sincerely,
Your Friend,

PS: I'm attaching my picture so you'll know it's me. I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you last year. I had to move away shortly after graduating. If you need any information about me, feel free to ask.
""Hello?"" I said aloud, wondering who the message had come from. I scanned through the rest of the email.

180,R_2tKkvcFSgNgGI53,LOW_HSF_4,Hard Sci-Fi,Low Rider,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. That meant only one thing. Winter would be coming soon. In fact, winter had already begun back on Earth; there would be snow on the ground by now if we were still there. Still, even though it wasn't as cold here, winter came every year just like it did down below.
It didn't take long until I arrived at the main building on site where we had been stationed for nearly eight months. We'd lived in an old military base that had originally been built to house soldiers during wartime. Now, however, it served mostly as an administration center. Inside, I found myself surrounded by people wearing uniforms—some of them wearing NASA ones, others belonging to various branches of the UN Space Force. All of us looked busy with our tasks, but there were always plenty of people standing around waiting for something or someone. As I approached the reception area, an older man with white hair noticed me approaching. He got up from his desk and walked towards me, extending his hand.
""Mr. Jones? The president himself asked us to give this to you personally."" His face broke out into a wide smile, revealing teeth stained yellow by cigarettes. ""The president would like to speak with you as soon as possible. Is three o'clock okay?""
I nodded before accepting the letter. ""Sure. Just let me grab my things and then we'll head over.""
He waved goodbye before returning to his chair behind the counter and resuming work. It took about fifteen minutes for me to collect all of my belongings and put everything away inside my bag. By the time I was ready, another man had appeared next to me. He was a bit younger than me, with a neatly trimmed beard and brown eyes that reminded me of the sea.
""You must be Mr. Jones?"" he said. I gave him a small nod and he extended his hand towards me. ""My name is Colonel Davenport. I'm a representative of the President of Earth and Mars. You may call me 'John.' May I ask what your connection with the president is?""
""We're both ex-astronauts,"" I answered immediately. ""He's actually the one who sent us to Mars to start with.""
He smiled. ""Ah, yes, I heard about you two being sent down here after the failure of Project Blue. Well, I'm glad to hear you've been doing so well.""
""Yeah, it's definitely turned out better than expected. Although, if they ever figure out how to send humans into space, we'll probably be back.""
""Well, I can say I don't envy you guys anymore."" He chuckled and I could tell he was trying to make light of the situation. I laughed along with him. We shook hands again before parting ways.
When we reached the presidential offices, I followed John down several halls lined with portraits of the previous presidents of Mars. They looked serious in their pictures, but the one we were heading towards was smiling widely and holding a big book in his arms. It was hard to tell exactly which president he represented because he looked young, and I couldn't quite see any distinguishing features that might have helped to identify him. When we finally reached the end of the corridor, he gestured towards a set of double doors made of steel plates and told me to go in first. I did so and found myself standing in front of an oval window, looking out onto the city of New York. There were people walking around everywhere, but not enough to fill the streets. A few cars drove by, but none of them stopped near the road to let anyone on or off. Instead, everyone just used the elevated rails to get wherever they needed to go.
""Hello again, Mr. Jones,"" said a familiar voice, startling me. ""It's nice to see you again after all this time. Please, come inside.""
A tall man in a white robe emerged from behind the glass window, waving to me as he spoke. I hadn't seen him since I left Earth almost ten years ago. Then again, I hadn't gone back to visit my parents either.
""How are you?"" I asked as he approached me.
""I'm fine, thank you,"" he responded. ""Please, come inside.""
Once I crossed the threshold, we sat down across a table covered by a blue cloth, each of us having our own seat. He handed me the letter he had given me earlier and I opened it to read. It said simply: ""I hope things are going well for you in your new home.""
""So far so good. I'm really enjoying it here.""
""That's great news,"" he replied. ""As I'm sure you know, this isn't always the case. We usually don't have anyone leave Earth and find a place here on Mars, although it happens more frequently than most people think. What do you mean when you say 'it happens more frequently than people think?'""
""Well, there was this one guy—""
""—who went missing after he left Earth,"" interrupted the president. ""Didn't you hear about it?""
""Not really,"" I admitted. ""I didn't really pay attention to the news.""
""Oh, right. I forgot you haven't been following it closely since you've been on Mars. Anyway, the reason we're having this meeting is that we'd like to invite you to return home. It's time for you to go back.""
I stared at him blankly for a moment before realizing he was serious. My mouth hung open and I felt my cheeks grow hot as I looked away from him. This could not be happening! After all these years, he wanted me to go home? ""Why?"" I managed to utter at last. ""What about you? Aren't you supposed to stay here until your term ends?""
""Yes, but that doesn't change anything for you, does it?"" he replied. ""If I want to return to Earth, it won't stop you from staying here, will it?""
I thought about it for a moment while I chewed on my lip. ""No… I suppose it wouldn't.""
""Then it looks like the decision is out of my hands."" He smiled. ""Although, I still don't know why you never told anyone where you were planning to go when you left Earth.""
I shrugged. ""You know how it goes. Things happen unexpectedly. Besides, there was nothing wrong with leaving Earth to live on Mars.""
""You're right about that, but we would have been much better prepared to deal with you if we knew where you were.""
""But you did anyway, didn't you?""
""I sent you messages telling you to contact us if you ever needed help."" He nodded. ""We should have done more to keep tabs on you when you were here too, but no one expected you to become an astronaut in the first place. We didn't even know that astronauts existed until you showed up, after all.""",1212,0.5660184804785598,2.000470951065597,1.6961683972127506,1.3739919256041495,1.8617322518432158
181,R_2tsy3OoBKpxSlyJ,BAS_HF_6,High Fantasy,Basic Coherence,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""I wonder if anyone lives here,"" said Alusair as she peered down at the town below them. ""It's so quiet.""
""We'll soon find out,"" replied her brother. He pointed toward the nearest tower. ""That one is ours.""
Alusair nodded and took off running across the field. She jumped onto the wall surrounding the village and began scaling it with ease, using only her hands and feet. As she neared the top, she heard a shout behind her.
""Stop!""
She turned around to see a man pointing an arrow at her. His face was covered by his hooded cloak, but he had long hair that fell past his shoulders. There were also several other men behind him carrying bows and swords. They stood just outside the walls of the village, waiting for someone to come out.
""What do you want?"" asked Alusair.
The man lowered his bow slightly and spoke in a voice that seemed to echo inside his hood. ""You are trespassing. Leave now or we will have no choice but to kill you.""
Alusair laughed. ""Oh? And what makes you think I'd leave?""
The man did not answer. Instead, he raised his bow higher and drew back the string.
""Do you know who I am?"" asked Alusair.
He hesitated before answering. ""No. But I'm sure your father does.""
""And my name is Alusair,"" she said. ""But I don't think you've ever seen me before.""
""Perhaps you should go home then,"" suggested the man. ""Or perhaps you would rather die?""
Alusair smiled. ""I wouldn't mind dying, but I'd prefer to live first.""
A look of fear came over the man's face. ""You're a witch! You must be killed!""
""Is that right?"" she asked, raising her sword. ""Then let us settle this once and for all.""
With a loud cry, Alusair charged forward. Her sword flashed out in front of her, and the tip sliced through the air where the man's head had been moments earlier. The man dropped his bow and ran away.
Alusair stared after him for a moment, wondering how such a thing could happen. Then she looked down at her hand. She saw blood dripping from the blade and realized why.
""Gods above!"" she cried, dropping her sword and falling to her knees.
Her brother rushed over to help her up. ""Are you hurt?"" he asked.
""I... I'm fine,"" she replied. ""Just a little cut.""
She wiped the blood from her sword on her tunic and handed it to her brother. ""Here, take this. I need to get cleaned up.""
He took the sword and bowed deeply. ""Thank you, sister.""
Alusair smiled. ""Don't thank me yet. We still haven't won.""
""Yes,"" agreed her brother. ""But we have the advantage now. Let's go inside and see what our new home looks like.""
They walked through the gate and entered the village. The buildings were made of wood and stone, and there were many thatched roofs scattered throughout the place. Most of the people were gathered in the center of the settlement, which consisted of a large square surrounded by houses. In the middle of the square was a well, and beside it was a wooden platform upon which sat a statue of a woman holding a staff.
As they approached, Alusair noticed something strange about the statue. She bent down and touched the base of the staff. It was cold to the touch.
""This is ice!"" she exclaimed.
""I thought it might be,"" answered her brother. ""I guess that explains the snow.""
""Snow?""
""There is a mountain range not far from here. I believe it is called the Mountains of Ice.""
Alusair looked around the village again. ""I wonder if anyone else is living here. Perhaps we can ask them.""
""Let's find out,"" said her brother.
They went to the edge of the square and began speaking with the villagers. No one was willing to talk to them, though, and they left without learning anything more than what they already knew.
""Well, that didn't work,"" said Alusair.
""Maybe we should try the next village over,"" suggested her brother.
""Why don't we wait until nightfall and sneak in then?""
""Good idea.""
They returned to the inn and spent the rest of the day resting. When the sun started to set, they decided to make their way to the second village.
They found it easily enough. It was much larger than the first, and there were even more people gathered in the square. As they watched, a group of men carried a casket out of the building and placed it on the platform. The statue of the woman rose from her seat and began walking toward the coffin.
""What is going on?"" asked Alusair.
""I don't know,"" replied her brother. ""But whatever it is, I hope we aren't late.""
They followed the procession out of the village and down the road toward the mountains. The closer they got, the colder it became, and the snow grew thicker. Soon, the ground was covered by a layer of white.
""Where are we?"" asked Alusair.
""In the Mountains of Ice,"" answered her brother. ""I suppose that answers your question.""
The procession stopped at the foot of the mountain. The men lifted the lid of the casket and pulled out a body wrapped in cloth. They laid it gently on the ground and began chanting.
""What are they doing?"" asked Alusair.
""I don't know, but I think they're preparing the dead for burial.""
""Burial? What kind of people are these?""
""I'm not sure, but I think they may be witches.""
""Witches?""
""Yes. From what I've read, they worship the gods of death and darkness.""
Alusair frowned. ""That doesn't sound very nice.""
""No, it isn't.""
After the ceremony, the men closed the casket and carried it back to the village. The statue of the woman stood up and walked toward the mountain.
""So that's how they live,"" said Alusair. ""I never imagined they would be so different from us.""
""It's not too surprising, I suppose,"" replied her brother. ""We've lived under the rule of the empire for generations, while they have been free to practice their own beliefs.",1097,0.9880564309050721,0.3813841749364897,-0.41630179100808123,0.30938840772211285,0.16902571695595003
182,R_1LTp56JxtjMC3tD,GEN_HR_8,Historical Romance,Genesis,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been staring out the window, hoping to catch the eye of a passing woman. It didn't matter that it would only have been for an instant before they passed by. Her face was pale and slender as a blade, with high cheekbones and small lips. His eyes were immediately drawn to her sharp nose and the way it curved up slightly when she smiled. But then her hair caught his attention. The sun had just set and there wasn't much light left in the room but he could see every subtle shade from blonde to brown to black. When she looked at him with those green eyes, it seemed as though they glowed with their own inner fire. That was how she made him feel—as if everything in the world was illuminated by a brilliant flame.
When she walked away from the table without ordering anything, he couldn't think straight. He felt a strange stirring inside his chest and wondered what had happened to him. As he watched her leave, he realized with amazement that he hadn't even thought about eating or drinking since she arrived.
He never did get to find out what color her eyes were because she had slipped away before he could ask.
Over the next few days, he tried to go through the motions of life, trying not to dwell on her. But nothing else in the world mattered to him except the memory of her. Whenever he passed a mirror, he stared into it, hoping to see more of her in himself than he already possessed. In his dreams, he often awoke sweating and gasping for breath after having visions of her standing naked above him, a knife in her hand. He'd wake trembling and with a terrible longing to be back in that dream again so he could lose himself in her eyes and her smile.
After three days of this, he decided that if he wanted to know more about her, he would have to do something bolder. So on the fourth night, he went to the tavern and waited until she came in. The moment he spotted her, he rushed over to where she was sitting and asked if she needed any help. She looked surprised at first but then laughed. ""No,"" she said, smiling up at him. ""I'm fine.""
It was the beginning of a wonderful friendship. They spent most of their time together talking about everything under the sun. Over the next several weeks, they discovered that they enjoyed many of the same things: music, books, and art. But there was another thing they shared in common, too.
They both had secrets. And they both found each other's secret comforting.
One evening, as they were walking along the riverbank, she told him about her mother. ""My father is an honest man but my mother is a thief.""
""How can you say that?"" he protested. ""She looks like a lady.""
""And I look like an orphan, don't I? My mother has been stealing since I was born. She started with small things and now she does bigger ones. Sometimes she steals food and sometimes she steals money.""
He frowned. ""But why?""
""Because she likes what she's doing. Because she feels good when she takes something from someone who has it.""
""That doesn't sound very nice,"" he said.
""It isn't. But that's what makes her happy.""
His stomach turned over at the thought of her mother taking things from people who needed them. He looked down at the ground and kicked a stone with his foot. ""Why should she do such a thing?""
""Because she wants to,"" she said simply. ""And because she knows that I won't tell anyone.""
For some reason, the idea that he would ever betray her made her feel safe. She knew that he would always keep her secret. ""Do you hate your mother?"" she asked.
""Not really. At least not anymore. I used to when I was younger.""
""Why?""
""I guess it was because she hurt me. By the time I realized that she was hurting others, it was too late. I couldn't figure out how to stop her.""
Her voice trembled as she added, ""I wish I could have stopped her sooner.""
""You're a strong girl,"" he said. ""Strong enough to run away from home.""
She looked at him curiously. ""What are you saying?""
""I mean that if you want to, you could leave this place and travel to other cities. You might find a better life if you did.""
""Oh, yes,"" she agreed quickly. ""I've been thinking about that a lot lately.""
""Then why don't you leave?"" he asked.
She sighed. ""I haven't told my mother yet, you see.""
""Why not?""
""I don't know. I'm afraid that she will lock me in a room and starve me to death.""
He laughed. ""That's a silly thing to worry about. If she locked you in a room, all you would have to do is break down the door.""
She shook her head. ""No. Not if she had a big key. And I wouldn't be able to do that anyway. I have no strength.""
""Of course you do. Don't you remember what I taught you? All it takes is focus.""
""Yes, but I don't want to use my magic unless I absolutely have to. Especially not against her. It would hurt her feelings.""
""Well, then, you'll need to have a plan.""
""A plan?""
""Yes. Your mother will probably try to stop you. So you must be ready to fight. Or else you won't have a chance.""
""Don't you think that if I ran away, she would follow me?""
He shrugged. ""Maybe she would. Maybe she wouldn't.""
""But if she did, what would happen to me?""
""I don't know,"" he admitted. ""We'd just have to see what happens.""
She nodded, and her expression was one of determination. ""All right. We'll see what we can do.""
They walked along the riverbank, talking about plans to leave their lives behind and start over in a new place. He loved the way that she sounded when she talked. Even though her words were simple and straightforward, he always felt as though he understood what she meant.
As he reached out to touch her arm, she pulled away. ""Let's walk faster,"" she said. ""Otherwise, we'll miss our train.""
The next morning, she took him to her house and showed him around. He could hardly believe how beautiful it was. There was a garden filled with flowers. An old oak tree stood in the yard, its branches reaching out to cover the entire area. The house itself was tall and elegant, with many windows that let in the sunlight.",1154,-0.22715353584066983,0.6127851879259958,0.18545566141769343,0.9939098895468345,0.558406869186458
183,R_1ODK2SqagAi56Tr,OUR_HOR_5,Horror,Ouroboros,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was one of the kids I went to school with.
""Hello,"" he said, his voice high-pitched and distorted. ""I'm here for you.""
As if I didn't know that already. ""No thanks. I don't need any company tonight,"" I said as I turned away.
The little bastard grabbed my arm. I screamed in pain. Then, like I'd done it to myself, I reached into my chest and pulled out my heart. My right arm got caught in the mirror and fell to the ground. The little bastard's smile faded when my heart flew toward him. He reached for it, but it disappeared before he could grab it.
I kept screaming and beating my own body until blood started coming from everywhere. The pain was terrible, but it felt like a relief compared to being awake and looking in the mirror at him. I fell down to my knees in front of the mirror, still crying, and closed my eyes. I wished I could go back to sleep and never wake up again.
""Don't worry,"" a soft voice said. ""You're not alone anymore. We'll protect you from everything that's been hurting you since you were born.""
A hand came out from behind me and gently patted my head. I stopped crying and looked up at the girl. She was beautiful with dark, wavy hair that reached the middle of her back, hazel eyes, and creamy white skin. She had the body of a goddess, with the kind of curves I couldn't stop staring at even when she was wearing sweatpants. She wore a purple dress and her breasts were covered by a lacy corset. When she moved, they bounced and swayed beneath the thin material.
She held out a red rose to me. ""The thorn is only on the outside,"" she said. ""Inside, the flower is very pretty.""
""I don't want a bloody rose,"" I said. I started to stand, but a sharp pain shot through my chest. I grabbed it with one hand and opened my mouth to scream.
""It's okay, Chris. You just lost your heart for a little while. It will come back soon enough,"" the girl said.
I stood back up, and she pulled me into a tight hug. Her breasts were pushing against my chest as our lips met. Then I heard something hit the floor.
""You've made him yours now, little sister,"" someone said. ""He's ours.""
I looked around, trying to see who the voice belonged to.
""Give me Chris. I want to give him his new heart,"" the boy said. ""He'll be mine now.""
My eyes darted toward the mirror and the boy was standing in the reflection. He took out a knife and cut a long piece of fabric off the top of his own body. My heart flew out and into the little bastard's hands.
""Now you belong to me!"" he yelled as I fell down to the ground, my heart still in his hands.
When I woke up again, there was nothing but blackness. I reached out for it and felt my hand go through the air. Then I saw a dark shadow in front of me. A dark shadow with purple eyes that reflected my own. The shadow leaned over me and placed its cold lips on my ear.
""Why won't you let me help you?"" it said. ""You know I love you.""
Then it went away, leaving me alone.
I started crying again when I realized what had happened. I kept screaming until my throat hurt so much I couldn't cry anymore. Then I noticed that the sound was coming from the ceiling. I got up and walked toward it. When I looked inside the attic, I found the kids. They were in an old barn filled with hay and straw. Some of them had already taken human form and were sucking the blood out of their victims.
They looked like the kid that killed me, except they didn't have my heart and his clothes weren't torn up. They were dressed in black with white collars. One of them took a bite out of someone's neck. The victim screamed and tried to run away, but a few of them held him down. He didn't see the shadow standing behind him because it was still in a human form.
I pulled out a dagger and started stabbing everyone in the face. When one of them grabbed my arm, I stabbed him in the chest. His heart came flying toward me, and I caught it before he could escape. I cut my right arm off and handed the heart to the shadow. It took a long drag from the heart and turned into a wolf. It growled at me and ran off with his new heart.
I fell down and covered my ears as the sound of thousands of heartbeats started coming from the barn. I felt a tear running down my cheek. I couldn't stop it no matter how hard I tried. I didn't want to live with this heart anymore. It was making me insane.
The crying stopped when I heard footsteps outside. When I looked up, the girl was standing there. She was wearing a white dress and her hair was down. I wiped the tear from my face.
""How did you get in here?"" I asked.
She smiled at me. ""You're my Chris,"" she said. ""I can come wherever I want. Come on, let's go home.""
We started walking toward the house. It was huge, just like the one in the movies. The moon was full, and the stars were twinkling behind it. They reflected in the pond of water that sat in front of the house. I stared at it for a moment, amazed by its beauty.
When we got closer to it, I saw someone sitting next to the pond. They were beautiful like the girl I knew, but their face was hidden. My heart started beating faster as I stood in front of them.
""Can I help you?"" she asked.
""Yes,"" I said, my voice trembling. ""I want to go back to sleep.""
She took my hand and led me through the trees. I could feel her presence all around me. We got to a large door in the ground. She put the heart inside a small hole and closed it. Then she opened the door and started walking down the stairs. When we got to the bottom, I heard someone else's heart beating inside of me. I grabbed the girl by her wrist and pulled her down.
""Don't worry, Chris. This is what you've been waiting for,"" she whispered.
When I woke up, I was in bed again.",1164,-0.7150214124006579,0.015190980630949563,0.39188645068453914,-0.28850033191232305,-0.32978094659702706
184,R_32Q7Q1gdrJvf49Q,GEN_HSF_5,Hard Sci-Fi,Genesis,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. Our solar panels could easily produce enough energy to keep us going even without direct sunlight, but if we wanted to save power, we had to stay inside as much as possible during the summer months.
The walk to work only took about ten minutes, which gave me plenty of time to think about what I would say when the president asked why it took so long for us to find a second habitable planet. The truth was that I hadn't really considered that there might be others who were looking for an Earth 2.0, or whatever they called their version of our world. But now that he mentioned it, we did have some competition. Of course, the other planets weren't exactly easy to spot from orbit, but the chances were good that someone else was searching for them too.
But that was all hypothetical. There was no way anyone could know about these other worlds until one of us discovered them first. Right? That's what I kept telling myself, anyway. My thoughts turned back to the president's letter. The more I thought about it, the less confident I felt that we should tell him anything at all about any of this. I mean, I didn't even know where the hell we were sitting on this new planet. All we knew about it was that it orbited around a star in the constellation Monoceros, and that was the extent of the information we had received from the probe.
So what if there is another civilization living on some other world? Did we really want to admit that we were capable of such a feat? I couldn't help thinking about my own life—all the things I had given up just to come here to this planet. And not only was I giving up on everything back home, but also the potential for a future with my girlfriend. No, there was no way I would ever let him know we found another world.
As I continued through town, I noticed that people seemed unusually busy. Everyone was hurrying to get places, and as I approached the presidential palace, I saw that the crowds outside were thicker than usual. When I finally made it to the front, I found the area completely blocked off by metal barricades. Two soldiers standing on either side looked at me curiously, but neither of them spoke to me. They just pointed toward a nearby staircase leading downward.
A sign above the entrance to the stairs read ""Presidential Office."" As I reached the bottom, I passed several armed guards wearing purple uniforms. One of them glanced at me as I walked past, but said nothing. The rest of the guards were focused on keeping the crowd moving forward. In some ways, it reminded me of rush hour at Chicago O'Hare Airport, except this was more like rush hour in Times Square on New Year's Eve.
I tried to make my way through the crowd of people, but I quickly became overwhelmed. Every few steps, I'd hear the shrill sound of a siren from somewhere behind me, followed by the sound of gunfire. Before I knew it, I was trapped against the wall of a building as bullets ricocheted off the stone below me. For a moment, I thought that maybe I should run and try to get away from it all—to somehow escape this madness. But then I realized that any attempt at escape would probably end badly, whether that meant getting shot or simply running into something else.
My mind flashed back to when I was in high school. I was playing basketball in gym class, when one of the guys on the other team dove for the ball, trying to block my shot. But as soon as he pushed me, I fell backward onto the floor of the court. His knee came down hard on my chest, and the next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. But while I was laying there, confused and dazed, I heard the nurse saying, ""You're lucky you didn't break anything. Your heart stopped beating, but luckily one of your classmates saved your life.""
Suddenly, I realized that my situation wasn't much different. I had been pushed back against the wall, and now it was up to me to figure out how to keep myself alive. So I braced myself against the cold stone, clenched my fists, and waited for the gunfire to stop.
After a few seconds, the shooting abruptly ended, and I heard footsteps approaching. A familiar voice shouted, ""Get back! Stay down!""
When I turned to see who it was, I saw a tall man in a blue uniform pointing a gun directly at me. He yelled again, ""Stay there! Don't move or I'll shoot!""
I froze, unable to speak.
At last, the man lowered his weapon and moved closer to me, pulling his face mask down to reveal a pair of dark eyes. As he got close enough to talk, I could smell the faint scent of alcohol on his breath. ""What are you doing here?"" he asked.
I hesitated, not sure how much I should tell him. But before I could answer, he shook his head and said, ""Never mind. You can't afford to know the answer to that question. Keep walking.""
As he led me away, I saw that he was carrying a large black bag. I wondered what kind of equipment he was carrying. After all, it wouldn't make sense for him to bring weapons out here if he didn't need them.
We slowly approached the edge of the crowd, and when we were able to get by the barricade, he pushed me forward. He looked back at me and said, ""You've got one chance to live, and I'm not going to waste it on explaining anything to you. Just follow my orders and do exactly what I say, otherwise you're dead. Understood?""
I nodded silently.
He smiled and said, ""Good. Now listen closely. We don't have much time, so pay attention.""
He pulled out a small device and pressed a button on it. In response, a series of red lights lit up on its surface. Then he pointed it at the ground and said, ""There. See that rock there? Go ahead and pick it up. Make sure you don't drop it.""
For a moment, I was still frozen in place, wondering what the hell he was talking about. But once I started moving, I realized that he must have brought a camera along with him. He was probably using it to take pictures of the crowd so that his superiors could better understand what was happening here.
Soon, I found myself holding a rock. I looked at it for a moment, then turned back to the man, unsure of what to do next.
""Just walk over to that guy over there,"" he said. ""Walk right up to him and give him the rock. Then turn around and go straight back to the start. Got it?""
I nodded once more. He pressed another button on the device, and two of the red lights began flashing. Then he said, ""Go.""
I stood there for a moment longer, taking in the sights around me.",1273,-1.3816907274710464,-0.37602572387276273,1.218234905141792,-0.39705596924870906,-0.10065250289988807

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The light was harsh, but the air was warm, so it was actually pleasant. I pulled up my sunglasses as I headed down the steps and walked across the street toward the main administration building for the Mars Base.
""Good morning, Commander,"" said the secretary behind the desk. ""Are you here to see the president?""
""Yes, I am,"" I replied. She opened the door and led me through a series of rooms and hallways until we arrived at the president's office. We were alone.
""Mr. President, good to see you again,"" I said. He was sitting behind his desk, looking at a large screen on which he was reading something.
""You too, Commander,"" he said. ""So, what is this all about?""
""I've been sent here from Earth,"" I said. ""To tell you that your daughter has been found alive.""
The president's eyes lit up and he smiled. ""How?"" he asked, his voice filled with joy. ""Where is she?""
""She's alive and well, but she needs help. There was an accident that injured her leg and damaged her arm. She's being treated in the medical facility right now.""
""How badly are these injuries? Will she be able to walk again?""
""We're not sure yet,"" I said. ""Her doctors will be able to give us better information once she wakes up.""
""Can I speak to her?""
""No,"" I replied. ""I'm sorry, Mr. President. The doctors have told me that it's not safe to let her hear your voice right now.""
""Then why am I here?"" he asked. ""Why can't you tell me where she is?""
""I don't know, Mr. President,"" I replied. ""All I know is that she's alive. She was in a shipwreck on her way to Mars, so there are people who want to kidnap her.""
""That doesn't make sense,"" he said. ""If someone wanted to take her from us, they would have done so by now. The only reason anyone would keep her hidden is if she were sick or injured, and we've seen no sign of that.""
""She is not sick, sir,"" I said. ""The doctors have checked her thoroughly. But I don't know why they are keeping her hidden. I'm not even certain how long she has been there, and I don't have any more information about the ship that brought her here.""
""So you don't know anything else,"" said the president, leaning forward over his desk. ""Not even if she's being held against her will?""
""No, sir. I'm sorry, but that is all I have to tell you. If you wish to speak to the doctors, then I suggest you go down to the medical center yourself and talk with them. I am sure they would be happy to speak to you.""
""Fine, Commander,"" he said. He looked at me for a moment before standing up and walking around his desk to shake my hand. ""Thank you for bringing this news to me.""
""It is good to see you again, Mr. President,"" I said, shaking his hand as well. Then he turned and left the room, and I followed him out of the door. We walked through the building and back into the sunshine of the courtyard.
""How is your daughter?"" he asked.
""She's fine, sir,"" I said. ""But she's still being held against her will by whoever took her. The doctors think it's possible that she could wake up at any time and start asking questions about where she is, so they're keeping her in a deep sleep until that happens. When she does wake up, I'm sure they will be able to let us know more about what is going on.""
""I'm glad to hear that she is well, Commander,"" he said. ""What are your plans now?""
""Well, I was just heading back to my apartment to grab a bite to eat,"" I replied. ""Then I'll probably come back here to work on some paperwork that needs to be done.""
""Sounds good,"" he said. ""I'll see you later.""
And with that, he headed toward his car, which was parked in the courtyard. As he climbed into the driver's seat, he looked over at me and waved. I returned the wave and started to walk away. But then he spoke again.
""Commander?""
I turned back to face him, and he leaned down to get a better look at my face. ""Yes?""
""I just wanted to thank you,"" he said. ""We were all very worried when we heard about what happened to your family. But you have done a great job of handling the situation and making sure everyone knew how to keep them safe."" He shook his head. ""Thank you, Commander.""
He closed the door, and I watched as he drove away. Then I turned and walked back across the street, entering the administration building for the Mars Base once again. Once inside, I headed down the hallway until I reached the elevator. I pushed the button to go up to the third floor, where my apartment was located. I took a few moments to check my messages and emails on my phone, but there wasn't much to see. Just some reports from my officers, telling me about the progress we were making with the construction of our new facilities. Then I got out of my uniform and went to change clothes. I was going to grab a bite to eat and then come back here to work for the rest of the day.
When the elevator finally arrived at the third floor, I stepped out into the hallway and headed down the long corridor to my apartment. I unlocked the door, and then I stepped inside and closed the door behind me. My heart was pounding with excitement at the news that I had just received. I couldn't wait to get back to my office and tell the others the good news about my daughter.
But before I could do anything else, I needed to make myself something to eat. I headed toward the kitchen and pulled out the fridge. Inside it were two bottles of water and some leftover food from lunch yesterday. I took the bottle of water and opened it, taking a big drink. Then I grabbed the package of chicken from the freezer and put it in a pan that I heated up in the oven. After a few minutes, the chicken was ready, so I took it out and sliced it up on a plate. Then I ate a couple of pieces and washed them down with the last of the water.
After I finished eating, I went back into the living room and sat down on the couch. I was feeling tired, but at the same time, I couldn't wait to tell everyone that I had been told my daughter was alive and well. But before I could do that, I needed to take care of some paperwork first. I would have to call in an extra staff member to help me sort through all of the requests and reports that had piled up while I'd been gone.",1242,0.9076983340617066,1.6727099633191582,-0.6723810314672408,-0.5963896605142458,-0.5887652275692433
186,R_3e7W3RXcOttLkgy,OUR_HF_2,High Fantasy,Ouroboros,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""A few more minutes."" Jaxi had been silent since she'd spoken during the ride. ""I'm still not certain that this is our destination, but I am getting closer. But we're here, so I'll stop trying."" She sank into silence again as they stopped the wagons beside a stream next to a small bridge. ""At least for now.""
""Well, what do you expect us to do?"" Ryl asked, taking several steps down onto the grassy bank. ""We're not exactly dressed for an outing into town.""
Jaxi's response was silence. They waited until it grew dark before continuing. Ryl could have used the power of the stones to see in the dark, but he didn't think the others would appreciate it too much if he walked around wearing them.
""It doesn't seem like anyone has noticed us,"" Yuliana said, looking up toward the towers. ""Hopefully we can just walk around the village and then head back."" She started moving forward.
Ryl shook his head and followed after her. As they made their way past a few homes, he took note of the people who passed by them. There were about three dozen that they saw while walking through the village. Most ignored them and kept going. A few gave the group curious looks but continued on their way without saying anything.
After about half an hour of wandering, they found what appeared to be the center of the town with an open area surrounded by several shops and buildings. The only one that seemed to be occupied was a store in front of the area. The owner was inside behind the counter. He stood and came out when Ryl and the others walked into the shop.
""Ah, you must be new in town."" The man wore a heavy cloak with the hood pulled up over his face. His eyes were hidden from view by the folds of his coat. ""You are welcome here. It's been a long time since there was anyone to visit the village, but we've managed to stay busy. I'm Gorgus. You can call me Gorgus, though most do shorten it to Gruc. Come in, come in. Can I get you something to eat or drink? There's a little bar back in the corner there if you'd like a cold ale.""
""We're not really looking for food or drink,"" Jaxi said. ""I'm more interested in learning about what has happened here and who lives here now.""
""I don't know anything about that."" Gorgus turned toward a cabinet behind him. ""There is some news. We have a few travelers that stopped in yesterday."" He turned back to them with a wooden tray in his hands. ""Would you like some bread, cheese, or smoked sausage?""
Ryl and Yuliana exchanged glances. They both shook their heads no. ""No, thank you,"" Ryl replied.
Gorgus laughed as he returned the tray to the cabinet. ""Not hungry?""
""Just a little peckish, that's all,"" Ryl replied, shaking his head.
""Well, there's something wrong if you're hungry after eating a whole dinner at the feast,"" Gorgus chuckled. ""I'll let you know about the travelers later then. If you'd like to see inside, there are a couple of chairs over by the fire if you want to take your time and talk. Or if you'd rather just sit outside and eat, I can bring out a couple of fresh-baked rolls. It's a lovely evening tonight. A little cooler than usual, but still good.""
""Do you mind if we eat and drink outside?"" Ryl asked, motioning for the others to follow him as he led them away from the shop and toward the front of the buildings.
""Of course not."" Gorgus smiled. ""I was going to do that anyway. The weather is nice, and I think you've probably earned a break from being cooped up in these wagons. I don't have a lot to offer, but my bread is always fresh.""
They settled onto a wooden bench in a small park on the edge of the village, taking a moment to take in the sounds and sights around them. The wind had picked up some since they'd arrived at the lake. The clouds had blown away, leaving only a few puffy white wisps dancing in the sky above the mountains. Ryl couldn't help but admire the view as the setting sun painted the mountains a vivid shade of gold. He felt Jaxi settle into the back of his head.
""That was a lot faster than I would have expected,"" Ryl said, smiling as he watched Yuliana pick off pieces of sausage and cheese and devour them in one bite.
""What do you mean?"" She looked up at him.
""Jaxi didn't take nearly this long to find what she wanted here.""
Yuliana shrugged as she chewed her food. ""There hasn't been much to discover. I've already spent hours searching every building in town for any mention of what has happened to the people here.""
""This place seems perfectly fine,"" Ryl said, taking a swig from the water skin he held in one hand. ""It looks like someone just left it all behind without telling anyone else.""
""I'm afraid that may not be the case,"" Gorgus said from a short distance away.
Ryl and the others turned to look at him. He walked over with a smile on his face, his hands tucked inside his sleeves.
""The people who lived here were slaughtered and their bodies disposed of by their own children. They thought they'd lost everything when a demon attacked the village. Their only hope of survival was to hide in a small cavern. It is here that they stayed for three days. When they emerged, there was nothing left of their home or the surrounding villages.""
""Why didn't we notice anything?"" Ryl asked. ""Or better yet, why did no one come back after that? There can't be so many people out in the world that could just leave behind a whole town without a word.""
Gorgus sighed as he leaned against the fence nearby. ""We have an infestation problem here. It has been happening for the past few years, but the demons are becoming more organized and aggressive now. They use whatever means necessary to kill their prey, so there is very little left after they've finished with it. The best way to fight them is to drive them out of a region before they can settle in. That is what the city guards in the city do when they aren't fighting other cities, so I expect that they will continue to try and keep these creatures from moving in, just as we're trying to do here. But we don't have much manpower. If something happens, then there is not enough left to help those that are caught by the demons.""
Yuliana nodded. ""It does explain why the people here seem to be gone though.",1220,1.772979725541172,1.9586925744646684,1.0751183613730475,1.3919139832700191,1.6850012039101998

A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""We'll have to camp here until morning,"" Dorn said after he had walked around the town once to check for signs that anyone lived there. ""I don't want us walking into something we can't handle.""
Aranthur nodded. There was nothing to see except buildings made mostly of wood and mud-brick walls that were crumbling, and there was no sign of people living there. He felt very nervous as he followed Dorn back to the river bank and started packing down their blankets and bedrolls. The others did not seem surprised by anything that happened. They just took everything as it came—and then they settled down to sleep in a circle around the fire that they had made earlier.
Aranthur lay awake watching the shadows dance across the clearing as the flames flickered. The night was warm and dry, but it seemed cold after so long under the sun, which was already sinking towards the western horizon. His head hurt too. He could not help wondering why they had come here; he would never have chosen this place for himself even if it meant saving his life. He wondered what it was that he had missed, what had gone wrong, what he should have done.
Then he slept.
Aranthur woke to the sound of voices. He opened his eyes slowly and looked at the faces hovering above him. The fire was dying down, but he could still make out the faces. It was early evening and there was mist rising off the lake and curling into the trees like smoke, obscuring the view.
Dorn sat on one side of him while Yalain and Aranthur's brother stood on the other side.
""What is going on?"" Aranthur asked, yawning. ""Why are you all looking at me?""
Yalain and her son exchanged glances. ""It was your idea to come here,"" Yalain said. She sounded very tired.
""So I hear. You're welcome to tell me now.""
""There's something in the water,"" Dorn said. ""Something in the air, maybe.""
He pointed towards the lake, where there was a little boat tied up at the dock. The mists had gathered more thickly around it and a breeze had blown up, blowing it across the surface. The boat was covered with dust and cobwebs and was leaking from the seams.
Dorn got up and went to inspect the boat carefully. He pushed his hands into the holes where the oars used to be, checking inside the cabin area, poking his fingers deep into every hole he could find, until he had satisfied himself that the thing was seaworthy enough to be moved to deeper waters. He climbed into the bow and started paddling, pushing the vessel across the calm lake, where it floated without moving against the current. After some time, he turned the boat towards the shore and pulled it to a stop next to the dock. Then he climbed out again and helped Yalain and Aranthur climb aboard.
""Where are we going?"" Aranthur asked as he clambered over the gunwale and into the stern cabin.
""We don't know,"" Yalain answered him quietly. ""But I think we need to get into the water and look around.""
She sat down and put her feet on the floorboards below and leaned forward on her arms so she could stare into the water.
""This is strange,"" she muttered. Her eyes narrowed as she studied it intently.
Aranthur watched her for a while, but he could see nothing except for the ripples caused by their movement across the surface.
""I'm not sure this is a good idea,"" Aranthur said finally. ""I don't understand how it works, but it seems to me that this might be an evil place.""
Aranthur could not say exactly what was wrong with this place; it looked so peaceful, sitting in the misty dusk. But somehow it felt wrong to him, as if something bad lurked behind the mist and in the water, waiting to pounce on them.
""That's ridiculous,"" Yalain answered him.
""What do you mean?"" Aranthur said defensively. ""What makes you say that? What's going on here?""
""Nothing is going on, and if you ask me, we're being stupid.""
""How can you know that?""
She sighed heavily. ""Look at the boats,"" she said. ""All these tiny ones, like toys, floating on the surface of a great ocean. And this whole lake is like a mirror; whatever I am looking at, I am seeing reflected right back at me.""
""Well, I can't see anything but the lake, Yalain. I think maybe you should be more careful about making accusations that might turn out to be unfounded.""
""I don't accuse, I just say what I see."" She shrugged. ""And that's all I see."" She looked at Aranthur and smiled sadly. ""If you want to argue any more, just go ahead—but I warn you, I won't change my mind.""
""I wasn't arguing,"" Aranthur said, irritated. ""I just thought that we shouldn't be wandering around in places like this.""
""Like where?"" Yalain stared at him, her eyes narrowing. Then she laughed suddenly, a low laugh that sounded almost girlish, and she shook her head.
""Oh yes, Aranthur, you are a city boy, aren't you? Well, I have been away for quite some time, but I've seen cities too. And I promise you that if this place doesn't feel like the most peaceful spot in the world, then there's nothing that does.""
""Maybe so,"" Aranthur replied. ""But you should be cautious.""
""Yes, I guess I should."" She frowned slightly at him, and he realized that he must appear as nervous as he felt. ""Anyway, Dorn says there is something in the water.""
Aranthur glanced sideways at his brother. Dorn was standing by the bow, staring intently into the darkening lake.
""What sort of something?"" Aranthur asked.
""I don't know yet.""
""Are you planning to drink it?"" Yalain asked incredulously.
""I don't plan to do anything at all,"" Dorn replied evenly. He did not answer Yalain's question. Instead he reached into his belt pouch and took out a large glass bottle, stoppered tightly with a cork. When he twisted the stopper loose, a thin stream of water poured into the bottle, then stopped as abruptly as it started.

I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had two eyes and a mouth, but it wasn't human. It didn't even have a head or any arms. Just a torso that ended in what looked like a black mass of tentacles. ""Who are you?"" I said. The thing stared straight at me with its one eye. I could feel something crawling all over my skin. I tried to run away from the mirror, but I couldn't move at all. Then the creature spoke. ""You're dead,"" he said. ""You died yesterday."" He kept staring into my eyes for a few moments before saying anything else. Then I felt something cold touch my neck, and the last thing I knew was waking up next to my bed with my throat cut open.
—from ""The Man From Beyond""
It had been five days since we arrived in the town of Stull, and things were going pretty well. All three of us were staying at the local motel, which was a lot nicer than I expected it would be. It's only twenty dollars per night, so that was nice. We had our own room with two beds and everything. The bathroom was clean too, which was more than I could say for most places we've stayed at recently. My dad is usually pretty frugal when it comes to money, but when it came time to book this place he just wanted something cheap and reliable. I think it helped that he'd already paid for two nights when he made the reservation. After that, he told me, they wouldn't be able to refund him if he chose not to stay. So we were stuck here.
I spent most of the day today sitting outside in the parking lot across the street from the gas station that was right around the corner from the motel. There weren't many people around, so that was okay. My mom went inside to go do some shopping; I hadn't seen her since last night, although she did send my dad a text message to let him know where she was. She always does that. I'm kind of worried about her. I'm sure she's fine, but she doesn't strike me as the type to go off without telling anyone where she's going and who she's with. She never goes anywhere alone either. That might sound strange considering we don't really get along very well, but she still makes an effort to spend time with me. Not much, mind you... just enough that it seems like she cares.
I was watching the street through binoculars, waiting for someone to walk by wearing a hoodie like the ones they showed in the news report. But nobody did, and after an hour or so I decided to come back inside. I checked my phone, and I'd gotten a new message. It was from my mom.
Hey sweetie! Are you having fun? I'm sorry I haven't called yet, I forgot how long it takes for the phone to connect sometimes. It's been busy at work. But I'll see you tomorrow! Have a good day!
My mom works at a restaurant, and it was only seven o'clock when she sent me that message. She's not supposed to work until eight, but she said that there had been a lot of customers in lately. It must have been slow tonight if she's working this early. I replied that I was doing alright, and I hoped everything at work was going well.
She didn't reply immediately, but then she sent another text ten minutes later.
Oh yeah! The new menu's coming out soon, so that's exciting. I'm gonna try all of them! Ha ha.
There wasn't really any reason to write that, other than maybe to give herself something to talk about. And I know my mom's kind of quirky, but this isn't the usual stuff. Plus she always tries to make small talk like that, even with me. Usually about how much better her cooking is than my dad's. Or what kind of movies I like. I didn't really care though, so I just ignored the second text. I figured she'd just keep trying to chat with me like normal, so I left the phone in my pocket and went to take a nap.
I didn't dream at all, of course. My sleep was restless. I woke up a few times feeling like I needed to check the door, but each time I did I realized that the light outside was still the same as it had been the last time I checked. No cars were passing by, no footsteps or voices on the sidewalk. Nothing seemed to be happening out there at all, which was weird because I could hear the highway down below, and I'd expected it to be noisy with traffic. There was also the sound of people talking in the building above ours, but I couldn't tell exactly where they were. If there was anyone in our motel room, they were being quiet.
The rest of the day was uneventful. Mom texted me again before dinner to let me know that she was almost done shopping, so she didn't meet us for dinner. I guess it's a little awkward for us to eat together anyway... it's hard to talk to each other when we're both so stressed out. So I ate by myself. It turned out that it was actually pretty easy, since they only had one restaurant in town open. That meant they were short-staffed, so there wasn't anybody else around to bother me while I waited. I got to watch a show I'd recorded earlier, and then I went back to my room to get ready for bed. I took my phone out of my pocket and noticed that the text messages were gone.
It wasn't the first time my mom deleted a message without sending it, so I was used to it. It just annoyed me when she didn't explain why. I mean, what was the point of deleting them? What happened to the whole idea of transparency with her texts? She's always complaining about how bad the government is, but then she turns around and acts like she doesn't want anybody to know what she's texting me about. Like she doesn't want me to know her business, even if she doesn't mind showing it to everyone else.
After a few seconds I decided not to ask her about it again. I'd had a bad day, so I wanted to try to relax and get some sleep, and it's not like this was the first time she'd done something like this. Besides, I was probably getting paranoid. I put the phone back in my pocket and started to think about what I wanted to do tomorrow. Maybe I could find a way to sneak out and check the news.
But then I saw a flash of blue through my window. There was no one around, so I knew whatever it was couldn't be a person. I pulled up the binoculars to look out the window at the street below.",1231,0.8031320138184974,-1.4994462047317412,-2.40834248400076,0.32087045487591953,1.1792515772957508
189,R_23a6yJUO5DGDsaM,MOR_HSF_2,Hard Sci-Fi,Morpho,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I thought about the president while I walked down the stairs and onto the street, heading toward the center of town to meet up with my crew.
I had been a little nervous about going to the president's office when I got this message from Sato, but I knew that it was only because he had summoned us. I had been waiting for this moment for a long time. I had been trying to get the attention of all of the people on Mars, but that was impossible. The president was the only one with enough power to call me in.
""I'm sure that he's going to ask you about my research,"" Sato said as she followed me down the stairs and out of our apartment building. ""He is very interested in it.""
""I'll answer his questions,"" I replied, ""but I'm not going to tell him anything.""
""Why not?"" she asked. ""You've devoted your life to this.""
""It's not my research that he wants,"" I said. ""It's me.""
""What do you mean?"" she asked.
""It's a long story,"" I said. ""I'll tell you once we've met with him.""
""You do realize this means you won't be able to do your research here anymore, don't you?"" she asked. ""I'm surprised that you're willing to give up your project for a meeting with him."" It was clear that she wasn't happy about this.
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I've been waiting for a chance like this for a long time now. If it means I'll be able to go back to Earth, then I'm all for it.""
""What if he doesn't want you to go back to Earth?"" she asked. ""What if he wants to keep you here on Mars?""
""Then we'll figure out how to make it work,"" I said. ""I'm not going to let Earth get in the way of my work.""
""I hope you're right,"" she said. ""You've worked hard on your research and it would be a shame if it all went up in smoke now.""
""We'll figure something out,"" I replied. ""I promise.""
We continued on down the street toward town center and then turned right toward the main building where the president's office was located. There were no cars anywhere in sight and people walked everywhere—most of them in white lab coats like mine. We walked past a bunch of them heading toward the main building, which also housed the lab where I did most of my work and where Sato also worked. It was obvious that they were heading in there because they were all wearing protective goggles and carrying their bulky protective suits with them as they walked. I glanced over at Sato and saw that she was smiling and looking at me like she was proud of me or something. She probably thought that it would be a good thing for me to meet the president and have him see what I was working on, but she didn't know what he really wanted from me—and neither did I.
We finally arrived at the main building and walked into the lobby where we were greeted by a large security guard who looked like he could crush us like bugs with one hand if he wanted to—or at least give us a good scare. He wore a full-body suit of armor and a helmet that covered his face so we couldn't see his expression at all, but he watched us carefully as we walked into the main building and toward an elevator.
""You two are not allowed here,"" said a voice from above us as we got onto the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor. It was Dr. Sato's voice and it had an angry tone to it.
""Who are you?"" asked the security guard, still standing behind us.
""We're with Dr. Sato,"" I replied, feeling like I should have known who she was but not being able to remember her name right away. It was like she had been in my head and was reading my thoughts or something.
""Dr. Sato is not allowed in here,"" said Dr. Sato's voice again, sounding even more angry than before.
""Are you sure?"" asked the security guard, sounding even more suspicious now that he could hear her talking to us instead of just watching us from behind his helmet. ""Dr. Sato is one of our most promising researchers.""
""I'm aware of that,"" said Dr. Sato's voice from above us, sounding even angrier than before now that she was speaking to us directly instead of just inside my own head—which was where she had been before we got onto the elevator. ""I'm also aware that she is not allowed in here without your permission, so do not tell me she is one of our most promising researchers again.""
The elevator stopped on the third floor and we stepped off into a hallway lined with doors where Dr. Sato's voice continued to grow more and more angry with each passing second as we walked toward one of them at random instead of going back out into the lobby and getting back on another elevator to go back down to ground level again. The security guard tried to stop us but Dr. Sato continued to talk over him, even though we could hear her voice coming from inside her helmet now instead of inside my head like it had been before we got onto the elevator.
""I'm sorry,"" said the security guard as soon as we opened Dr. Sato's door and stepped inside her lab, ""but Dr. Sato is not allowed in here without my permission either.""
""You can't stop me from entering my own lab,"" said Dr. Sato's voice from behind her mask now instead of inside my head where it had been before, sounding even angrier than before now that we were actually hearing her speak directly to us instead of just hearing her thoughts in our heads—which was how she had been able to get into my head before this since she was wearing her own helmet while talking to me through it from behind me. ""It's my lab!""
""Then get out of it!"" yelled the security guard as he grabbed her suit with one hand and tried to pull her out of her lab while keeping his other hand on his gun so he could shoot us if we tried anything funny—or so he thought anyway since no one ever does anything funny when they find themselves being held up by a giant security guard who is pointing a gun at them unless they're really desperate for their own lives or something even more serious than that is going wrong and they're willing to do anything to gain their freedom again—which is exactly what happened next as Dr. Sato's helmet suddenly opened up like an umbrella and sprayed out a stream of liquid that shot toward his face just as he pulled her out of her suit by her arm and threw her through one of the lab doors as hard as he could—which knocked her unconscious before she could even turn around or scream out in pain or anger or anything like that since she had just been sprayed with a stream of liquid from a giant umbrella-shaped helmet while being held up by a security guard who was holding his gun toward her head—which means that she must have been really angry at him or something—but no one on Mars would ever admit that they were angry at another person unless they were really desperate for their own lives or something even more serious than that—which is exactly what happened next as Dr. Sato grabbed his gun with both hands and pointed it at him—which is exactly what happened next as I ran over to them both and punched him in his face as hard as I could—which knocked him unconscious before he could even react—which meant that Dr. Sato must have really been angry at him or something—which meant that Dr.",1405,-0.6136212777021087,-0.5842913912636739,-1.0151301234096444,-1.94363173571066,-0.7148364790428529
190,R_1K6y4S6OdmMmgJf,ALL_HF_2,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is it?"" Rasha asked as they approached. She had been expecting a castle or something similar, but this village was barely large enough to be called a hamlet.
""Yes,"" said Kari. ""I've heard that it used to be larger but has been slowly dying out over the years. This place may be empty, but there's probably an old wizard here somewhere who knows where the last two survivors are.""
""So what do we do now?"" Rasha asked, looking around.
Kari shrugged. ""We wait until nightfall, I guess. Hopefully, they'll come out of hiding when it's dark so we can sneak in and take them by surprise. But if not, then we just wait here for them to show themselves.""
""You have a plan,"" Rasha noted. ""How does that work?""
""It's not a very good plan,"" Kari admitted. ""But it's better than anything else we've got right now.""
""Do you think the dragon will come with us?"" Rasha asked.
""He already came once with us,"" Kari reminded her. ""That's why we're going back.""
""Then why do we need to go get him again?""
Kari sighed. ""I don't know, Rasha. All I know is that I have to do this, and I have to do it now. The longer I wait, the more people get killed. Maybe the dragons will just follow me into the forest or whatever. If not, then I'll find another way. I don't know what the rest of our group is planning, but I'm sure they've got some kind of backup plan, too.""
""And if they don't?""
""Then we all die together,"" Kari replied, her tone grim. ""At least I won't be alone when I do.""
The sun was nearly down before the village began to come alive. Kari could see lights flickering on in homes as well as hear the sounds of voices. She wasn't sure how many people were supposed to live here, but she didn't think it would be more than a couple dozen. It appeared that most of the buildings were one-story structures, which meant that the villagers probably weren't very wealthy. Kari looked around and saw no sign of life in any of them, though.
They sat down on the shoreline and waited, watching the sky for the telltale signs that the villagers had been alerted to their presence. As it drew closer to dark, Kari kept an eye out for dragons as well. She had to assume that the dragons were coming along, even if it was only to scout ahead for them. It was possible that they wouldn't attack at all, but Kari didn't like to take chances with these creatures.
As night fell and the stars came out, the village started to stir. Some of the buildings seemed to have lamps lit within, though it was hard to tell exactly what those were from a distance. A few of the lights were obviously magical in nature, but Kari didn't recognize them as being anything specific. She wondered if perhaps they were some of the same sort of magic that had helped her to find the dragon eggs and raise the hatchlings.
When they thought it was about time to make their move, Kari took Rasha's hand and led her back into the trees. The pair walked cautiously toward the village, keeping to the shadows so that they could approach unseen. After a couple hundred yards, they stopped and looked at each other.
""I don't know,"" Rasha said softly. ""If there are more than two people here, they're going to notice us.""
Kari shook her head. ""They won't see us. We just need to get close enough to talk to whoever is still here.""
Rasha nodded, looking at the village again. ""But what if we can't do that without being seen? You said yourself that they have magical light sources, right?""
""They do,"" Kari confirmed. ""But they can't be everywhere. If they've got someone in charge of security, then they're probably watching the towers at least. They'll be able to see us, but they won't hear us until we speak.""
Rasha frowned, looking worried. ""What if you're wrong?""
""Then we're dead,"" Kari replied simply.
They waited another minute before moving closer to the village again. Kari kept her senses open as she crept through the forest, searching for any sign of anyone else nearby. As soon as she felt safe, she moved ahead slowly, trying not to make any noise. Rasha followed suit, staying silent and alert.
After another couple minutes, Kari caught sight of a lantern in an upper window of one of the homes. She could tell from the glow that it was magical in nature, though she wasn't sure if it was something specific or if there were other magical lights scattered around. She hoped that the magical ones weren't on all the time, because that would draw attention to the village even faster.
She held her breath as she approached, and when she came up to the building, she crouched down behind a tree so that she could watch the window. A few moments later, the door opened, and two figures stepped outside. They didn't seem to be very old, which made Kari wonder if the village had been abandoned by younger people who wanted more adventure out in the world. The pair walked down the stairs leading to the shoreline, where they sat down together on a bench and began talking quietly.
Kari's heart sank a bit, because she knew that if she and Rasha didn't go back to get the dragon, they'd all die. She tried to focus on that thought as she watched them. She wanted to believe that the pair wouldn't have any reason to come out of hiding while it was still light, but she couldn't be certain of anything with these creatures. If they were going to attack the village, they might do it at any time.
The two were talking about something, but Kari couldn't make out what they were saying. After a minute or two, the man stood up and looked off toward the mountains. He turned to the woman and gestured to her. Kari didn't recognize their language, but it sounded like they were speaking the same tongue. When he turned to the tower again, Kari saw his hand gesture toward the sky.
He seemed to be pointing to the moon, so Kari watched carefully for a moment before she finally realized what was going on. It was only then that she noticed how much darker the sky was now, and she wondered if perhaps the stars weren't as visible from this far away as she had thought. The two walked down to the lake's edge and sat down together on the grass, staring out across the water. Kari could tell that they were talking again, but she couldn't understand any of it. She was surprised when the woman leaned in close and kissed the man, though.
They stood up after that, and he took her hand, leading her toward the shore.",1249,0.7964205732588063,0.5049891363209316,-0.8814854195554772,-0.8395213213840552,0.9384869395310748

I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my own face. I don't think it was a man's or woman's. I didn't have time to figure out what it was because the person in the mirror started yelling for help.
""Help me! Help me!"" it yelled as loud as it could. ""Please! Somebody, help me!"" The person in the mirror turned around and ran out of the room.
""Where are you going?"" I said as I went after him. ""Wait!"" He turned around and kept running. ""Why don't you come with me?"" He stopped but didn't answer.
""Please!"" I called again. ""What do you want me to do? How can I help?"" He turned around and looked at me.
""I'm dying,"" he said. ""The pain is unbearable."" He started shaking and crying. I tried to comfort him, but it didn't help. All I did was make the pain worse for him.
""It hurts so bad!"" he yelled as loud as he could. ""You have to help me!""
""I'm sorry,"" I told him. ""I can't do anything for you. You have to be strong and fight through the pain.""
""No, I can't anymore,"" he cried. ""Please, don't leave me like this."" He grabbed onto my shoulder and pulled himself closer to me. ""I need someone to save me!""
""Who are you talking to?"" I asked. ""You're scaring me.""
""I can't remember,"" he said. ""All I know is that I am in terrible pain. I just want it to stop!"" He started crying even harder.
""What happened to you?"" I asked. ""What's wrong? What are you doing here? Where do you live?""
""I don't know,"" he answered. ""I woke up and I couldn't move."" He started shaking. ""I was scared. I thought I was dying. Then, when I got up to look for help, I saw you.""
""Why did you try to get out of the house?"" I asked. ""You're not supposed to go outside.""
""I don't know,"" he said. ""I don't remember anything. All I know is that I am in terrible pain and I want it to stop!"" He started crying even harder.
""It doesn't matter why,"" I told him. ""You can't help yourself right now. It would only hurt more.""
""Please, I don't want to die,"" he cried. ""Don't let me die! Please, help me!""
""I'm sorry,"" I told him again. ""But there is nothing I can do to help you."" He looked at me with sad eyes. ""I can't save you."" He shook his head as hard as he could and then turned away from me.
""Please,"" he yelled. ""I don't want to die!"" I started to cry as well.
""What are you doing here?"" a man asked me. ""Who are you?"" The person who asked me was older than the last one. His skin was dark and he had short, curly hair. ""Where do you live?""
""I don't know,"" I answered. ""All I know is that I woke up in the mirror.""
""Then you have to come home with me,"" he said. ""We have to get you back to your parents.""
""I don't have parents anymore,"" I said. ""I don't even know where they are.""
""What do you mean?"" he asked. ""Your parents aren't dead!""
""They left me here,"" I told him. ""They abandoned me. I was too old for them to take care of so they just left me here.""
""You're lying!"" he yelled. ""That's not possible! Your mother wouldn't do that!""
""You don't know my mother,"" I said. ""She is an awful woman! She doesn't love me at all!""
""Why would she do that?"" he asked. ""What happened? What did you do to make her leave you here?""
""I didn't do anything,"" I said. ""She left because I am old enough to look after myself. Now she wants to pretend like I never existed. She is the worst mother in the whole world!"" I started crying again. ""She doesn't love me at all.""
""That's not true!"" he yelled. ""I know your mother. She loves you very much!""
""You don't know what you are talking about!"" I cried. ""She is the worst mother in the whole world!""
""Stop it,"" he said. ""You have to calm down before we go any further. We can't go anywhere until you stop crying.""
""I can't help it,"" I said. ""You don't understand! You don't know my mother!"" He took hold of my shoulders and tried to force me to calm down. It didn't work. All I could think about was my mother abandoning me. ""You don't understand!""
""Just stop crying for a little while,"" he told me. ""Let me try to help you."" I couldn't help myself. I kept crying until I fell asleep. When I woke up, I had a fever.

""A week ago,"" he answered. ""You must have caught it from someone else.""

The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It's not that big,"" Ransom said as he peered down at the town. ""I thought there'd be more people.""
Nathaniel shrugged. ""It is summertime, so most likely they've gone elsewhere to work the fields and tend to other business. They'll be back after harvest is complete.""
Ransom nodded then turned his gaze back to the lake. ""What about those ships?""
""I don't know. I'm sure we could try fishing one out if you want."" Nathaniel paused and looked away toward the mountains looming before them. ""But what do you think it means? Why would a ship have sailed up this far?""
""Maybe the sea isn't always calm, just like here.""
Nathaniel shook his head. ""There's nothing but desert here on the western side of the Great Desert. No landforms to create waves of any kind."" He looked at Ransom. ""If there were, why would anyone choose to live near it rather than in the city where it's safe? Besides, it's much too small for a large sailing vessel and there are no wharfs nearby.""
Ransom looked down at the small harbor town again. ""Then what?""
""Why else would they leave such a small island?""
Ransom frowned. ""I don't know. Maybe they're looking for something, or someone.""
""A new life maybe? That can't be the only reason to sail up here in the middle of nowhere.""
""I guess not.""
""Well, let's hope they aren't the enemy. If they are, we might find ourselves in trouble. And you should probably avoid talking too much while we're there until I know what's going on.""
Ransom nodded, though he doubted he'd ever stop chattering altogether. ""How will you know who they are?""
Nathaniel smiled. ""It'll be obvious when you see them.""
They continued along the shoreline for another ten minutes before reaching the end of the road which ran along the lakeshore. From there it was just a short walk down a gentle slope to the village. As they walked along the edge of the lake Ransom couldn't help but notice how blue it appeared even under the bright afternoon sun. The water looked clean enough, almost crystal clear. A large island stood offshore with many smaller ones dotting its surface. Most of these islands were small, barely half the size of a man. Others, however, reached nearly twenty feet in height and stretched off into the distance. Many of the larger islands were surrounded by dense woods and dotted with buildings made of stone. One had a tower sitting atop it, while several others had walls that appeared to have been built long ago.
At the very center of the lake was an island bigger than most. It rose from the water like a mountain with sheer cliffs that fell away sharply on all sides. On top of the highest peak was a large building, or perhaps more accurately a castle, of dark stone. The rest of the island was covered in forest and dotted with several small dwellings. There was also a large dock extending out onto the water where two boats were tied up.
""We've come far enough,"" Nathaniel said as they drew closer. ""Now I need you to keep quiet and stay hidden while we go ashore.""
Ransom didn't say anything and simply nodded his head.
As soon as they stepped onto the sand Ransom saw several men standing at attention near the entrance to the village. All wore armor and carried a variety of weapons ranging from swords to bows and quivers full of arrows slung across their backs.
""What do we do now?"" he asked softly.
""Wait,"" Nathaniel replied without looking back. ""And stay quiet.""
Several minutes later, as Ransom continued to stare intently out to sea, a group of people emerged from behind one of the houses. They wore similar clothing to the soldiers but instead of armor they were dressed in rough homespun cloth and carried spears and swords. They marched past Ransom and stopped near the soldiers, who immediately began speaking to them. When they were finished, one of the soldiers turned his attention to the others and gave a signal. Within seconds, all of the men dropped to one knee and began removing their helmets. The one in command came forward first, followed by a dozen others. Then, once they were in place, he spoke loudly so that everyone could hear him.
""All citizens, we have visitors who wish to speak with you."" His voice was gruff and deep, but still easy to understand. ""This is Captain Kale of the Royal Navy and his crew. They are here to offer assistance if you are willing to accept it.""
Ransom turned his head to look at Nathaniel. ""Is he talking to us?""
""Probably not. These people seem to be more interested in getting information from the soldiers than anyone else. You should probably stay close to me until we figure out what's going on.""
The captain walked over to them, leaving his men where they stood.
""Captain Kale,"" Nathaniel said. ""Welcome to our town. I assume you are here to help us.""
Kale shook his head. ""No. We are not here to fight the Dark Lord. That would be counterproductive and unwise. Instead, we are here because of a prophecy we have uncovered."" He gestured toward Nathaniel. ""He says he knows your true name, and I believe him.""
""That doesn't mean I'm going to tell you!"" Nathaniel replied sharply. ""Now get out of my way and let me deal with this.""
Kale frowned then nodded. ""Of course. But if you are willing, I will give you whatever aid you may require.""
""What exactly does that mean?"" Ransom asked.
""I intend to escort you through the Great Desert and to the city where you will be reunited with your family.""
Nathaniel sighed. ""We already know about the Dark Lord's army. What else is there to learn?""
""Yes, I suppose you're right. Still, you should consider allowing us to accompany you. I'm certain there are many things you don't know about your homeland.""
Ransom frowned. ""What makes you think we haven't traveled there before?""
The captain nodded then glanced at Nathaniel. ""It's not important now.""
He turned toward Ransom then. ""You should be aware that once we reach the desert, we cannot take prisoners. If you decide you don't wish to continue on, you must be prepared to leave immediately.""
Ransom took a step back in surprise. ""Are you serious? What kind of army takes prisoners?""
Kale stared at him for several seconds before responding. ""Your people are known throughout the world, so it stands to reason that the soldiers who serve them should be well trained and skilled in battle.""",1188,0.40911651529884,0.40590830700212716,0.3449662906356411,-1.0566556385294272,0.06895765480396147
193,R_0BbPdOex7whgaTD,GEN_HR_5,Historical Romance,Genesis,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been so busy with the customers that it had taken him almost ten minutes to notice she was there because he couldn't take his eyes off her.
He hadn't been able to figure out who she was until she spoke and it dawned on him that this was the same girl who'd been in here last night, asking about the innkeeper's wife. The woman he thought was dead. He'd assumed then that she must be related to the man, but now he knew better. How could he have made such an assumption? Why did everything keep coming back to that stupid tavern? So many things were going wrong for him lately—he needed something good to happen. Something really good. Like getting lucky tonight.
She'd sat down at the table, smiling as if she knew exactly what he wanted. God help him, why wasn't he able to stop thinking about her? He didn't even know her name or much else besides the fact that she looked like she should be playing a harp instead of sitting in a tavern, drinking ale. But as soon as they'd started talking, he realized that she seemed intelligent and not some simpleton. After all, she was obviously quite familiar with the area around their town. It wouldn't have surprised him to find out she was from London, which would make sense since she said she was traveling for a friend.
But he found himself wondering whether that meant she might be a witch. Some men in the village were convinced that witches were real, although no one had seen any proof. Still, every year on Samhain, more and more people were afraid of being attacked by witches. They believed them to be evil women who turned men into swine and ate babies. When he'd heard the story about how the woman had died, he hadn't been able to stop thinking about it. No matter how many times he tried, he just kept imagining that she was still alive and somehow managing to survive in the forest. Maybe he'd gone mad. That was probably what happened when you spent too long working in a tavern full of drunks. Or maybe it was something else altogether.
""Do you think she's really dead?"" he asked her, trying to change the subject before he embarrassed himself by saying anything else.
She frowned. ""I don't know.""
He nodded slowly, unable to take his eyes away from her. Her blonde hair fell over her shoulders and he wanted nothing more than to reach out and touch it. The way she moved made him think she was graceful. In fact, he wondered if she played the harp. Was he crazy? What kind of girl traveled alone?
She smiled again. ""You're staring,"" she whispered.
He blushed. ""Sorry.""
He'd never actually spoken to anyone other than the patrons at the tavern. He'd always been so shy he'd barely been able to order food without spilling it on himself. And now he was starting to talk to a beautiful woman? Who was he? It seemed unbelievable that someone like him could have the nerve to do such a thing.
""It's okay,"" she told him, reaching over to take his hand.
He was shocked by the feel of her fingers against his skin. He'd been thinking about touching her, but he'd never expected to actually accomplish it. Somehow, she'd managed to catch him completely off guard.
""Do you want to go somewhere private?"" she asked, looking up at him with her blue eyes.
His heart started pounding fast. What did she mean by that? Did she expect him to kiss her? He felt like he couldn't breathe, like something was pressing down on his chest.
""Yes!"" he blurted out, nodding quickly.
She smiled and stood up. ""Come on.""
""Where are we going?"" he asked, following after her.
""Just follow me,"" she replied, ducking through a door behind the bar and heading toward the rear of the building. It was dark in the hallway and he could only see her outline. A moment later, a light clicked on. He blinked several times, adjusting to the sudden brightness and realizing that there was another room beyond the one he'd entered.
After walking down a short flight of stairs, he came to a door that read ""Employees Only."" He stared at it in surprise, wondering what she was doing. Then he took hold of the handle and opened it.
The room was huge, almost as big as the tavern. There were rows and rows of shelves filled with jars. On the opposite wall, there was a large wooden tub and a couple of washbasins. Next to those, there was a small table with a candle on it.
""What is this place?"" he asked.
She grinned. ""This is my bathhouse.""
He looked around in amazement. This was an actual business! ""How often do people come here?"" he asked.
She shrugged. ""Every day.""
He turned to look at her. ""But...your house?""
""My father owns it,"" she explained, picking up a pitcher of water and pouring some into a basin.
""So you're rich,"" he said, staring at her. He couldn't believe he was standing in a place like this, talking to a girl like her.
Her smile widened. ""That's right. You'd better watch yourself, though. My brother is a bit of a bully.""
""A bully? Is he here now?""
She shook her head. ""No. He works during the day, but I'm sure he'll be home soon.""
He glanced around the room again. ""Why are you telling me all of this?""
She shrugged. ""Because I like you.""
""But..."" He paused, shaking his head. ""I don't understand. How can you like a stranger so much?""
""People say that I'm beautiful, but it doesn't matter how pretty you are if you aren't nice to others. If you act like a complete bitch, no one will ever want to spend time with you. All you have to do is show kindness to everyone, and they'll love you for it,"" she said, scrubbing her hands clean.
His mouth dropped open. ""You're like the most amazing person I've ever met!"" he exclaimed.
She laughed. ""Thanks. You're not half bad either.""
Then she reached out and grabbed his arm, pulling him closer to her. She leaned forward, and he froze, waiting to see if she was going to kiss him. Her lips brushed against his cheek, sending a shiver down his spine. Her sweet breath smelled like apples.
""Are you ready to get out of your clothes?"" she asked softly.
He nodded eagerly, suddenly overcome with lust. He was desperate to feel her soft skin against his own. He wanted to taste her lips and explore every inch of her body.",1159,0.23322341902782615,-0.04709303800976937,-0.08619652841492485,0.12992552229968893,0.19477902481303996

She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd smiled and nodded when she'd said her name to him, but she'd seemed to sense that he was unhappy. She'd smiled again, and this time he saw it. It had been a beautiful smile then, a smile of confidence and happiness.
Now, he was still a man who smiled, but not with confidence, and not with happiness.
He was still a handsome man with his dark hair and dark eyes, but his smile was all wrong. He didn't feel handsome anymore. He felt like a stranger in his own body.
He pulled on his shirt and stepped into his boots.
""I'm going out,"" he said to his wife.
""Where?""
""To talk to the town sergeant.""
""Are you going to the prison?"" she asked.
""Yes.""
She looked at him in silence for a moment, and then her lips parted into a smile. ""I think that's a good idea.""
He looked down at her, surprised, and felt the smile fall from his face.
""But—"" he began.
""I'm not angry,"" she said. ""I just wanted to get your attention.""
""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I was angry with myself—I should have been more careful.""
She shook her head and smiled at him again. ""No, you didn't do anything wrong.""
She put her hand on his arm and squeezed it gently. ""You need to get away from here, don't you?"" she asked him.
He nodded his head as he put on his coat.
""Don't worry about me,"" she said. ""I can look after myself.""
He took her hand and kissed it.
""You'll be careful?"" she asked.
He nodded again and headed out of their room. He passed through the main hall of the inn without looking at anyone else and then he walked down the stairs and out into the street. The cold air hit him like a fist, and for a moment, he felt like he'd been punched in the stomach. He leaned against the wall for a moment and tried to steady himself. His wife's words still echoed in his ears. He knew she was right, but he wasn't sure he was ready to deal with that yet.
The sergeant arrived while he was waiting outside the jail. The man looked at him for a moment, then he pulled open the door and stepped inside. The sergeant shut the door behind him and walked down the narrow hallway to another door at the end of it. He knocked once, then opened the door slowly and peered inside before stepping inside himself.
A man sat slumped against the wall in one of the cells, his hands cuffed behind his back and his feet shackled together. The man's eyes were closed and he didn't move as the sergeant spoke to him quietly in a low voice. The sergeant spoke again and shook his head as he stepped out of the room again. He closed the door behind him and locked it as he went to stand in front of the prisoner.
The man opened his eyes and looked up at him, his expression blank and empty. The sergeant nodded to him once before speaking again in a clear voice.
""I'm Sergeant John Brown, and I'm here to take you back to your new home,"" he said. ""If you cooperate with me, I'll make sure all your needs are taken care of.""
The man stared at him for a moment and then looked away. He didn't say anything, but after a moment, he nodded slowly to the sergeant as if this was what he wanted already—it was too much of an effort to speak or even move anymore, but he had enough energy left to nod his head once or twice as if to say that he agreed with everything that was being said to him.
The sergeant nodded back at him once more and turned away from him as if there was nothing more for him to say or do here. In truth, there wasn't anything else for him to do now except wait for someone else to arrive so they could leave together—there was no way out of this place for either of them now that they were in custody of the town watch. But there were two prisoners here now, so that meant there were two escorts needed to take them back to their new home. The sergeant turned to look at the other prisoner who sat slumped against the wall in front of him like an empty sack of clothes—the second prisoner didn't speak or even move as if all the life had been sucked out of him by being here in this cell—and then Sergeant John Brown turned around slowly and left this cell too.
The sergeant opened the door again and peered into another cell which held another prisoner slumped against the wall—this one was slightly older than the first prisoner they'd come across—and then Sergeant John Brown spoke quietly to him in a low voice as well as he stepped into the room and closed the door behind him again before locking it once more as he left this cell as well.
The man who sat slumped against the wall didn't move. His eyes were closed—he looked like death warmed over—and there was no sign of any life left in him as well as when Sergeant John Brown had first entered this room only minutes ago.",934,-0.37676073672742255,0.2079204215998425,-0.749271323692889,-0.56676244801496,-0.45558855519062835
195,R_2fkdzSDcF4EZEsc,GEN_HF_5,High Fantasy,Genesis,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It's an idyllic place,"" said Rufra. ""A perfect place for us to meet."" He waved his hand at the water. ""Can't you just feel that calmness?""
""I can see why they chose this spot,"" said Laith.
Rufra had decided to show them the way himself. He was pleased they were so willing to follow him and hoped he would not regret it later. He could have used one of his men, but if he did, they might ask questions about where he'd been. If he stayed ahead of them, then no one need know what had happened since he last saw them.
He walked down to the edge of the water, looking back at his warriors as they followed. They looked eager now, faces alight with excitement. Maybe it was because of what they'd seen in the hills outside the city, maybe it was because of Rufra himself. Either way, there was little doubt that they believed they were going to win this war.
""What do you think they'll be like?"" said Jula.
Laith made a face. ""I don't know. I've never met people who live in such a place. It seems almost magical.""
""We won't judge them by their surroundings,"" said Rufra. ""They will still be people, just like us. We are all the same under our skins. What we choose to reveal is another story.""
Jula nodded her agreement. She turned away and watched the villagers, hoping she could get a glimpse of the women who lived there.
""Do you really think the king will listen to us?"" said Laith.
Rufra smiled. ""Who knows? But he has to make decisions based on facts, not just stories told by people who want something. Will you tell me the truth about what happened to the man you killed?""
Laith shrugged. ""He was going to kill me. He tried first but missed. Then he went for my friends. I'm sorry, but it wasn't your fault. You couldn't have known. And even if you had seen it coming, how would you have stopped him? I wouldn't have.""
Rufra looked at him, trying to work out if Laith was telling the truth or whether he was hiding something. In the end, he decided it didn't matter. If his plan worked, he would soon enough be dead anyway.
""There's nothing we can do about it now,"" he said. ""Let's talk about other things. Did you catch anything last night?""
""Yes, thank you,"" said Laith and pointed to the fish laid out on the ground between them.
""I thought you only caught a few?""
""No, I caught more than that. There's no point giving you them though. You're too big. Besides, I ate them all myself. I am a growing boy after all.""
""You certainly look it,"" said Rufra, but he didn't say anything else. He felt uncomfortable asking Laith about his hunting prowess, but he needed the information.
Laith went on to explain how he'd used a spear to snare birds in flight, then caught fish with his hands. He'd also found a herd of sheep and, once he was sure they were alone, he'd run among them, knocking them over and trampling them until he'd killed several.
""So, I think we should go to the river and see what we can find there,"" said Rufra, glancing up at the towers above the village. He knew they had to meet King Lebannen at some point, but he couldn't see any obvious place to stand and wait. ""If the king doesn't come down to meet us, then we can try to sneak inside the tower. That will give us time to plan how to deal with him.""
""How does sneaking in sound to you?"" said Laith.
Rufra grinned. ""Come on then, let's go.""
Laith picked up the basket of fish and put it on top of the pack he was carrying.
Rufra glanced back at his warriors, and they moved quickly to form a line. They were a strange-looking group; tall for men, broad around the shoulders, well muscled arms, but short legs. Some had long hair tied back in a ponytail while others wore their hair loose. Their clothes were varied, some brightly coloured, others plain browns and greens.
When they reached the riverbank, Rufra stopped and stared at the water.
""Why are we stopping?"" said Laith. ""I thought we were going to steal something.""
""I thought we might,"" said Rufra, ""but I've changed my mind. I need to think.""
Laith looked at him curiously. ""About what?""
Rufra turned to him. ""If I'm going to die, then I want to take the best things with me, the ones that mean the most to me. First, I want these."" He picked up the bow, strung it, and then handed it to Laith. ""Then I want to take this."" He held out the sword. ""And finally, this."" He pulled the dagger from his belt. ""For me, those are the important things.""
Laith took the bow and the sword, and carried them both on his shoulder. The dagger Rufra slipped into his own belt.
""I know it's not very wise to carry weapons when we're meeting royalty,"" said Rufra. ""But I don't intend to surrender them.""
Laith laughed. ""Maybe you should tell the king that before he kills you. Perhaps you can trick him into thinking you're an ally. You know, 'Your Majesty' and all that. You can even offer him friendship and peace, although I doubt he'll believe you.""
Rufra shook his head. ""I don't want to fool him. I want to scare him. When he sees that I have friends, and that they mean him harm, he will come down to meet us. We'll make our plans then.""
Laith opened his mouth to speak again but Rufra placed a finger to his lips.
""Now, let's go.""
Rufra led them to the edge of the water. He was tempted to jump in, but he knew he'd never reach the other bank. Instead, he stepped onto a rock and looked into the water.
""Have you ever seen anything like this?"" he asked.
Laith shrugged. ""No. Is it safe to walk on the rocks?""
""Yes,"" said Rufra, ""it is. Don't worry. Do you know which direction we should go?""",1115,-0.7107617166344594,-0.4951995052246432,-0.4704121350417887,-0.2089185621558668,0.5701561385490975

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The president of the United States wanted me to see him. The idea of talking with him made my skin crawl. He'd been elected on a wave of populism, promising to bring jobs back to America. And while he hadn't been as successful at that as he might've hoped, he had succeeded at one thing: making enemies of all the people who worked for him.
As soon as I reached the lobby, I checked in with the security guard and took the elevator up to the president's floor. When I stepped out of the lift, I was greeted by a wall of people standing behind barricades, many of them carrying signs that said things like, ""We are not terrorists,"" and ""Stop the invasion.""
The guards were wearing riot gear, but I could tell they weren't planning to do much more than push the crowd back if necessary. They had the protesters penned up against the glass doors, which led into the building. As I approached, they began to chant, ""Out! Out!"" and ""Shame on you!""
I walked through the line and headed straight for the door leading to the president's office. A Secret Service agent stood in front of it, blocking my way.
""You can't go any further, sir,"" he said. ""This area is closed off.""
""I need to see the president,"" I told him.
He glanced at his watch. ""Sir, you have fifteen minutes.""
I took a step closer. ""That's not enough time. We need to talk now.""
The agent raised his baton and tapped it against his thigh. ""I'm afraid you're going to have to leave, sir. You'll be allowed back in once you're done with your meeting with the president.""
""No,"" I said. ""You have to let me through. He has something he needs to say to me.""
""Mr. President will speak to you after his meeting, sir."" The agent stepped forward, placing himself between me and the door. ""And if you don't leave now, we'll be forced to take you in by force.""
I clenched my fists. ""You wouldn't dare.""
The agent didn't respond as he pressed the button on the wall. ""Security to the president's office, please.""
I took a step forward and looked up at the man who'd been elected to lead the country. ""You're going to regret this.""
""Get out of here, Mr. Walker,"" the agent ordered, and then pushed me out of the way.
I turned around and started walking toward my car. Once I got there, I sat down in the driver's seat and stared out at the protesters gathered outside the building. I couldn't believe that I was going to lose my job over something that had nothing to do with me. It didn't matter how many people I talked to or how much I pleaded my case to the president, I'd never get a second chance to fix what I'd done.
I thought about going back inside and asking to see the president one last time before I left Mars forever, but the look on his face when he saw me would haunt me for the rest of my life.
I turned on the ignition and started driving away. There were so many things I wanted to say to him, so many questions I needed to ask. But I knew they'd never have an answer, no matter how much I begged or pleaded with him. And deep down, I was okay with that.
I drove out of the city and headed into the desert, where I could see the mountains rising up from behind them. The air felt fresh, the sun warm against my skin, and I breathed it in deeply, letting all my troubles wash away with every exhale.
I stopped the car at the side of the road, climbed out, and began walking toward the horizon, leaving Mars behind me for good.
I stood there in silence for a while, watching as the sun slowly sank below the horizon. The sky turned a bright pink and then orange before finally turning dark purple. Stars appeared in the heavens above me, and the wind picked up, blowing sand across my face.
I turned around and looked at the city once more, this time from far away, and felt a strange sense of relief wash over me. There were still people living there—a few thousand of them, anyway. I hoped they'd be safe until the war was over.
I got back in the car and drove toward the mountains, heading for a place where no one would find me. A place where I could finally start my new life.

197,R_2xWUZmtxQVtUjH9,OUR_HR_4,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her hair was black and unruly; her skin dark and sallow. But the eyes! Those green eyes had been like daggers. It was as if she knew everything about him, had heard the darkest of his secrets. The sight of her made him feel... dirty.
But as she was led up the gangplank by a sailor who called himself her husband, she looked so sad—so lost. Her expression seemed to say that she didn't want any part of what her life had become. He didn't blame her.
That first day, he watched her with an insatiable desire to know her better. When he was supposed to be working, he'd follow her from the kitchen where she washed dishes to the corner of the tavern, where she took a quick bath before bed. It was like he could see her through the windows, and even though the blinds were always closed, the room was illuminated by moonlight.
And she seemed to sense that he was watching her, too. When she walked out of the kitchen wearing her shift and the lace headpiece that her mother had made for her, she smiled at him shyly over her shoulder and said, ""Thank you again for helping me find work here."" Then she walked toward the door, never looking back, but there was something in her eyes, something almost pleading...
He knew she had no choice but to accept whatever her husband chose for her, so he did the only thing he could: he started paying attention to her, but not with his eyes or ears, no, he did it with his body. He made sure she knew that he noticed everything about her, every curve, every mark, every dimple in her face. And when he held her, he felt the tension in her body, the need that she kept hidden so well.
It wasn't enough for him to just watch her. He had to touch her as well. And when the opportunity arose, he took her. He held her and kissed her and fucked her, and the whole time, she gave herself to him willingly—or at least that's how he saw it.
The way she moaned in his arms was intoxicating, the way she arched into him, the way her breath hitched in her throat, the way her legs wrapped around his waist—it all fueled his desire. It made him wonder what else she would do if she knew he was the one who took her over and over again...
Then she stopped returning his letters, his cards, his gifts.
She never once told him why she couldn't talk to him anymore, she never sent a letter back saying that she didn't want to see him ever again. But after more than two months of silence, he'd given up all hope. So much time had passed that he felt like he could never make things right between them.
But then, just before the first snow, he received a note from her. In it, she thanked him again for the work he'd done on the house, and told him she'd be returning in three days' time. The last sentence caught his eye, though—she told him to take care of himself, because she wasn't sure when she'd return.
He wondered what had happened to change things so much. But she hadn't been specific, so there was no point in asking her questions. He was just glad that she'd written again, and he spent the next several days waiting for her with anticipation and dread.
When she came back, he'd been working in the tavern. He'd gone straight from bed to the bar to find her sitting alone at a table near the kitchen. She looked around nervously as he approached, but he only smiled and said, ""I'm so happy you've come home."" Then he reached out and touched her hand.
She stared at him with a guarded expression, but he thought he saw a hint of something else—a question, maybe?—in her eyes. It was enough. He wanted to hear whatever she had to say.
""You look tired,"" he said.
Her face fell as he spoke, and then she began to weep. The sight of her made his heart clench. He took her hand in his, then led her back to the room where they'd made love, and he held her while she cried into his chest. He told her he was sorry, that he'd thought he'd known what he wanted, but now that she was there with him, he didn't want her to leave again.
And when the tears subsided, she told him that she wanted to stay. That it was too easy for her to just disappear like this. He could see the pain in her face as she told him this. But he also saw that she felt trapped by her husband, and he knew that if he asked her to run away with him, she'd never do it. He understood why; the last thing she needed was to put herself in danger.
So he tried to help her as best he could. He did everything he could think of, and it wasn't long before she stopped crying, and started smiling. Soon, her energy returned. And she found work again in the tavern kitchen, where she helped prepare the food for the sailors who came through on their way to the islands, or back home. She made enough to take care of herself and her mother, so she was happy.
He was, too.
As time passed, the tavern became a safe haven for them both, a place they could be together without the worry of being caught. He cared for her, loved her, protected her. But that all came at a price...
In the spring, when she was still fifteen years old, she told him that she was pregnant with his baby.
That was when he knew what was coming—the end. But he couldn't stop the words from coming out of his mouth. ""It's not your fault, don't you dare blame yourself,"" he said.
She stared at him and nodded slowly. Then she hugged him and said, ""I know."" But he could see that she was struggling, and it tore him apart inside. He tried to comfort her, but she pushed away from him, and walked into the bedroom and closed the door behind her.
He was stunned by the turn of events, but there was nothing he could do about it, so he left her alone in the room until she emerged, hours later.
He saw right away that she looked different, different somehow... more mature, more beautiful than she'd ever been before. That night, after they had made love again, he thought that maybe she was just growing up and she would soon be leaving him. It would be her decision to go or stay. But now he didn't know how to react when she came out of the bathroom and climbed into bed with him, to let her know that he loved her, and would always love her.
And even though he told her this, he realized that it might not be enough. That maybe he needed to show her, in ways that would make her understand that he wanted her, that he wanted her forever...
He started touching her. He touched her arms and shoulders as she slept, and then, when she woke up, he took the opportunity to touch her more.",1279,-0.11138538386872177,0.9134019950806371,0.13502580278714907,0.20118044778712615,-0.13661086257938918
198,R_1dzruU2hpvfIfCd,ACE_HOR_1,Horror,Ace of Spade,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't mine or anyone I knew. The face was pale with long dark hair. A single tear fell down her cheek. ""Who are you?"" I asked. She didn't answer so I asked again, but she still didn't respond.
""What do you want? Why can't you talk?"" I asked. Her mouth opened and she started to scream.
A loud crash came from downstairs. My heart stopped beating when I heard my name being called. ""Bethany!"" I ran to the door and turned the knob. As soon as I did, I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I collapsed onto the floor and blacked out.
When I awoke, I was laying on top of an old oak desk. I sat up slowly, afraid that if I moved too quickly, I might pass out again. After several minutes, I finally stood up. I put my hand against the desk and found a piece of paper. I picked it up and read the words written there.
 Dear Bethany,
 If you're reading this, then either you've already gone crazy like I have, or you haven't yet. Either way, you'll never be normal again after seeing what I'm about to show you. This is your last warning. Don't open the door! If you don't listen to me, you will die. Your life is worth more than any amount of money. Please keep yourself safe and remember who's watching over you. You know who I am, but only by my voice. You mustn't tell anyone else what I have shown you. Not even your mother. Do not look behind you. There is something evil waiting for you there. I wish you luck.
 Love,
 Mama
There were no names signed beneath the message, just Mama's handwriting. I stared at the letter for several minutes before realizing I needed to get out of there. I had to leave before I saw anything else. I grabbed the door handle and pushed, but it wouldn't budge. I tried pushing harder, but nothing happened.
""Why won't you let me go?!"" I yelled, slamming my hands against the mirror.
The glass shattered with a loud crack. Shards flew everywhere, cutting my arms and legs. I screamed, falling backward and landing on my stomach. Blood dripped from the wounds on my legs.
I rolled over and saw a figure standing right above me. It took me a second to recognize it, but when I did, my heart skipped a beat. It was Mama. But she wasn't my mother anymore. All the color left her skin; instead, she was covered in blood. It oozed from every wound on her body. The stench made me gag. Her eyes were wide open, staring blankly into space. They reminded me of those dead fish I'd seen floating in the water once. Her teeth were stained red, showing where they'd been gnawed on.
She smiled, revealing her bloody gums. ""Come closer,"" she said, her voice coming out as a raspy whisper. ""It's time we met.""
My breath caught in my throat and I couldn't move. How could someone be alive without their soul? That's impossible!
Her lips pulled back from her teeth and she bared them at me. ""Do you see now why you need to stay away?"" she hissed.
I shook my head frantically, backing away from her. ""No...no, I don't understand. What are you talking about?""
""You cannot escape,"" she said, reaching out to grab me. ""This is all you deserve.""
I ran, stumbling through the hallway, tripping over broken pieces of glass. I kept running until I reached the front door. I threw it open and slammed it shut.
I ran around the house, searching for a car, but it was nowhere to be found. Then, I remembered Mama always drove a white Mercedes. I looked around the driveway, but didn't see one. I glanced inside the garage and spotted it. It was parked under a blue tarp, hiding the damage. I pulled the tarp off and climbed inside. The interior smelled of cigarette smoke, which I didn't mind. It calmed my nerves. I started the engine and backed out of the driveway, heading toward town.
I drove aimlessly, hoping to find someone who would help me, but none of them would stop. Some people told me I should turn myself in, others told me I was lucky to be alive, but no one offered to help me. Finally, a police officer approached me while I was driving down Main Street. He leaned against his cruiser, blocking my path. ""Can I help you?"" I asked.
He smirked and pointed at my shirt. ""Is this your car?"" he asked.
""Yes, it is. Why do you ask?"" I asked.
He tapped his chin, thinking. ""Well, it doesn't belong to you. I just reported a stolen vehicle earlier today. Now, here you are, driving it.""
""That makes sense,"" I said, nodding. ""Thank you for telling me.""
He nodded back and walked back to his patrol car. I continued down the street, passing cars that sped past me. A few of the drivers gave me dirty looks, but most ignored me completely. I stopped at a light and waited impatiently, tapping my foot. The light turned green and I sped forward, weaving in between traffic. I passed another police cruiser and waved, trying to catch its attention. Nothing happened.
I drove around the block and pulled into a parking lot, pulling my phone out of my pocket. I dialed a number that I hadn't used since I was little, but the person answered anyway.
""Hello?"" Daddy asked.
""Daddy, please come get me,"" I pleaded.
""Where are you, sweetheart?""
""I'm at home,"" I lied.
""Okay, I'll be there shortly. Just wait for me, okay?"" he asked.
""I'm sorry, Daddy. I love you.""
""I love you too, baby. Hang tight. I'm on my way.""
When I hung up the phone, I started crying. I was so scared, but I knew I wasn't alone. Daddy was on his way and would make sure I was safe.
As soon as I saw the headlights of my father's car, I began to cry again. I wiped the tears from my eyes and stepped out of the car. Daddy opened the passenger door and held out his hand. When I grabbed hold of it, I noticed the ring on his finger.",1106,-0.6025873537863305,-0.8506762234190691,0.7219672301795096,0.1856115644441713,0.378934932985651
199,R_b7QdL0JrJcgGipH,OUR_HR_1,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. A light summer rain had begun to fall and she hadn't even bothered with an umbrella. The young woman wore a simple dress, black as the night, which fell about her legs in loose folds that did nothing to conceal their length and shape. She had short-cropped dark hair that hung in thick, ragged curls all around her head and her face was round and pretty. He didn't know her name or what she looked like under the veil, but he could tell from the way her eyes locked onto him that she was staring directly through his soul.
He wanted her badly, but he knew better than to attempt anything, not after his experience with her sister. So he busied himself by pouring drinks and setting out fresh cups of beer for the few customers who were left. And when she finally went outside, he pretended not to notice.
But he couldn't stop thinking about her. She was so beautiful and seemed so alone. He wondered if there had been some tragedy that drove her to the tavern that night. If he'd seen more clearly, he would have realized that the tragedy she was seeking wasn't found at the end of the road, but rather inside her heart.
That night in his dreams she came to him again, but instead of wearing the veil, she wore a long white wedding dress and stood beneath a full moon in a clearing surrounded by wildflowers. His heart stopped beating as he watched her walk toward him and knew at that moment that she was the woman he was meant to love. When he finally got his courage up to go talk to her, she was gone.
But her beauty remained burned into his memory.
So when he saw her at the inn a week later, he didn't hesitate. He knew now that she had come back to him from those dreams. He called for a song to be sung and when it was finished, he went over to the table and sat beside her. She smelled of lily-of-the-valley and his fingers tingled where they touched her arm.
""Are you alone?"" he asked.
She nodded and he knew at that moment that she was meant for him. ""You've come back to me,"" he said, hoping his voice wouldn't break.
She smiled softly and the stars danced around her like a shower of shooting stars. ""It's the only place I ever wanted to be.""
He thought she was being coy, but then realized that she must have seen how much he liked her as well. She had chosen to sit next to him, instead of across from him, which would have made it seem like a bold move on his part. It was so obvious. Why hadn't he seen it before?
They spent the entire day together, laughing and talking until the tavern closed for the night. She said nothing about the veil, and he didn't ask. He thought about her all night long, and when she wasn't in his thoughts, he was dreaming about her. They slept together that night, and when the sun rose, they were still wrapped up in each other's arms.
""Will you marry me?"" he asked when the day began to wane and their bodies were completely sated.
She laughed lightly and pulled away from him. ""We're already married,"" she replied. ""This is just a dream, after all.""
He looked at her in amazement, then laughed himself. ""Yes, but if this is a dream, then why don't we get some breakfast before it ends?"" He reached down and took her hand and they walked together through the woods.
The morning came too soon, and when it did, she went back to the place where she'd been born and disappeared without a trace. The tavern owner, who had given them an entire room to stay in for free, told him she must have had a family somewhere else and that he didn't understand how he could have forgotten. She'd always been a bit strange, he said, and he wasn't even sure what her name had been, but he was sorry for him anyway.
His love for her never ended though, and he continued to spend all of his days searching for her in the hopes that one day she might return. But she never did.
So he came back here and waited for her to come back to him. He didn't want to say goodbye. There were so many things he wanted to do with her, to tell her. To make her laugh again like he had seen her doing the night before. He wasn't going to let her go without fighting for her, so he decided to find the man who'd taken her and see if he had any idea where she was.
He hadn't found the man yet, but he knew exactly what he would do if he did.
It was time to tell her everything that had happened, to finally reveal his love to her.
She'd come back to him from those dreams. He could feel it in his bones.
The room began to spin as he walked down the aisle toward the man who had caused his wife's disappearance. He felt like someone was trying to pull his heart out of his chest as he closed in on him, then struck him so hard that the world seemed to turn inside out. When he regained his senses, he saw the man lying in the dirt, writhing in pain and looking up at him with hatred burning behind his eyes.
Then the room faded away and he woke up in a cold sweat.
The man was still lying there, just as he'd been when he first laid eyes on him. He didn't know how long he'd been sleeping, but he figured he must have fallen asleep while sitting down because he couldn't remember ever standing up. So he stood up and looked around, but no one was there. Just the man.
He tried to run over and beat the shit out of him, but for some reason, his body wouldn't respond. All he could do was watch in horror as the man rose to his feet and took another step forward.
""What the hell?"" he thought to himself. ""Am I dreaming or something? But if I'm not dreaming, then what is this?""
He watched as the man raised his hands into the air and began to speak words that sounded like gibberish. They made no sense whatsoever.
Then the man pointed directly at him and spoke the same nonsensical words that were coming from his mouth. The man began to smile and the walls of his mind started to crumble. Then everything went black and he felt himself falling off the edge.
The moment before he fell away, he remembered that he was dreaming again.
He woke up with a start, but couldn't move at first. His muscles felt so weak, it was like they'd been paralyzed. He could see the woman lying beside him, her face filled with worry and love and he could tell she had no idea what was happening. She tried to wake him up, but when she touched his arm, he screamed like someone had poured boiling acid down his throat.
Then it passed, and he was able to move again, but the room was completely dark.",1272,-1.5670147372698002,-0.702977516231325,-0.2150534808620048,-0.46961117368979755,-0.42044212752447413
200,R_3F5rXZ0v8Vq9Lkk,LOW_HF_6,High Fantasy,Low Rider,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Abandoned,"" said Rufus. ""We can't have that."" He took his staff off his shoulder and placed it behind him as if he were about to give a sermon before taking a step forward, sweeping it around in an arc in front of him, and bringing it down on the ground with a resounding thud. A cloud of dust rose up from the spot where it landed and settled again. ""There,"" he said once the noise had stopped. ""Now we know where to start looking for clues.""
As expected, nothing else happened; there was no one in the village nor any sign that anyone had been recently.
They headed down the path towards the village until they reached a clearing between two of the towers. The first tower was easily twenty feet tall while the second was half that. It stood on stilts that jutted out from the top of the tower so that only the very tops of its windows were visible at eye level. At the base, several thick ropes connected the structure to the ground so that whoever owned the thing could move it around when necessary. A small door led straight inside while a staircase climbed to the right, leading up to the open balcony. There was an iron-bound chest set just below it. Rufus approached it and pulled it out so that the others could see what was contained within. They all stepped back and Rufus opened the lid and peered inside.
He closed the lid again and walked slowly to the nearest tree, where he picked up a fallen branch, and began to walk around the edge of the village, examining each house from one side to another.
""You've done this before, haven't you?"" said Alassa.
Rufus nodded, his mouth twisted into an expression of grim disapproval as he moved around to the other side of the village where they had left the carriage.
Alassa sighed. ""What's wrong with this picture? We're here to find someone who has gone missing and instead of asking questions we're going to go searching for them.""
""If she hasn't gone missing yet, then there might not be much we can do to help her,"" said Rufus.
""I don't think she's disappeared at all,"" said Alassa. ""At least I hope that's not the case. Otherwise it won't matter how good our search is. We'll never find her in time."" She paused and considered something. ""But perhaps I'm being too pessimistic. Maybe she really did disappear after all.""
""How would you know that?"" asked Rufus.
""The villagers are all still there. They haven't been replaced by any other people, or ghosts, or whatever they turn out to be.""
Rufus turned back to face Alassa. ""So, if they haven't vanished, where is she?""
Alassa shook her head. ""No idea. We'll have to search every building in the village and see if anything catches our eye.""
Rufus frowned thoughtfully for a moment, then he nodded. ""Okay. Let's get started.""
They walked slowly along the path to the village square which was empty except for a few old barrels scattered about and a couple of wooden benches. Rufus glanced up at the tower closest to them but there was nothing to indicate it was occupied.
Alassa pointed at the tower with the rope connecting it to the ground. ""What exactly happens when you use the staff on things like this?""
""It creates a temporary shield around whatever or whoever it hits,"" said Rufus. ""It's designed to stop anything from getting inside and causing trouble – it stops people from coming into range of my power if they try to attack me from behind or sneak up on me from the side without warning. It's not meant to protect me from physical attacks – if I'm attacked, I will take damage just like anybody else would.""
""I see.""
""And it doesn't last long,"" warned Rufus. ""Only for a few seconds; it wears off quickly.""
They continued on towards the next tower, where the stairs leading up to the balcony were more ornate than those on the first one and they climbed upwards. On the way up, they passed several small rooms, some empty, most containing objects they didn't recognise.
They reached the balcony and Rufus put his hands on his hips, turning to face the group. ""Well?""
They looked around themselves as if expecting to see something they hadn't noticed before but there was nothing unusual to be seen. ""I guess the question now becomes,"" said Alassa, ""where does she live? Where is she hiding? That's the first question.""
""Yes,"" said Rufus, ""but where do we even begin looking for the answer to that question? I don't know what she looks like.""
""I doubt she lives in one of the houses,"" said Alassa. ""That would make things difficult. She must have her own hideaway, somewhere she can rest without being found, away from prying eyes.""
Rufus shrugged. ""Okay. I suppose we'll just have to start exploring the village and see what we find.""
Alassa nodded and began walking around the edges of the village square, moving from one end to the other, examining everything as they went. Rufus followed her example, inspecting all the buildings and trying to imagine how it would feel if someone he cared about were suddenly gone. He couldn't. It wasn't possible. How could he have missed noticing that she'd gone? What would life be like without her?
He stopped and leaned against a post, resting his arms on the top of it and gazing up at the tower above them. ""What if she really has disappeared?""
""Then we find out where she's gone and come looking for her,"" said Alassa. ""She wouldn't just leave us hanging, would she? She wouldn't just vanish without saying anything.""
""Maybe not,"" said Rufus. ""But you also can't know that for sure.""
""Why not?""
""Because she's probably lying low until she's ready to make her move."" Rufus sighed. ""We're wasting our time here.""
""No we aren't,"" said Alassa. ""Look. Here comes the sun.""
Rufus turned to look where Alassa was pointing and saw that the sky was beginning to darken. ""What?"" he said, looking back at her.
""It's sunset already? How is that possible?""
""The days in this world are shorter than ours,"" explained Alassa. ""We'll have to work faster.""
""I still say we should wait until morning,"" said Rufus.
""If we wait until morning, then she could be miles away before we find her.""",1154,-0.22830727383289687,0.2486573688703645,-0.6743206029675674,-0.21619255972622442,0.23055367939862367

A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Where are we?"" Elisabeth asked as they rode towards the settlement.
""We're about halfway between Solanis and Varni,"" Erland replied. ""It's a common stop for merchants travelling between those two cities.""
""Is it safe?""
""I'm sure it is,"" he assured her, keeping his voice calm. His hand had remained around the hilt of his sword ever since leaving the castle and he hadn't let go of it until now.
Elisabeth's eyes narrowed suspiciously at him. ""Are you going to let me finish my question?""
He sighed heavily, though whether he did so in exasperation or just the effort of holding on to his anger was unclear. ""I promise I won't do anything reckless without letting you know first."" He lowered his hand. ""As much as it pains me to admit it, we'll need your help if we want to get inside that tower.""
""And why would I want to help you?"" she asked, the annoyance clear in her tone.
He smiled reassuringly at her and patted the horse's neck. ""Because I can see in the dark.""
""What?""
""Look at my face,"" he said softly. ""Can you see anything there?""
She frowned. ""You look fine.""
He grinned widely at her, then pulled out his lantern and waved it back and forth over his face.
""Oh!"" she cried as the light flashed over him. ""Why didn't you say so earlier?""
""That's because I'm not a complete moron.""
She rolled her eyes but laughed anyway. ""All right. So, what is this place?""
""It's called Portol. It used to be a bustling settlement with several towers around the lake, but they're all deserted now. Some say the land was cursed or that the lord of the area was an evil sorcerer who turned his own people against one another. Most likely, it was just an isolated spot along the trade routes where nobody wanted to live.
""Whatever the reason, the lord abandoned the town a long time ago, leaving the towers as ruins. He built a new manor house in the forest on the other side of the river, but most of the inhabitants have moved to Varni in search of better opportunities.""
""But why would anyone want to move here? What's left to do? Fish the lake or chop down trees?"" Elisabeth asked skeptically.
Erland chuckled. ""Nothing you would be interested in, I imagine. They probably just need more hands for the new farm they're establishing near the lake. That's why they're hiring.""
Elisabeth's eyebrows shot up as she looked at him curiously. ""A farm? Do they plan to start a farm?""
He shook his head. ""No, that was just me reading into the conversation we overheard. The old lord said he was hiring more guards.""
She snorted. ""Why would they do that?""
""Because I don't think the last ones lived very long after he told them about it."" Erland gestured towards the tower to their right with his thumb. ""They were all dead by morning.""
Elisabeth shivered. ""Do you think they came to kill the new guards too?""
He nodded. ""Probably.""
""And there are so many of them that they can afford to hire more?"" she asked, looking around the village suspiciously. ""How much money does this place even produce? There aren't any shops, no stalls. Are they growing anything on those hills over there?""
""I don't know,"" he replied as he kicked his horse forward, keeping it well out of range of the others. ""But I can tell you what they're not doing…and that's fishing. The river Tethys runs all the way to the lake, and the only way to get water is to draw from it."" He pulled the reins and guided the horse over to the tower where the two sentinels stood guard, then dismounted and tied the horse to the hitching post outside the entrance. He reached into a saddlebag he had strapped to the horse's back and pulled out the key, unlocking the door. ""Come on, I'll show you around.""
He held the lantern aloft as he led her through the dark interior of the tower, leading her to the staircase that descended down into the basement. They made their way carefully, in case anyone was hiding inside. The staircase ended at a small hallway with four doors along one side. Two of the doors were closed; one was slightly ajar; and the fourth, directly across from them, was open.
Erland opened the door and stepped inside, Elisabeth following close behind him. The room was bare except for an iron safe, several boxes of candles, and some sacks full of food. In the corner sat a large wooden table with three chairs around it. The floor beneath them had been swept clean of debris, but not cleaned very thoroughly. A single chair had been placed before the table, facing away from the door. The only other piece of furniture in the room was the lone bed positioned against one wall. It was empty and showed no sign that anyone had slept there recently.
""Now, we know that the first group of guards that died weren't attacked by this place itself,"" Erland said softly. ""I'm pretty certain that they were poisoned by whoever was trying to kill us.""
""How do you know?"" Elisabeth asked.
He frowned. ""Because I just did.""
She glanced at him curiously. ""You mean…you think someone is here now?""
Erland nodded. ""Yes.""
Elisabeth swallowed hard. ""I don't suppose you have any idea who it could be? Maybe I could talk to them first. You know, see what they're like, what their goals are.""
Erland shook his head. ""I already tried. Whoever is inside there doesn't want to talk. Not to me at least.""
""How can you tell?"" she asked. ""It's so dark in here; I can't even see your face.""
He pulled down the lantern and pointed towards a small section of the ceiling directly over the table. ""The light's not reflecting off the glass on the lantern. That means whoever is in there is using a different source of light. And you can tell who's talking based on the way their words bounce off the walls, right?""
Elisabeth nodded. ""So?""
He chuckled. ""It means that someone is whispering.""
Her eyes widened slightly. ""They're still alive, then?""
""I'd bet my life on it,"" he replied. ""Though, I'm not sure if I should be pleased or afraid. The last time we went up against an enemy that used magic, you were pretty useless. I hope this is going to be easier for you to deal with.""",1164,0.6581688828450358,0.9757987250244514,-0.040283624485322085,-0.18491492240359977,0.4950124449596558
202,R_2OJWXxkDCQbdeng,MOR_HOR_1,Horror,Morpho,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a woman's face but it wasn't mine. The face had a long, thin nose, red lips and dark eyes. She looked familiar but I couldn't place her. I looked back into the mirror and saw a white hand on the side of the glass, holding on to the frame.
""What do you want?"" I asked.
""I want to be loved,"" it said.
""Who are you?"" I asked, and then I realized I heard that voice before. It was my voice.
""My name is Sarah, Sarah Taylor,"" she said.
""Sarah? Is that your real name?"" I asked her.
""Yes.""
""Why are you here? What do you want?""
Sarah was silent for a minute.
""I'm here for you,"" she finally said.
""What do you mean?"" I asked.
""I'm here for you,"" she repeated.
""How did you get in here?"" I asked.
""I broke in,"" she said with a laugh.
""What do you mean?""
""I'm here for you,"" she said again as she pulled her hand away from the mirror and disappeared.
And just as she disappeared, so did the mirror. I was left in the dark room with nothing but my thoughts. I thought about what Sarah said and realized that she was right. I did need someone to love me. Maybe she was right after all. The way she said it sounded like she was trying to be honest with me. Maybe I could take a chance with her. It might be worth it if I did love her back.
I opened the door and walked out of the bedroom and down the stairs to see who else was in the house. As I turned the corner to the kitchen, my mom came running out of the closet with a knife in her hand and a look on her face that made me drop to my knees right away.
""Mom? What's going on?"" I asked her as my hands went to my stomach and I looked down at myself to see blood dripping from my hand onto the floor.
""Get the hell out of here!"" she said as she stepped toward me with her knife still pointed at me. ""Get out now!""
I backed away from her as quickly as I could and ran into the living room where Sarah stood by the front door with her hands up in the air.
""I don't want to hurt you,"" she said as she looked at me through the glass of the front door. ""I just want to let you know that everything is going to be okay.""
I looked over at my mom who stood by the kitchen door with her hands still on the handle and a look on her face that made me want to scream for help right away. A part of me wanted to scream, but another part of me wanted to know what she wanted first before I did anything else.
""Why are you doing this?"" I asked her as I walked toward her slowly and watched as my mom stepped back a little bit from me and gripped the handle even tighter with one hand while holding the knife in the other hand tighter than ever before. ""Why are you doing this?""
""I have to protect myself,"" she said as she looked into my eyes with a piercing stare through the glass of the door. ""It's not your fault, but if you stay here, you're going to die.""
""What do you mean?"" I asked, but then she opened the door and stepped aside so that Sarah could grab my arm and pull me outside with her as she ran down the front steps of our house and onto our front lawn where we both stopped and stared at each other for a moment in silence as my mom stood behind us with her eyes wide open and a look of horror on her face as if we were all caught up in some kind of nightmare that we couldn't wake up from.
Sarah took a deep breath in and exhaled slowly as she looked at me through the glass of the door and then at my mom who stood behind us with her hands still on the handle as if she was frozen in time while we all waited for something horrible to happen that we never expected to happen at all. Her eyes turned into deep blue pools of water as they stared at me while we waited for something terrible to happen that we never thought would happen at all.
""I'm sorry,"" Sarah said as she looked into my eyes, ""but it's going to be okay."" And then just like that, Sarah turned around and started running down our street as fast as she could until I couldn't see her anymore. And then just like that, my life changed forever before it all ended before it even started.

203,R_2eXQvXmB3whjmeT,MOR_HOR_5,Horror,Morpho,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. I screamed and fell to the floor. The face laughed at me.
I slowly got up and reached for the light switch. When I turned it on, the face was gone. I got back in bed and started to cry.
I'm scared. This is my last night here. Just a few hours until Dad gets here, and then we're going to my Grandma's house. I don't want to be here anymore.
I got out of bed again and went into the bathroom. I took off my clothes and got in the shower. I turned on the water and let it run over me as I cried.
I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to live here anymore. I just want to go home, home, home.
I stayed in the shower until there wasn't any hot water left. I turned off the water and wrapped a towel around myself as I dried off.
When I was done, I opened my closet and found my clothes. I picked out a baggy t-shirt and a pair of long shorts. They're so big on me, but at least they're clean.
I walked down the stairs and into the kitchen. The house didn't look empty; it was full of people sitting around drinking coffee and talking.
""Good morning,"" Mrs. Adams said as she passed me.
""Good morning,"" I said back to her as she went to her bedroom.
My mother was standing by the stove, cooking breakfast.
""Oh, good morning Katie,"" she said as she turned around. ""How do you like your eggs?""
""Over easy, please.""
""Coming right up.""
I sat down at the table and watched her make my breakfast as she talked to all of us at the table. She seemed happy, but I couldn't tell if that was just because it was Sunday or if she was actually happy to have us over for another week.
My father came in a few minutes later with his coat on and his briefcase in hand. He stopped in his tracks when he saw me sitting there. For a moment, he didn't say anything at all, but then he finally asked me how I was doing.
""I'm fine.""
He didn't say anything else to me until our breakfast was ready, at which point he started eating it as fast as he could while he talked to everyone else at the table.
When we were finished with breakfast, we got our coats on and went outside to the car. Mrs. Adams was standing there with a large bag in her arms, and she gave my father a hug when he got out of the car.
""I'm glad you came,"" she said to him while they hugged. ""You're always welcome here.""
""Thank you Mrs. Adams,"" he said to her as they pulled apart from each other. ""We'll be back next week.""
""Goodbye Katie,"" she said as she kissed me on the forehead and gave me another hug before my father could get out of the car.
""Bye Mrs. Adams,"" I said to her while I held onto her tightly for a few seconds before she went inside.
Then we were on our way again. The drive wasn't too bad this time; we were both tired from all of the excitement of moving and not having any sleep last night, so we both fell asleep during the drive up until we got here... or so we thought.
When we got into town, Dad pulled over at a gas station so that he could get some coffee before we got home, and I woke up when he opened my door for me from inside the car. When I got out of the car, something felt wrong, so I walked around to the other side of the car to see what was wrong with it. There was nothing wrong with it except for all of the blood that was caked on the metal bumper and hood where my head had been resting last night when he put me in the car. I screamed and ran back towards him so that I could get back into the car and out of there before anyone else in town saw me... or him... covered in blood...
When I got back into the car, Dad had already paid for our coffee and cigarettes... again... and we were on our way home once again without me even having a chance to talk to him about what had happened last night before he put me down for a nap again... or so we thought...
We finally made it home after stopping by Grandma's house for a little bit, and Mom didn't seem very excited about anything... until she opened up her jewelry box while we were in her bedroom putting things away from our bags where she kept everything in her room that she didn't want us to see... including her collection of dead husbands that she had stuffed in there before we came into town for Easter dinner this afternoon... or so we thought...
I woke up from my nap from hell about an hour before dinner was supposed to be served; I still wasn't sure if dinner was going to be served at all with how quiet everything had been around here since we'd gotten home from Grandma's house this afternoon... or so we thought... until Mom walked through the front door with a large bouquet of flowers... or what was left of them anyway... after what had happened this afternoon... or so we thought... until Dad came in about ten minutes later with Mom right beside him with their jackets on... or what was left of them after what had happened this afternoon... or so we thought... but when they walked into the dining room, they didn't seem like they were going to have anything to do with any dinner at all after what had happened this afternoon before we came home this evening... or so we thought... until Mom started talking about how she should have gotten more flowers earlier this afternoon... or so we thought... until Dad told us that he wanted to go outside for a little bit so that he could think about things before he decided whether or not he wanted dinner tonight after all after what had happened this afternoon... or so we thought... but then one of them came upstairs with us and put us back down for another nap this afternoon... or so we thought... but when Dad came upstairs about half an hour ago with his coat on and his briefcase in hand, they both seemed like they were going to have something to do with dinner after all after what had happened this afternoon when they put us both down for another nap this afternoon before dinner... or so we thought... but when we woke up an hour later from our nap from hell just before dinner was supposed to be served, they still didn't seem like they wanted anything to do with dinner after what had happened this afternoon before we came home this evening after what had happened this afternoon when they put us both down for another nap this afternoon before dinner... or so we thought... but then Mom walked through the front door with a large bouquet of flowers that were half dead before she put them on one of the dining room tables after what had happened this afternoon after she put us both down for another nap this afternoon before dinner... or so we thought...",1310,-0.7528968831410736,0.11770123305623616,-0.5844724187335893,-1.0938881361333808,0.19690627503034852
204,R_6rjL9IlRv4dTvO1,OUR_HSF_2,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
My head pounded as if I'd been drinking all night; my eyes were sore and bloodshot.
I looked at the envelope in my hand and opened it to find a note, written on a simple piece of paper and sealed with red wax. I picked up the phone on my desk and dialed the number Dr. Sato had given me. The call went through quickly, and soon a voice answered: the president himself.
""Hello?"" He sounded like he'd just woken up. ""Hello? Is anyone there? Hello?""
I held the receiver away from my ear as if I was going to throw it against something.
""Hi,"" I said slowly. ""It's me.""
He made no reply but didn't hang up either. After a few moments the line clicked off.
I sat on the edge of my bed and put my hands to my temples, massaging them lightly. The president had called me here with this cryptic message; obviously he wanted something.
A thought struck me, and I got up from my bed to get my car keys and wallet from my pocket. As I did so, I realized that I still had no idea what I should be doing. I mean, I could hardly ask Dr. Sato to do my job for me! If she found out what I'd done, I'd never hear the end of it, and who knew what would happen to me.
I took a deep breath and went out my door. I paused before stepping outside into the sunlight. What had the president meant when he said ""this afternoon""? It wasn't even midday yet, let alone an evening or night. I went to the parking garage down the street from my apartment and put my car keys and wallet in the glove box.
Then I drove off, heading down the main boulevard of the city. It was the same route I used to take when I'd come back from my trips to Earth. My stomach clenched at the sight of it; I knew that if I didn't get this right, then the only thing that was going to happen was I was going to die.
I parked near the center of town and walked through the shopping district until I came to the hotel where I had my last meeting with the president. I made sure that nobody was around before opening the front door of the building; I couldn't risk being seen here. There were a few people outside, chatting, but they paid little attention to me.
I entered the lobby and saw two men behind a small counter. They glanced up at me as I walked in, and then went back to their business.
""Hello?"" one of them asked after a moment. I hadn't spoken to anybody here in over a year, so it took him a moment to recognize who I was.
""Hi,"" I said, feeling nervous about having to do this. ""I need to speak with the president.""
He turned to look at me again.
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said after a few seconds. ""But the president is not in his office at the moment. Do you have an appointment?""
""I don't need one,"" I said quickly. ""He asked me to come and meet him.""
The man looked confused for a moment.
""Oh… I see."" He started typing on a computer. ""Sir, I will go and make an announcement that you are here, and ask the president if he can spare some time to speak with you. If he does, he'll be out in a moment.""
He looked up at me expectantly. I stood there silently as he typed something else into the computer. Then, as I waited, he brought his gaze back up to me.
""What's your name?""
""Hiroto Kana,"" I said.
""Okay,"" he said. ""Thank you."" He turned his attention back to the computer and typed quickly. After a few moments he looked back up to me.
""Mr. Kana has just arrived to see you. Please wait a moment.""
He turned and walked off, heading towards a doorway behind him.
I nodded to myself and took a seat on one of the couches. The president had never done this before—not that he would have ever asked me to do anything like this when we were both on Earth. I sat there nervously, looking around at the people in the lobby, and then glanced over at the counter where the man had been standing. His computer was now off.
A few minutes passed before the door opened and a man in his mid-thirties came out, walking casually towards me.
He had short black hair, which he brushed backwards from his forehead with one hand; he wore a blue suit that looked slightly wrinkled, as though he'd only recently put it on.
He smiled at me as he walked down the steps.
""Mr. Kana,"" he said. ""It's good to see you again.""
He reached out a hand, and I took it and shook it firmly.
""And you,"" I said. ""It's nice to meet you in person.""
The president nodded, a wry smile playing across his face for a moment. ""Come,"" he said. ""Let's not stand around in here.""
We walked together into an elevator, then headed up to the third floor, where the president's office was. He didn't say anything on the way up, and I remained silent too, unsure what to say.
As soon as we entered the room, he turned to face me.
""Do you have it?"" he asked.
""Yes, sir,"" I replied. ""It's ready for you to take back to Earth.""
""Good,"" he said. ""That's one problem solved. Now we just have to wait and see what the rest of the situation will be.""
He leaned forward in his chair.
""Before I show it to you,"" he continued, ""there's something I need to explain to you. I know this sounds crazy, but… well, you'll see. It's hard to explain, so let me start at the beginning.""
He looked up to me and paused.
I hesitated, too, trying to find the right words. I'd already heard something about this, so it seemed strange that the president would choose this moment to tell me all this, but it was his decision, and I had no way to argue with him.
""If it were possible,"" he began, ""if there was some way to bring life-forms from Earth to Mars, and if it were possible to make it look like they'd been living here for years—perhaps even millions of years—wouldn't we want to do that?""
""Why?"" I asked.
""To start with,"" he said, ""because we could put them to work. We could use their expertise. We could hire them and pay them well. They could help us out on a whole host of different levels. In fact, they'd be able to teach us many things we don't have the knowledge to understand yet.""",1210,0.9020479232029996,0.3054126125394178,-1.249247676859824,0.490676859707299,1.2691353384385287

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
A few minutes later, I made my way down the hill toward the city center where I parked my car. My apartment was located in one of the older parts of town; even though there were newer buildings right across the street, most of them had been built during the last century. The area was quiet, but not so much so that I wouldn't hear if someone approached me from behind. When I parked my car, I saw a man wearing an old-style suit holding up a sign which read, ""Do you need a ride anywhere?"" He was standing next to a beat-up, blue pickup truck. I looked around, seeing no other cars or pedestrians nearby and nodded my head.
The man opened the passenger door as I walked around to the back of the truck. Inside were two benches with yellowed cushions along both sides—the kind you would find outside the front seat of a bus. The driver sat in the middle, while the passenger side held a single brown leather chair which folded down when he wasn't using it. Once I was inside, he closed the door and started the engine. We drove away from the city center, passing through an area where the houses were all low-slung and made of brick. After about ten minutes, we pulled onto a dirt road and headed deeper into the mountains.
""Where are we going?"" I asked after sitting there quietly for a moment.
""Just around the bend,"" answered the man. ""You're welcome to sit up front if you want.""
I hesitated, then sighed. ""No, that's okay. You can just drop me off here."" I pointed to a small copse of trees near the edge of the road. ""It's up there somewhere.""
""Okay,"" replied the man. ""If you change your mind, give me a call."" He drove off without saying anything else.
I climbed out of the vehicle and walked through the forest toward a large boulder. It had obviously been moved by some geological process, leaving the base unevenly shaped. There was a clear space beneath it, however, giving me a perfect view of the valley below. As I sat there, I could see a few people who were walking on the flat ground. A few of them were wearing red, military uniforms and others wore jeans and t-shirts. The only thing that seemed out of place was the white van they were driving. They were traveling in a convoy of five vehicles with men wearing black suits and sunglasses riding inside each one. One of them stopped and got out of the lead vehicle before running to the rear of the group. Another one followed him, and then another, until every member of the group was moving in unison toward the same spot. I watched them for a few seconds, trying to make sense of what I was seeing, but couldn't figure out why they were all converging on the same area. Then a loud boom echoed from above, making me look up toward the sky. From far away, I could make out the sound of a helicopter landing. I stood up to see if I could get a better view, but something caught my eye from where I was standing. The ground was shaking, and it didn't take long for me to realize that an earthquake had happened. By the time I ran back to the truck, I had lost sight of the group of people. I looked around, searching for any signs of life, but found nothing.
""What the hell?"" I muttered. I looked at my watch and realized it was still early enough to be lunchtime. So, I decided to go back to my apartment and eat. But first, I wanted to check the news to see if I could find out what had happened.
When I turned on the television, I saw the newscaster talking about a small quake that had occurred earlier that morning. She said that some scientists believed that the tremors were caused by a shift in the planet's crust, but most people in the country thought it was just another natural disaster. I turned off the TV and went to the kitchen to make myself a sandwich. Then I ate it quickly so that I could go and visit the president to tell him what I'd seen.
After I finished eating, I stepped outside to grab my car keys from the table by the front door. Before I left, I noticed a piece of paper lying on the floor next to one of the chairs. I picked it up, looking at it curiously, but couldn't make out what it said because the writing was so small. I unfolded it and saw that there was a note written in English. I tried to decipher it, but found myself unable to do so. Instead, I carried it to the couch and sat down to try and read it again. After a minute, I gave up and put it back on the floor where it had originally been. I went to my car and drove to the government building where the president lived. As soon as I arrived, I went straight to his office, knocking on the door and waiting for someone to let me in. When no one did, I pushed the door open and entered. The room was empty except for a few chairs, a desk, and a computer monitor mounted on the wall. I glanced around, wondering if anyone had heard me come in, but saw no one. I walked over to the desk and picked up a pair of glasses that were resting on top of it. They were thick and dark, with a glass frame that looked like it was made of gold. I picked them up and examined them closely. Then, I looked at the computer screen to see if it was connected. It appeared not to be.
I placed the glasses on my face and waited a few moments before looking up to check the clock on the wall. It was only half past twelve! I hadn't expected it to take this long. I picked up the phone and dialed the number for the president's personal assistant. After a few rings, she answered and told me that the president was in a meeting. I asked her to call him and tell him that I needed to speak with him immediately. She promised to do so and hung up. I smiled, realizing that I knew his assistant. Her name was Yuki. We had met several times before since she worked in his office, and I liked her. Unlike many of the people in the government, Yuki was incredibly friendly and easy to talk to.
""Yuki, you remember me, don't you?"" I asked.
""Yes, I know you, Mr. Fukai,"" she responded. ""How may I help you today?""
""Well, I've got a message for you from the president,"" I began. ""He wants us to meet with him at his office.""
""Oh, hello there!"" came a voice from the hallway. ""Are you Mr. Fukai? The secretary mentioned that you were coming.""
I looked up and saw Yuki walking toward me. She was smiling as usual, but something about her expression didn't seem quite right to me. I wondered if maybe she had been crying lately.
""Hi, Yuki,"" I replied. ""I'm sorry for disturbing you this late. Is the president available now?""
""Yes, he is,"" she answered. ""But please wait a moment.",1312,-0.6696710155826431,-0.6011759462374127,-1.1745779604757751,-0.3145272528407634,-1.4873017350994857
206,R_2VyAOrJNr8Bgtyc,OUR_HR_6,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. She wasn't anything special to look at—not beautiful or ugly, but young and very, very naïve. He'd watched as she ordered food, then paid for it with a gold piece that had probably cost more than what he made in three days of hard work. The thought irritated him and he'd nearly blown his cover, just so he could have a chance to teach her a lesson about money.
But there was something in the way she moved that was different from all the other girls who frequented the inn—and most of those men. This one, at least, moved differently, almost like she knew what she was doing when she walked. It took him a long while to recognize it—it wasn't something he'd ever seen before; certainly nothing like the swaying movements of a dancer. He realized, then, that she was different on top of being naive. She'd never known anything but innocence in life and didn't understand that the world was harsh and cruel. And he wondered if she'd ever even felt pleasure.
When her food came, he watched her eat it. Not just that she ate it, which was normal for most people—but how she ate it. He could see in her eyes, just for a moment, that she was afraid to touch her food. She glanced at him, looking for help, and he saw that she had no idea what to do. He should have told her, then, that he would take care of her order for her, but instead, he had his own meal.
After he'd eaten and taken a seat at a nearby table, she wandered out onto the street, where he found her and took her back into the tavern.
He asked her questions about herself. She gave him answers—usually the same ones over and over again—but after a time, they weren't the same.
He couldn't bring himself to tell her what to do or how to act, but she grew more confident with each day. Soon, she was ordering her own food and taking care of herself. When she got bored, she went out to walk around, to see what was there for her to see.
She met people. Her first experience with anyone who wasn't from her small village was a boy who was staying in the inn. She thought he might be nice to her, so she talked to him—and he tried to make her feel uncomfortable. But she ignored him and kept walking. Then she found another boy, who seemed to like her, and they walked together.
A couple of days later, she stopped talking to any other person. When he saw her look up at him as they strolled along the street, he knew something was wrong. He asked her, and she told him about her village.
He hadn't been thinking at all; he just took off in a direction that would bring them closer to her home. When they finally reached it, he realized he had no idea where to go from there. And worse, there was no one there at the moment. He knew better than to wait for hours outside the house of an unknown child—especially a young girl who'd obviously never been far from her parents. So they set out to find some place to stay for the night, since he'd paid the innkeeper for the room for two nights.
They didn't talk much during the entire journey, and that worried him. Finally, though, when they were in a town that seemed to be quite well-off and safe, he said, ""Why did you stop talking?""
""You're not a bad person,"" she told him.
He knew exactly what she was talking about, but he wasn't about to apologize for it.
""But you have rules about how people treat each other,"" she continued.
She wasn't making much sense, but then again, neither were his thoughts. She must've known that he'd never met anyone else like himself, someone who lived by rules rather than feeling and instinct.
He'd been raised with those rules—from the time he could understand them, in fact—and he never questioned any of them. He simply accepted them as truth.
That didn't mean he didn't have feelings, or that he didn't get angry sometimes. But he also had learned how to control that anger and use it when necessary. And he'd learned long ago how to keep himself under control at all times. He couldn't let her see that, however, so he just nodded.
""I guess you have rules too, don't you?"" she asked.
He smiled, wondering why she thought that. He didn't have any rules he was aware of, certainly not the way she meant it.
She saw the smile on his face, though, and that puzzled her even more. ""What are your rules?""
He hesitated, then said, ""If I think of something important enough to put in a rule, it's not a good thing. It means the world needs to change.""
She laughed, which surprised him. ""Do you think the world is perfect?""
He shrugged. ""It can be.""
""But it's not,"" she countered.
She was right. They'd left the town soon after that.
They traveled through many villages and towns, stopping every now and then for supplies or to take a break from the road. But she refused to talk to anyone but him and he couldn't stand that. She wouldn't listen to reason. If he wanted her to speak with someone else, he had to make her do it.
He tried everything, even hitting her once, but that didn't work either. So they set out again. When he suggested stopping for the night, she refused to go near any building; if the people of a village had anything to do with her, it meant that she would've been punished—or worse.
When she finally stopped at the inn where he was staying, the next morning, he asked her to leave. She followed him without hesitation, but only after he'd given her money for food and drink.
She never stayed long. At first, she seemed to enjoy their travels, but after a few weeks, she started complaining. The food was horrible in the cities, the people were loud and rude and there wasn't any place to run and play.
That's when he realized that she was just like his sisters—the ones who'd gone to live with his uncle. He'd seen them so often in those few months before he left for the army that he knew exactly how they behaved.
She, however, didn't have anyone to help her. She didn't know what to do and no one ever taught her. If she didn't have a child to raise, someone to care for, then she had nothing to keep her busy. That's why she became bored. But she never understood that the world could be different, and that the way things were now was the best thing she could ask for.

She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The sight of her had been enough to take his breath away, but it also gave him an unexpected rush of anger that made him want to hurt someone for hurting her. That same woman, who had once been so beautiful she seemed to have stepped out of the pages of a fairy tale, now looked old and worn. Her hair was thinning, and there were lines around her eyes that hadn't been there before. It didn't make sense—how could this be happening?
""I'll be right back,"" he said, pushing his chair away from the table to go see what was wrong with her. He never even got past the doorway when the innkeeper came running up behind him. ""What's going on?"" the man asked breathlessly.
""She looks sick.""
""That's because she is sick,"" the landlord said in exasperation. ""And you've done nothing but stare at her all night. She's not interested in you anymore, so leave her alone.""
He wasn't sure why, but he couldn't accept that answer. His mother had always told him how important it was to treat people with respect. Even if they weren't particularly nice or kind, it was still important to show them courtesy and kindness. So, he went back to the table and sat down again.
""May I help you?"" she asked. There was no hint of warmth left in her voice. In fact, it sounded as though she was trying to sound harsh.
""I'm sorry,"" he stammered. ""I thought you might need some help with something.""
Her eyes narrowed slightly. ""No, thank you. You should get some rest. It isn't polite to keep a stranger up all night.""
""But—""
""Go home!"" she snapped. Then she turned and walked away without looking back.
The next few hours passed in a blur until the sun finally rose, bringing with it the promise of another day. All he could remember after that was walking back toward town, carrying his heavy load of firewood under his arm. Everything else disappeared into darkness. When he woke up the following morning, he found himself lying in the middle of the forest. He was covered by leaves and branches, and he felt like someone had stolen his body while he slept.
It took him a moment to realize where he was. He'd been working for the local lord, cutting down trees to build a new castle. It was part of a larger effort to expand the area around his home. Now that he was here, however, he decided he needed to find a way to get home. If only he could remember exactly how he'd gotten here, perhaps he would know the quickest path to follow.
He trudged through the woods, searching for any sign of a trail, but he found none. Finally, he came across a stream, which he followed upstream. He was almost certain he'd crossed it before, but there was no telling whether he'd gone far enough. All he knew was that he wanted to get back to his village as quickly as possible.
He was just coming upon the place where the stream joined a larger river when he heard shouts echoing through the trees. He stopped and listened carefully. At first, he thought it might be his friends calling out to him, but then he recognized their voices. It sounded like they were arguing about something.
Then a familiar voice called out, ""What are you doing here?""
He started to run toward the sound of the voice, but it was too late—the bushes rustled, and two men dressed in black appeared in front of him. They wore long cloaks that hid everything except for their faces. One was tall and lean, and the other was shorter and stockier, but both had dark brown hair. As soon as they stepped closer, he recognized the third man. He was the innkeeper, and he was holding a small knife in one hand.
""Did you follow me?"" he demanded.
""You look suspicious, just wandering around in the forest,"" the taller man said. ""We thought we should check you out.""
""I'm not lost,"" he replied. ""I was heading for town.""
""Where's your horse?""
""I don't have a horse,"" he insisted. ""Why would I need a horse?""
The three men stared at each other silently. Suddenly, the short man pulled his knife out and stabbed it into the ground.
""Here's a better question,"" he said. ""Have you seen any horses nearby?""
The taller man shoved him aside and bent down. His fingers brushed against something, and he reached inside the hole. The smaller man grabbed him by the shoulder and jerked his head up.
""What did you do?""
""Nothing,"" he protested. ""Just touching whatever was in the ground.""
The tall man moved close to the other side of the hole and leaned over it. When he straightened up again, he was smiling. ""This isn't good,"" he muttered. ""He must have found a cave.""
""A what?"" the skinny man asked.
""It means there's treasure hidden underground,"" the tall man explained. ""I'm going to have to report this immediately.""
He started to turn away, but the smaller man seized his arm and shook his head. ""Don't bother. Nobody will believe us anyway. Besides, we're going to take it for ourselves. And who knows? Maybe there really is some treasure buried here.""
The tall man smiled and nodded. ""I can't wait to start digging,"" he said.
The short man stood back up, and the three of them headed deeper into the woods. They didn't say anything to each other while they searched, but he noticed that they kept glancing back at him several times. When they finally found what they were looking for, he realized why.
They were standing in front of a large opening in the ground. The largest man picked up a stone and threw it down into the pit. A moment later, he heard the sound of running water, and the rock shot back out of the hole.
""There's a tunnel leading down here,"" the tall man said.
""Excellent,"" the short man said. ""Now let's fill it up and cover it up. We don't want anyone else stumbling upon this.""
The taller man began scooping dirt out of the hole with his hands. It filled the pit quickly, and soon it was completely covered. By the time he finished, the sun had already started to sink below the horizon.
""That should hold for now,"" he said. ""We'd best head back to town before it gets dark.""
""All right,"" the short man agreed. ""Let's go.""
He looked over at the tall man, who was staring intently at the mouth of the tunnel. ""What are you waiting for?"" he asked.
The big man turned and grinned back at him. ""For you to say goodbye.""
Suddenly, there was a loud clanging noise. He jumped back in surprise, and the others started laughing.",1185,-0.004421080322546548,0.810464791557946,0.05956988125195471,-0.7634150183458673,0.6923866871407212
208,R_2yeB4R35twzkCvw,GEN_HOR_4,Horror,Genesis,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The face had no eyes or nose, just two large holes for its mouth and ears. It smiled at me. I screamed in fright as it vanished. I ran over to my parents' room and knocked on their door before running back here. I sat down on the edge of my bed with my knees pulled close to my chest. My heart was racing so fast that I felt like it would explode any second now.
I could only imagine what this thing wanted from me. How did it even get into our house? And why is it still here when my parents are awake? What am I going to do if they wake up and see it too? Maybe I should call the police or something. That's an option right? I picked up my phone off my nightstand and tried to dial nine-one-one but I couldn't seem to get my finger to move. I tried calling it three more times but each time the same thing happened. I looked at the screen of my phone, hoping to find something that would give me some answers but all I saw were numbers and letters.
""What's wrong?"" Sarah asked as she opened her bedroom door. ""Are you okay?""
""Yes,"" I replied, trying to sound calm. ""Just had a bad dream.""
""Me too,"" she said, walking over to my bed. She leaned against the headboard and placed her hand on my leg. ""It was pretty scary. But I'm glad you're feeling better. You know, that thing gave me the creeps.""
""Yeah,"" I replied.
She looked down at my phone and then back at me.
""Didn't you say your phone wasn't working?""
""It isn't,"" I lied.
""Maybe we can call someone else instead?""
I turned away from her and grabbed the phone. I looked at the screen again and realized my fingers weren't moving anymore either. I tried to shake them but nothing was happening. Then I remembered where I was, and how I'd gotten here. I looked around my room to make sure everything was okay. When I saw the bed not made up and the covers thrown across the floor, my stomach dropped.
""Sarah,"" I called out.
She didn't respond so I stood up and walked towards her. There was no response. I reached out and touched her shoulder. It felt cold. I quickly let go of her and backed away. Her eyes were open and staring at mine. I felt myself start to panic as I looked down at her. Something wasn't right.
""Sarah!"" I cried out again.
Her eyes rolled back into her head and she fell backwards onto the floor. I rushed over and saw her lying unconscious. I looked around frantically for anything that might help. I spotted a book on her desk. I took it and brought it over to her. I flipped through the pages and found what I needed.
""911,"" I whispered to myself.
I pressed the buttons on the side of the phone and held it up to my ear. When I heard a voice I started to scream. I hung up the phone and threw it against the wall. Tears began to fill my eyes. I turned around to look at Sarah. She was still unconscious.
The monster was gone but now I had another problem. What should I do with Sarah? Should I try to take her somewhere safe or leave her alone until morning? If I left her here, who knew what would happen to her. I didn't want to think about it. I decided to check her pulse to be sure she was alive. I lifted up her wrist and felt it, checking for a heartbeat. As soon as I touched her arm, Sarah opened her eyes. I gasped as I stood back up.
""Where did you come from?"" I asked.
""I don't know,"" she answered. ""But I promise you I won't hurt you. I came inside because I was afraid you might be in trouble.""
""You were?""
""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come in without asking.""
""No, that's not what I meant,"" I said, wiping away tears. ""How did you get in here?""
""I snuck in,"" she explained. ""I didn't want to wake you up by knocking. I thought I could find the source of the noise and fix it before anyone woke up.""
""That's really nice of you, Sarah. But I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.""
""Okay,"" she replied. ""As long as you're sure, that's good enough for me.""
After checking on Sarah, I got dressed and went downstairs. I ate breakfast while my parents watched TV. They seemed to forget about the incident last night. I finished my meal and went to my room. I decided to turn on my computer so I could finally check my email. When I logged in, I noticed a new message at the top of my inbox. I clicked on it and read it.

Hi! I saw your name online and figured I'd write you. I haven't seen you since we graduated. Are you doing alright? I hope so. You seemed pretty upset after graduation. I understand if you don't remember me. I was one of the quiet ones. We never really talked much. Anyway, I'm trying to reach out to everyone from our class. I thought maybe you could help me out. Do you happen to know where I could find ************? I've been searching for him for quite a while now.
If you do happen to know where he is, please tell him I'm looking for him.
I hope to hear from you very soon.
Sincerely,
Your Friend,

209,R_cG8A8hhqxGRQGpb,LOW_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,Low Rider,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature would be around eighty degrees Fahrenheit, with clear skies and not much wind. I could feel some humidity in the air, but I had long gotten used to dealing with it. My clothes were all made from thin synthetic materials that would dry quickly, so there wasn't any reason for me to bring along an umbrella or raincoat.
As I walked down the street toward downtown, I thought about what President Hachiro might want. The last time he summoned us together, it was to inform us that our mission on Mars was being extended for two years. That meant I'd be spending most of my life here until then.
I'm a doctor by trade, specializing in surgery and emergency medicine, but since coming to Mars I've been mostly working as a research assistant for Dr. Sato at the medical laboratory where she has set up shop. She and I are both members of the Mars One project team. We're trying to build up enough supplies and equipment here on Earth that people can stay alive for one year on the planet. But our goal is really just to get people through their first year, which will hopefully lead to establishing a permanent human colony on Mars. If they can survive that long, after that it should only be a matter of time before we can settle into a real routine of living in space. I still don't know how long I'll be able to remain here once my initial assignment ends, but even if I'm stuck on Mars, it looks like I'll be able to live pretty well.
The Martian colony has no money, so we aren't allowed to work for a salary; instead, we receive a monthly stipend that's based on the number of days we've spent here. As of today, I've been on Mars for six months, and according to my records I've earned five thousand and forty-four days' worth of money. So far, my earnings total more than seventy million yen. Not bad for a job that's considered part time, right? And I haven't actually done anything that impressive yet. There are no doctors here, so Dr. Sato has basically turned me into a lab technician who does research.
When I got to the main square of town, the city center known as the ""Plaza,"" I saw Dr. Hachiro sitting at a table on the sidewalk, surrounded by a group of people wearing white protective suits and helmets. He stood up to greet me as I approached, then shook my hand and led me to a nearby café. ""Dr. Hachiro, thanks for meeting with me. I was worried you'd already gone back home.""
""That's not why I asked you to come,"" he replied, taking his seat across the table from me.
I smiled nervously. ""Then, um . . . what did you want to see me about?""
There were several large monitors mounted on the walls behind him, showing a variety of images from all over Mars—satellite views and pictures of the surface taken by rovers. A few of them showed the area where I lived, so I assumed these were photos taken by satellites orbiting the planet.
One man was standing off to the side next to Dr. Hachiro; I hadn't seen him when he arrived, but as soon as I noticed him he began speaking into his earpiece. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but he didn't look too happy.
Dr. Hachiro turned his attention toward the monitor showing the view from Mars. ""You're aware of course that the mission to colonize the Red Planet has been suspended?"" he said quietly. His voice seemed to catch in his throat and break at the end of the sentence.
My stomach tightened. The news had only been announced a few hours earlier, but now that it was actually happening it felt real. Of course I knew it would eventually happen someday, but hearing it said aloud made it seem final.
He sighed and looked at me. ""As you probably know, the president's original plan was to send four hundred settlers to Mars within ten years. Now, because of budget cuts and other issues, they're only sending twenty-three. That means there won't be any new settlers arriving here anytime soon.""
Dr. Hachiro leaned forward and lowered his voice even further. ""In fact, unless things change drastically in the near future, the entire colonization project may be scrapped entirely. That's what I just found out myself. But before that happens, it seems there are a lot of loose ends to tie up here in Japan. I've been told to take care of them.""
I tried to hide my surprise. The mission to colonize the Red Planet is a government program, and the funding for it comes from the Japanese taxpayers, but that doesn't mean I'm personally responsible for its success or failure. All I do here is work in the medical facility, which is funded by the Japanese military. So if they don't need my help anymore, then it shouldn't matter whether or not they keep paying me. Right?
""Well, what's so important that you had to ask me to join you here?"" I asked. ""I'm sure everyone else is already working on their assignments.""
Dr. Hachiro shook his head. ""We have one more person we need to find a place for. That's all.""
This sounded suspiciously like what they told us would happen when we left Earth: Once we arrive on Mars, we'll each have our own specific task to complete in preparation for settling the planet. But it had never really been made clear exactly who would be assigned what jobs. We'd always assumed that everyone on board would pitch in to carry out various duties.
""And how am I supposed to figure out which of those tasks I'm going to be doing?"" I asked.
The president leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms across his chest. ""Well,"" he said, ""it's possible you'll be assigned your own task, but it's also likely that you'll be helping the others with theirs. I think that's better, actually. After all, you know the colony best.""
The man in the white protective suit continued talking into his device. He was still standing beside the president, but now he was looking directly at me. ""Who is this person you wish us to locate?"" he demanded. ""We must determine his or her identity and whereabouts immediately!""
The president glanced back at him sharply. ""What do you mean 'who'?""
""It matters little if we know 'who,' "" the man answered coldly. ""All we need to know is where they are.""
I frowned, feeling uncomfortable with this man's aggressive tone. The president's eyes narrowed, but he said nothing in response. Then he turned back to me and spoke again. ""If the rest of the team doesn't return before the next supply ship arrives from Earth, then I think it's time we find someone new.""
I sat staring straight ahead. There wasn't much I could say right then. I just kept thinking over everything I knew about the mission, trying to make some sense of what was happening. When I realized that no one was saying anything else to me, I started packing up my things to leave. But before I could stand up, Dr. Hachiro put his hand on my arm and gently pulled me back down into my seat.
""Please wait,"" he whispered. ""Let's finish what we came here to do first.""",1315,-0.31636497837088995,-0.246659330717903,0.19722621252353828,0.7865364851923449,0.5758751287989098
210,R_1o1lHrL2Uuy9FnP,LOW_HR_9,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been working hard to get a little rest before the end of his shift; it was only three hours left before closing time, but she'd somehow managed to keep him awake for them all. The last thing he'd wanted was more trouble after he'd been up half the night with the other customers complaining about being served rotten ale by some lazy bastard who couldn't be bothered to check if it was drinkable or not.
And then she had come along.
He watched as she took a seat at the table opposite of him. There were two others there too, but they seemed so small compared to her. A tall man and a short woman, neither particularly pretty or interesting-looking, but they certainly didn't have much personality to them. They might've looked good together in bed, maybe even better than he and his girlfriend, but that was about it.
She on the other hand...
Her hair was a dark blue color, which made sense since she'd obviously just walked out from a cold ocean. Her skin was also very pale, probably because she didn't see any sun during most of the year. And yet despite this, her figure looked very nice, especially the shape of her ass under those tight black pants she wore. Even though she wasn't wearing any underwear beneath them, he could still make out the outline of her pussy clearly through the fabric. It was quite tempting, actually, and his cock started to grow as he stared at her.
It was then when she turned around and looked at him directly in the eyes. His first impression was that she was angry at him. But then he noticed the way she looked at him. She was staring at him as though she were trying to memorize everything about him. Then, when he realized what exactly she was doing, his mouth went dry, and he felt something warm trickling down his legs.
She's studying me...
""What are you looking at?""
His voice sounded strange in his ears; it seemed like a whisper even though he hadn't whispered anything at all. Yet the other patrons didn't seem to notice any strange sounds coming from the man sitting at the table. If anything, they kept their focus mostly on their drinks and food rather than paying attention to him.
The girl standing in front of him simply smiled and said nothing. Instead she reached up and took a small bag of coins out of her pocket. This seemed to amuse her and she began to laugh. Then suddenly she leaned forward and placed a kiss on his cheek. As she did this she slipped the bag of coins right between her breasts, making sure he would see every bit of it.
He tried to say something, but nothing came out. All he managed to do was stare at her dumbly as she turned around and left the tavern without another word.
Then he heard the clinking sound of metal hitting the floor. He followed the noise until he found himself looking up at her. She'd dropped a gold coin and it had rolled over to him. Without thinking he bent down and picked it up, but then he realized how ridiculous the gesture was. It was just a piece of copper or bronze, and yet he couldn't help but feel proud holding it in his hands. And that wasn't all, either. She seemed happy when he did that.
As if I'm a servant...
He knew that was stupid. After all, who cared whether he got a reward or not? And yet for some reason, he didn't want to give it back to her. No, instead he decided that the best thing would be to ask her why she gave him something so expensive. Maybe she wanted him to go away because he was bothering her, or maybe there was a problem with one of the people she'd brought there before him. Either way, he had a feeling that he'd regret it later if he didn't try to find out what her intentions were.
After giving her one last look, he left the tavern and headed straight for her home. He knew the general direction she lived in from the directions she gave him earlier in the day, but he needed to know exactly how far away it was in order to make his plan work. Once he arrived he knocked on the door several times, but there was no response.
This doesn't make any sense...
She had given him specific instructions on where to go and what to do when he found her house, so there shouldn't be any problem. Still, he waited outside for quite a while before finally opening the door and walking inside. There was no one inside except for him, and that meant he should have been able to talk to her immediately. Yet she didn't appear, so he started looking around the house for clues about why that was.
There were books all over the place, as well as a variety of musical instruments, but that didn't explain why she wouldn't respond to him. In fact, it seemed almost like she was avoiding him. At least, that's what it looked like to him. Then he noticed a set of stairs leading up to the second floor. Perhaps she was upstairs? That seemed plausible, but he still couldn't understand why she didn't answer his knocks.
He climbed the stairs and entered a room on the second floor. There were some clothes scattered throughout the room, along with various personal belongings, but none of them seemed like they were hers. Then he noticed something else, too. A book with a leather cover lying open on one of the beds. And it had her name written on it.
I know this...
He picked it up and looked at it closely. Then, after a brief moment of hesitation, he opened it and saw a picture of the woman standing on a beach. It was the same woman as she'd seen earlier that morning. She was wearing the same clothes, but this time she had her long hair flowing freely down her back. She looked very beautiful, even though it wasn't really clear what happened in the background. All he saw was a small sailboat in the distance.
She's here...
He quickly closed the book and hurried down the stairs, but as soon as he stepped outside, he felt his heart skip a beat. There was a large ship in the harbor with a crew loading barrels onto it. There were men everywhere, but none of them paid any attention to him. And yet, once he noticed that, he also noticed something else. The crewmen weren't wearing uniforms, and yet they all wore swords and daggers at their waist. None of them was armed with anything else. It was obvious to him that they were pirates.
Pirates...
The words ""pirate"" and ""mermaid"" didn't belong in the same sentence together, but there was no doubting it now. That was definitely her ship, and judging by the size of it she must've been the captain.
But how is she doing this?
It didn't make any sense. How could someone be so strong yet so helpless at the same time? How could anyone live their life like that and not become depressed or anxious all the time?",1272,0.8254278166347113,0.6878609617142033,-1.2506310063239354,-0.5561391271851153,0.08074174442237836
211,R_3fTZImFHH2gGzGh,LOW_HOR_5,Horror,Low Rider,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. My eyes went wide as I realized that this wasn't a reflection. The woman smiled at me as she leaned in close so I could smell her sweet scent. She had dark red hair that hung down to about her shoulders and was cut straight across. Her lips were full with red lipstick and her cheeks were rosy. There were two freckles on her nose like she'd been running through a field all day, which would make sense because her skin was tan. As she moved closer, I could see the outline of breasts beneath her white top. They were firm and looked perky as they pushed against the thin fabric of her top. She reached behind her back and pulled open the front button before unclasping it completely and letting it fall to the ground. The rest of her clothes followed soon after revealing herself entirely to me. The black bra covering her breasts only covered them enough for decency. Her panties matched her bra, both coming down just below her ass and ending in small bows. This woman was stunningly beautiful.
""Are you ready?"" she asked with a smile and a wink. ""I can show you things that no one has ever seen."" I was stunned and couldn't believe what I was hearing.
""What is going on here?!"" I yelled as my heart pounded in my chest. I felt like something was trying to escape from inside me. It wanted out! The woman laughed before walking away from the mirror. Before I could run for safety, she turned around and began to strip off her clothes. She didn't take any of them off though. Instead, she just dropped them where they fell. Soon, she stood naked except for her boots.
""You want me now don't you?"" she said as she bent over and grabbed her ankles. She spread her legs apart and raised her ass towards me. ""Do you think about touching my perfect body while you're alone? Do you touch yourself when you're thinking of my lips kissing your shaft?"" I couldn't answer her questions because I wasn't sure if she was talking to me or not. ""Well, then why don't we do this together!"" she said as she sat down on the edge of the tub and slid her hands between her legs. She rubbed her pussy before sliding two fingers inside of her and moving them in and out rhythmically. It was clear that she enjoyed pleasuring herself in front of someone else.
It made me wonder how many times this had happened already and who it had happened with. Did she have a boyfriend or husband? Was it a friend? Did she use sex toys? How long had it been since someone saw her naked? I was so consumed with curiosity that I couldn't look away. I wanted to know more about this woman and how far she would go with me. I had to try and get some answers, but what could I possibly say that would make her trust me enough to tell me everything? If only I could get out without having to hurt myself, I could always find another way. But I was still trapped in the room.
As the woman masturbated, I watched closely and listened. It took me a few seconds to realize what she was saying. She was describing every movement that she made, making it seem like I was watching her through a camera or something. I couldn't move away either because the door wouldn't open from the other side and she could walk right through the walls too. She stopped rubbing herself for a moment and spoke in a soft voice, ""I love when people watch me play with myself. I've never met anyone that I liked so much. I wish you would stay the night, but I'll understand if you need to leave early.""
This was all getting out of hand. What did I get myself into? Maybe I should end this before it gets any worse than this... But she was so damn sexy! And it was obvious she knew how to use her body in ways I couldn't begin to imagine. Plus, I'm sure she's not the only one here. How many others have she been with since I got here? How many men have watched her masturbate and cum? How many women have done the same? She must be an expert because she was giving me such a good show. If she kept up what she was doing, I would probably cum right there on the spot.
""I can't wait anymore,"" she whispered as she continued to rub her fingers inside of herself. She looked like she was about to cum so I decided to stop watching and focus on something else. It didn't take long for my curiosity to get the best of me again though. So I started watching her again, wondering how far she would let me watch her go.
She came pretty fast for someone that was being watched by another person. Her body tensed up as she screamed out her release and shuddered several times before collapsing onto the floor, her fingers still buried deep inside of herself. After a minute, she regained her composure and slowly stood up from the ground. She was covered in sweat and breathing heavily. Her whole body glistened like it had been drenched in water. She walked over to the mirror and looked at herself, checking out her naked body.
""So, are you going to keep staring at me or are you going to join me?"" she asked with a smirk. She was enjoying this too much for my liking.
""If you don't mind, I would love to join you,"" I replied as I stepped closer to the mirror and watched her reaction.
She laughed loudly and slapped her hand over her mouth before turning to me. ""I guess it was too soon to ask that,"" she said smiling. As soon as she turned back towards the mirror, she began to undress again.
""You know, I bet it would feel even better if we were touching each other,"" she said seductively as she slid off her panties and stood completely nude once more. ""But I suppose this will do for now."" She reached behind herself and unclasped her bra, leaving it hanging from her arms. She held her breasts up for me to see before dropping them back down to her sides. Once the bra hit the ground, she bent down and picked it up. She placed it under the sink, presumably to clean later. She turned back to face me and walked over to where I was standing. Then she kneeled down in front of me.
""Now what?"" she asked, leaning forward with her hands on my knees. She smelled incredible. I wondered if she always smelled this nice or if she used perfume. Or maybe something stronger!
""Um..."" I stammered. I wasn't really sure what to do now that she had knelt down so close to me. Her breasts were almost at eye level, and they looked great. Her skin was pale and smooth; her nipples were small and hard against her skin. They were perfectly round and pink, just like the rest of her. I reached out and ran my fingers along one of her nipples, feeling her soft skin with my fingertips.",1285,0.9156990588244387,0.6785378327782424,-0.6423008758319289,0.026540272480056634,0.8025786942072972
212,R_10ShxjRbk2O1JQv,MOR_HF_5,High Fantasy,Morpho,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""The village of Alpina,"" said the man. ""I am told there is a manor house here as well. If you wish to make your way there, I will guide you.""
""Thank you,"" said Rhys.
""We will take you to a place of safety,"" added the man. ""You will be safe there.""
Rhys followed him through the village and then out onto a long, straight road that ran along the shore of the lake. They arrived at a large building that had once been a manor house, but was now falling apart. The roofs had fallen in and much of the wood had rotted. The man led them into the building and left them in front of a set of heavy wooden double doors that stood partially open to the sky. Rhys heard something inside and then the door was closed behind him and locked. He was alone in the abandoned manor house.
""Is this where I am to stay?"" he whispered to himself.
He looked around. A large open room lay before him, with a stone floor and a few crumbling chairs and tables scattered about. There were long windows on one side of the room, and he could see the sun reflecting off the lake beyond. The room was empty except for him.
""I guess I'll be spending my time here,"" he said aloud, ""until someone comes to get me.""
He sat down in one of the chairs and laid his pack down at his feet. There was a fire pit in one corner, with a small heap of wood next to it. He could see a few other doors leading off in different directions, but none were open. The only sounds he could hear were those of birds calling outside and the distant sound of the river as it flowed through the valley below.
""Well,"" he said out loud, ""at least I won't be bored.""
""You have come to take my life,"" said a voice he hadn't heard in many years, ""and with that, your own as well.""
Rhys looked up but saw no one standing in front of him. He got to his feet and looked around but saw no one there either. He walked around the room but saw no one there either. He stood on one side of the room and looked down at his feet, but no one stood there either. He walked over to the other side and looked down at his feet again, but still saw no one there.
""Who are you?"" he called out. ""Where did you come from?""
There was no reply. Rhys went over to one of the doors and tried it but it wouldn't open. He stepped back and tried another but it wouldn't open either. He stepped back and tried another door, then another, and another, but none of them would open for him.
""What are you doing?"" asked the voice again. ""You cannot hide from me.""
Rhys stepped over to the fire pit and pulled some wood out of it and then walked over to another door and tried to open it but it wouldn't move for him. He walked back over to the fire pit and put some more wood on it and then walked back over to another door and tried to open it but it wouldn't move for him either.
""Why won't you let me out?"" he asked as he walked back over to the fire pit and put more wood on it again.
He walked back over to the last door he had tried and pulled it open, but still saw no one there but himself. He stepped back over to the fire pit and put more wood on it just in case someone else came along, then walked back over to the last door he had tried before this one and tried to open it again but it wouldn't move for him either.
""Who are you?"" asked Rhys again, this time more urgently as he tried each door again just in case some other person might be hiding inside them now that he had come this far into the room. When none opened for him, he dropped his hands to his sides where they hung at his sides and waited for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first.
""Why won't you let me out?"" he asked again once more as he stood there waiting for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first. ""Why can't I get out of here?""
Still no one came, though he was sure others were hiding inside all the doors now that he had come this far into their trap. Still he waited, knowing there was no escape now except death itself, except that death would not end his torment if no one else came along before he did so himself. But still no one came....
""Why won't you let me out?"" asked Rhys again as he stood there waiting for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first....
The sun was low in the sky when Rhys finally gave up on trying all the doors in the room and sat down on a fallen chair behind him to wait for someone else to appear so he could kill them before they could kill him first....

Rhys woke up with a start as something slammed into his back with such force that it knocked him forward onto his knees on top of his pack and sent him crashing headlong into an unmoving wall behind him with such force that it knocked most of his teeth loose from his jaw and sent them scattering across the floor at his feet with such force that it left him momentarily stunned with pain as his head spun around from being struck with such force that it knocked out several dozen teeth from his jaw with such force that it left him momentarily stunned with pain....

213,R_rdWNAv4uW4cvjyx,BAS_HR_4,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been so busy that day with all the other customers, but when she left, he couldn't get her out of his mind. Her hair had been long then; now it hung down to her shoulders. It was dark brown streaked with red. The color made her blue eyes stand out even more than they did normally. And those lips—he wanted them on his body.
He'd never seen anyone as beautiful before. When she came back again, he took care not to look directly at her or let her see him staring. But when she smiled at him, he knew he would have to make up his mind about her. He wasn't sure if she could be trusted, though. She looked too innocent for someone who might want to hurt him.
""You're looking at me,"" she said. ""I can tell.""
She was sitting beside him this time, and he didn't know what to say. All he could think about was how good it felt to hold her hand. He hadn't known any women except his mother since he was old enough to remember. His father had died when he was young, leaving only his mother and an older brother to take care of him. They were both gone now, killed by raiders during their travels through the mountains. So he'd lived alone until he'd found work here in the village. Now he had no family, no friends, nothing but himself.
""Do you want to go somewhere?"" he asked her.
""Yes,"" she answered, taking his arm. ""Let's walk along the riverbank.""
They walked away from town together, holding hands, and he told her stories about his life. She listened intently, and he thought maybe there was something special between them. He'd never met anyone like her before.
After they returned to the inn, he went to bed early. In the middle of the night, he woke to find her standing over him.
""What are you doing here?"" he whispered, trying to sound angry.
""I need your help,"" she replied softly. ""Can we talk?""
He got out of bed and followed her outside. She sat down on a log near the firepit. He joined her, then leaned against her shoulder. She smelled good, like flowers and spice.
""Why do you need my help?"" he asked.
""My father is dying,"" she said sadly. ""We don't have much money, but I've saved some of my wages. I want to buy him medicine, but I'm afraid to leave him alone. Will you stay with him tonight? Please?""
""All right,"" he agreed. ""But why should I trust you?""
""Because you don't have anything to lose,"" she said. ""And because I won't hurt you.""
That evening, after the other guests had gone home, he stayed with the man. He slept in a chair next to his bed, and when he woke, the man was still alive. That morning, he helped the woman prepare food for the men working on the new house behind the inn.
""Where did you learn to cook?"" he asked her.
""At my father's farm,"" she said. ""I used to help him every day.""
As he watched her, he noticed how pretty she was, and how she moved. When she turned around, he saw her backside. Then she bent over to pick up something off the floor and he caught another glimpse of her breasts.
""Are you married?"" he asked her.
""No,"" she said. ""I'm a widow.""
""How long has your husband been dead?""
""A little over two years,"" she replied.
""Didn't you remarry?""
""Not yet,"" she admitted. ""I haven't found anyone who makes me feel as safe as I did with my late husband.""
""Have you ever been with a man before?"" he asked.
""Of course,"" she said. ""It's part of being a woman.""
""Is that what you want to do with me?"" he asked.
""Maybe,"" she said. ""If you want to.""
Later that afternoon, when everyone else had gone, he led her into the woods behind the inn. There, they made love. Afterward, she lay naked on top of him, her arms wrapped tightly around him.
""Thank you for staying with my father,"" she whispered. ""I know it must have been hard for you.""
""Don't thank me yet,"" he said. ""There's something you should know.""
""What is it?""
""Your father isn't going to live much longer,"" he said. ""He doesn't have very long to live.""
""Oh!"" she cried. ""I didn't know.""
""I'm sorry,"" he said. ""I wish I could do something to change things, but I can't.""
""Then why did you tell me?""
""I just wanted you to understand how important it was that you stay here with him,"" he explained. ""I'll be back tomorrow to check on him, but I can't promise I'll be able to come back every day.""
""I understand,"" she said. ""I won't bother you anymore.""
When he returned the following day, she was waiting for him.
""I'm ready for you again,"" she said. ""Will you stay with me tonight?""
""I can't,"" he said. ""I promised your father I'd look after him, and I intend to keep my word.""
""You're breaking our agreement,"" she said.
""I know,"" he said. ""But I can't help it. If you really want me to stay, then you'll have to give me something in return.""
""What do you mean?"" she asked.
""You have to sleep with me,"" he said. ""I need to touch you, to hold you, to kiss you.""
""I can't,"" she said. ""I'm already married.""
""I don't care,"" he insisted. ""I want to be with you. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and you smell wonderful. I can't stand to be apart from you.""
""You're crazy,"" she said. ""I can't do that.""
""Please,"" he begged. ""I need you.""
""Okay,"" she relented. ""Tonight. But only once.""
He kissed her and held her close.",1009,-0.35518687410916333,0.6893307750626791,-0.3103399418133087,-1.1886186785654738,-0.8255953607977592
214,R_24Ca0ulTAUydLMn,GEN_HF_8,High Fantasy,Genesis,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is where we will be making camp tonight,"" said Ciri, pointing at one of the towers. ""You can see the road down there. We'll take our horses back to the village to get them stabled.""
""Is this the place?"" asked Geralt, peering around him.
Ciri nodded, then turned away, walking towards the tower, which loomed over the lake as if trying to reach out across the water. She disappeared inside without looking back. Geralt stayed outside for a while longer; he wanted to make sure that her horse hadn't escaped, but eventually the noise coming from within became too much and he went in after her.
He found Ciri sitting on a bench made of wood carved to resemble an enormous tree trunk, eating bread and cheese that she had taken from a sack lying on a table by the wall. The smell of roasting meat reached his nostrils even before he stepped through the door. He followed it into a room almost identical to the one where they'd eaten last night.
""I didn't know you could cook,"" said Geralt, watching as Ciri took another piece of bread from the basket and bit into it hungrily.
She stopped chewing and looked up at him. ""When I lived here, I would often help my mother with the cooking. In all honesty, I wasn't very good at it. But now that I've been living alone I have learned how to prepare enough food for myself so that I don't go hungry.""
""And yet you were willing to share your supplies with me.""
Ciri shrugged. ""The truth is that I like you. And I'm glad that I met you. You're different from those who surround me, Geralt. For a long time now I haven't felt that way about anyone else.""
Geralt put his hand on her shoulder. ""That's nice to hear."" He paused and looked around as if considering something. At length he stood up. ""Are you hungry, Ciri?""
She shook her head. ""No."" She pushed herself off the bench, got unsteadily to her feet, then leaned against the wall. Her face was pale and drawn; her eyes looked hollow. ""I'm exhausted. I don't feel well. Do you think I could lie down for a little while?""
""Of course,"" said Geralt. ""But don't go anywhere. If you need anything, just shout.""
Ciri smiled. ""Thank you.""
Her voice sounded strange, distant and hollow. Geralt couldn't stop himself from staring at her.
""Don't worry about me,"" she added. ""Go and eat. There are plenty of things left.""
For a moment he thought he saw a faint trace of sadness in her expression, but then it vanished and she turned away.
""All right,"" he said, giving her one last look before leaving the room.
Outside he found his horse tethered to the railings on the lakeside. He mounted the animal and rode slowly towards the town, scanning the area carefully all the way. Finally he reached the gates, which stood open and unguarded. The guardsmen were nowhere to be seen.
Geralt dismounted outside the gatehouse and walked over to one of the soldiers' barracks. Inside he heard the sound of a rousing fight being played out. A man with a moustache was beating a young boy mercilessly. The boy tried to defend himself with a dagger, but the soldier kicked it out of his hand, then grabbed the boy by the throat and squeezed. His knuckles whitened as he crushed the child's windpipe.
""Hey!"" shouted Geralt, running into the barracks.
The soldier turned towards him, then let go of the boy and stepped back. He regarded Geralt warily. ""What do you want?""
""A word.""
""With me?""
Geralt nodded.
The soldier moved aside, gesturing Geralt to follow him. They went into the next room, where a group of men in armour were playing dice.
""This is my friend Albrecht,"" said the soldier. ""He's the captain of these walls.""
Albrecht turned away from the window and gave Geralt a quick glance. ""So? What is it?""
Geralt ignored him. ""Where are the guardsmen?""
""They're not here. Some of them went to fetch fresh water, others set off to hunt game. We have no idea when they will be back. Why?""
Geralt hesitated. He had been hoping that the situation would change once he arrived, but it appeared that there wouldn't be any. No one was going to come looking for Ciri until the soldiers returned. Not unless someone came to tell them what had happened.
""Someone has to come to find me,"" he said. ""Right now there's only one person who knows that I'm here.""
Albrecht threw him a sharp look. ""Are you saying that you aren't alone?""
""No.""
""Who is it?""
Geralt looked at his feet. ""A girl... Ciri.""
""Ciri!""
""Yes. She's a witcher and she's been searching for me for a long time.""
""Why?""
""Because..."" Geralt trailed off.
""Wait a minute,"" said Albrecht. ""If she's a witcher, why did she need to search for you? Didn't she know where you were?""
""Well...""
""It sounds like a lie to me. I don't believe you.""
""Then you shouldn't,"" said Geralt shortly. ""But you should listen to what I'm telling you. This isn't the first time I've come across a witcher. They're people who seek out and kill monsters, and protect humans from the threat of evil. Witchers are dangerous, unpredictable, and very powerful.""
Albrecht looked at him suspiciously. ""Are you sure about this? How can you be so certain that this is a witcher?""
Geralt hesitated. ""There's something odd about her. Something different. There's something special about her. They say that when a witcher finds someone to bond with, they become completely absorbed in each other. That's what happened between her and me. We became... more than friends.""
""More than friends,"" repeated Albrecht. ""How many of these witchers are there? Maybe this girl is simply one of them.""
""She's not a witcher,"" said Geralt quietly. ""I'm sure of it.""
Albrecht stared at him. ""Really?""
Geralt nodded.
Albrecht shrugged. ""Okay, then. If you're so convinced, let me ask you something.",1085,-0.7982481948638203,-0.5248088850096064,0.08751035284910037,-0.06356366406771664,-0.8163796612965785
215,R_1PbFXwjkrEm2mb4,GEN_HOR_9,Horror,Genesis,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It smiled a horrible grin. I screamed and slammed my hand down on the mirror, shattering it. The man in the mirror stared back at me as if nothing had happened.
I ran out of the room screaming for help but when I reached the living area, everyone was gone. After I sat down in the armchair, I fell asleep.
The next time I woke up, I noticed that something was very wrong with my body. My legs were much longer than normal and my hands seemed abnormally large. As I stood up, I realized that everything was abnormally large. Everything was a lot bigger. Even my head was huge and it felt like it weighed more than it should have.
When I saw myself in the mirror, I froze in shock. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The reflection of myself was terrifyingly similar to a monster from one of my favorite horror movies.
The creature in the mirror was ten feet tall and covered in black fur except for its face which resembled the mask of death. Its teeth were long and sharp like fangs. Its eyes glowed red and they were fixed on my own. The beast's skin was scaly and covered in yellow veins. Just looking at it made me feel sick.
Before I knew what I was doing, I lifted up my shirt and pulled off my bra. A large set of breasts hung free from underneath and jiggled slightly as I moved. They were so big that even with the padding, it still hurt to move them around. I reached between my legs and stroked the furry hair that covered my pussy. I gasped when I felt how hard my clit was beneath it.
As I rubbed my pussy, I felt the urge to cum and I did just that. My whole body shook uncontrollably as I climaxed. When I finished, I looked at my reflection again and saw that it wasn't moving. It just stared back at me.
Suddenly, the mirror shattered. The monster in the mirror turned to look at me before it started to run toward me. I screamed and tried to get away but it was too fast. With every step it took, the ground below began to shake. Soon, the entire house was shaking. I could hear things breaking all around me. It sounded like the whole world was crashing down on top of us. I lost sight of the monster in the mirror for a few seconds but when I looked back, he was right behind me.
He grabbed me by the neck and lifted me into the air. He held me upside-down and squeezed his hands together until I passed out.
When I awoke later, I didn't know where I was or how I'd gotten there. I was lying on a table in a strange room. There were other girls here in the same condition as me. We were all naked and tied down to the table. All of us had long hair and huge tits and our faces and bodies were covered with thick fur. Every inch of me was covered in black hair except for my face, mouth, arms, and legs. My toes and fingers had become clawed and ended in sharp points.
There was a woman standing next to me who looked at all of us with disgust. She was about six foot tall and she had dark brown hair. Her breasts were small and her stomach was flat, but she was still pretty hot in a scary way.
""Well, well, well,"" she said in a voice that was low and deep. ""If it isn't my little friends.""
The woman approached me and examined my body closely. She sniffed me and then licked my ear. She was licking my ears!
""Who are you?"" I asked her.
She laughed and slapped me across the face. Then she grabbed my hair and forced my head to the side. She stuck her tongue into my ear and pulled out a long string of mucous.
""You're disgusting!"" I yelled.
""Oh, shut your trap and listen, freak,"" the woman told me angrily. ""We've been waiting a long time for you all to wake up. You see, we need you to do something special. Something important.""
""What is it?"" I asked.
""Soon, you will be ready to do whatever we say. But until then, we must teach you how to behave properly. That means no talking unless we tell you to. And no laughing. Do you understand?""
""Yes,"" I answered quietly.
""Good girl. Now, do you know why all of you have been brought here? What has happened to you?""
""No,"" I replied. ""I don't know anything.""
""That's not true. Don't lie to me, now. You know exactly what has happened to you. Your bodies have changed. In a few minutes, you'll remember what's going on. You'll start to change. You'll grow fur and claws and your voices will become deeper. I can feel it happening already. Soon, you won't even recognize yourselves anymore. Well, except for me of course. I'm special.""
""Why are you different?"" I asked.
""Because I am special. I was born like this. I used to be a normal human being, but now I'm a freak. You're lucky to be alive. Most of these girls weren't. Their bodies died during their transformation. Only a few of them survived. Some of them only had to go through the process once. Others went through it twice. Those poor girls never came back. They became monsters.
""Do you want to live or die? If you do, you'll obey me and do whatever I ask of you. It doesn't matter to me whether you live or die. I could care less. All that matters is what I think. So, choose wisely.""
""What are you going to make us do?"" I asked.
""Whatever I want. Whatever I feel like. You'll have no choice but to follow my orders. I'm in charge here, and you'll do what I say. Understand?""
""Yes,"" I answered. ""I understand. I'll do anything you say.""
""Good. Now, take off your clothes and let me examine you. You may as well get used to the idea of having sex with other girls while you still have a choice.""
I stripped off my clothes and she examined me for a second. Then she picked me up and carried me to the center of the room. She put me down on my knees and tied me to the floor with some rope.
""Now, I'm going to show you how to fuck. You're going to learn how to pleasure men with your mouth and ass. Once you've learned how to please a man, you'll be ready to fuck him. But you need to do it properly. Otherwise, you might kill him.""
""Kill him?"" I asked. ""How can I possibly do that?""

216,R_2EfWM8mh3baQgP7,OUR_HOR_1,Horror,Ouroboros,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. A man's face, but it was too wide. The nose was too big and the jawline looked wrong.
""Who are you?"" I asked in English, not even sure if my voice came out in French or Spanish. ""Where am I?""
""You're in France,"" the face replied in a heavy accent. He said something else I didn't understand and I got a shiver down my spine when he smiled at me. It was an evil smile that sent chills up my arms. He must've been quite old because his hair had long gray strands in it. It was hard for me to see him through the reflection, but I could tell he had dark bags under his eyes.
""Where is here?"" I asked again.
""This is the castle of Jean-Baptiste DuBois,"" the old man said. ""You are in the mirror and the mirror is where you will stay forever.""
I started screaming then, but my voice did not come out in English or Spanish. All I could do was scream until my throat hurt. Finally, I ran out into the hallway and called 911. A few minutes later, they arrived with two police officers who were armed and ready for anything.
""Is everything all right? What happened?"" the female officer asked me.
I pointed to the mirror.
""A man's face has appeared in my mirror,"" I said. ""He says he is from France and is going to kill me if I don't come with him.""
The male officer grabbed me by the arm and tried to pull me out of the room.
""Let her go!"" the old man screamed at him.
When he did, the woman took off running. The man followed her out of the room and they both disappeared down the hallway.
The male officer helped me out of the room and told me to stay put as he searched the whole place for anyone else. After a while, the female officer came back and he led her to the mirror in the bathroom.
""What do you see?"" she asked.
""Just another mirror,"" he replied. ""There's no one behind it.""
We stood there staring at the mirror.
""Maybe he's gone now,"" the officer said.
""Not him,"" the woman insisted. ""That man isn't here anymore. It's him.""
She pointed to the mirror and I turned around. I knew who that was. I saw him through the reflection as he had appeared in the mirror. He smiled at me before he left, but I didn't think about it then. We finished searching the house and were leaving when we heard footsteps coming from the stairs. The woman jumped into the hallway, gun aimed at the intruder. When she realized it was just a young man in his twenties, she lowered the weapon.
""Sir, what are you doing in this house?"" she demanded to know.
""I'm looking for the owner,"" the young man said. ""I've been locked in my bedroom since last night.""
She stared at him for a moment.
""You're an idiot!"" she yelled. ""How can you not have heard any of our search? How could you even think to come in here without us knowing it?""
He looked confused by her response.
""I thought I might be able to get away unnoticed,"" he said.
I was watching the scene with great interest because I was sure that this guy was going to be the real killer.
""And how did you think you would do that?"" she asked. ""Didn't you hear the woman screaming in there?""
He shook his head and I couldn't understand why he would try to sneak up on anyone in a house that was clearly occupied.
""What do you mean?"" he asked.
""Listen to me,"" she said. ""The lady in that room has been stabbed over and over again, and you came up here as if it was the safest place you could be. You're a fool! The only reason I didn't shoot you right then and there is because I thought it might be your brother.""
""My brother?"" he replied.
""Yeah, Jean-Baptiste DuBois, and don't tell me you forgot who he is. You've been dreaming about him since yesterday.""
The young man shook his head.
""I haven't thought about any of that in a while, and I wouldn't dream about him if I did. He's dead.""
""Dead?"" the female officer asked. ""What happened to him?""
""He's dead because of me. He was my best friend back at school. We used to run together and even went to college together. That was when it all started. One day, he called me up and asked if he could stay with me. When I told him yes, he told me he wanted to take a trip to Paris.""
""Paris?"" the female officer asked. ""Why would he want to go there?""
The young man shrugged.
""He said he'd fallen in love with the city and had always wanted to visit. He planned on going for three days before returning home. That's what we were supposed to do, but I got so caught up in everything else that I forgot to mention anything about my friend. That's when I realized he hadn't returned. He didn't call me back or send me an email, so I tried calling him several times. After that, I drove around looking for him but never found him. That's when I started getting worried. I searched everywhere in Paris but could never find him. Finally, I had to accept the fact that he was dead. That was the day he died.""
I was stunned by what this young man said, and the woman didn't seem to believe him.
""Are you sure he wasn't kidnapped?"" she asked.
The young man shook his head.
""No! He left because of me!"" he shouted. ""If I hadn't made the mistake of telling him he could stay with me, then he would still be alive and happy.""
The female officer stared at him for a long time.
""Where is he?"" she asked finally.
The young man looked at her.
""Where did you get that mirror?"" he asked. ""And what does it have to do with everything?""
She didn't answer.
""You're an American,"" he said. ""Do you speak French?""
She nodded.
""Then ask him if he knows how to get to a place called Montmartre.""
She turned to look at me and I just stared back.
""Do you know where this man lives?"" she asked.
""He doesn't live here,"" I replied.
""Then who do you think we should search?""
I shrugged.
""You should look everywhere,"" the young man said. ""Because you can never be too safe.""
I started shaking my head, but before I knew it, the door to my room opened and two men wearing ski masks barged in.",1176,-1.0121673890014775,0.27179025763420295,1.1694124047848176,-0.014346276250971299,-1.637999981770866
217,R_10NScrVnq67itPE,FAN_HF_1,High Fantasy,Fandango,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. The road that led there had clearly seen better days, the ground littered with potholes large enough to swallow an ox cart whole. They were all three silent as they approached. The only sound came from their feet crunching across rocks and gravel, the sound of the river, wind whipping across the mountaintops, and even the rustling of leaves in the trees above.
Dorian paused a moment before going into the village proper. He turned to face his companions. ""You may want to go on inside. I need to talk with them, alone.""
""Is something wrong?"" asked Dariana. She sounded genuinely concerned. ""I would feel better if one of us stayed outside.""
He shook his head. ""No,"" he said, ""it's nothing like that. This is just going to be hard for me. I didn't expect this to happen so soon.""
""All right, then,"" she replied. She looked at him a moment longer, as though she knew what was coming but wasn't sure how to handle it. She started toward the nearest tower. ""But hurry back, Dorian! We'll be waiting in the carriage.""
""Thank you,"" he said quietly and went into the village. He found himself walking among empty buildings as he passed through a narrow, winding path between stone walls and low wooden shacks. A large bell tower stood ahead and to the left, its bell sounding out a single peal. He could see a sign hanging from the top of the tower, which read ""Vyenn"" in a bold, black-lettered hand.
The bell stopped ringing as soon as he entered the village proper. Dorian could see the reason for this; a large crowd, most of whom were staring at him in surprise, stood near the entrance to the town hall. Some of them started forward to get a closer look, but others moved quickly to block their way.
Dorian ignored them. There was a man dressed as a soldier sitting at a table by himself a few yards away, wearing the red and yellow markings of House Arcona. He was reading a book of some kind, completely ignoring the others. Two guards stood nearby, also keeping an eye on the people in the room. The rest of the villagers appeared to be waiting patiently for someone to come take their orders.
Dorian walked over to the soldier and spoke quietly. ""I am here to speak to you. To my surprise, I find that I do not have a choice in the matter."" The man looked up curiously and stood from his seat.
""I'm afraid you don't. I will speak with him. If he refuses, we'll have no choice but to escort you back to your ship.""
Dorian nodded. ""That is fine. I must speak with him anyway.""
""Then go ahead,"" said the soldier, indicating for Dorian to follow him.
Dorian waited until he was alone before approaching the soldier. He stood close behind him, watching silently and trying to gauge his thoughts. It seemed that there was something very important about this that the soldier did not yet know. Dorian didn't think that was possible, however. Everyone who had been waiting in line knew why he had come here, and they were all clearly curious to hear him out.
""Who are you?"" asked the soldier. ""And why can I not leave?""
Dorian smiled grimly. ""I am a friend of the princess, and I came with her to tell you where she is.""
""And why do you need to know?""
""Because you'll be leaving here very shortly.""
There was a short silence. ""What do you mean?"" the man finally asked.
""Princess Amara has been taken away, and we have come to take her home.""
""By force, I assume. I have always believed myself to be a reasonable man, and I am prepared to give you what help I can. But I must know why you wish to take my wife.""
Dorian felt his throat tighten up. How was he going to explain this? He was tempted to let the soldier guess at the truth. He doubted anyone would notice if that were the case, and it would save him from having to explain Amara's kidnapping. Unfortunately, that would only result in this entire situation blowing up in his face, because then Dorian would have to admit to his involvement. If he couldn't convince the Arconan of his innocence, he would never be able to prove it.
He decided to just come out and say it. ""The princess is the queen's daughter, and she is being held hostage.""
The man stared at him for a long time, as if he hadn't expected Dorian to say anything else. Finally, he said, ""What?""
Dorian nodded. ""It was her mother, your wife, Princess Alaura, who took her.""
""My wife,"" repeated the soldier. ""You're saying... that means—""
""Princess Amara is in danger. Her life may depend on the outcome of this.""
The soldier was silent for several seconds. Then he turned to face him directly. ""She is my wife, and I love her dearly. But she made a terrible mistake, as I have told you before. You must understand that I cannot allow her to risk herself any further. I have already lost her once. I will not lose her again.""
""We will keep her safe!"" Dorian said urgently. ""For now, we need to get her somewhere secure, where no one else knows about it. We need to hide her away from everyone who knows her, including yourself.""
""Hiding her will not make a difference,"" the soldier replied. ""Even if I could trust you to keep her hidden, the truth of the matter is that I will never let her go. She is my wife. If it comes down to the matter, I will stop you from doing whatever is necessary to get her away.""
""You're right,"" Dorian admitted softly. ""I will not be able to get her off of this island without causing a great deal of trouble. I wish things were different, but they are not. So you must know that when we return to our ship, we will take everything we can with us and be gone in the blink of an eye. If you want to see your wife alive, you will give me her location. If not, you had better be certain you are ready for us to leave.""
There was a long pause before the man answered. ""I am sorry, Dorian, but I can never go against the wishes of my queen. She has been good to me and my family. I cannot deny her anything, even if it means risking the lives of those around me.""
""I'm afraid that there isn't much time,"" Dorian reminded him. ""Your wife has just barely enough to last her another day or two. After that, she will certainly die.""",1210,0.7980529639789331,-0.21815014174663852,0.5596629402162958,0.5244767331814106,0.7701392148903481
218,R_22y8lSzUXXuXBGw,ALL_HR_5,Historical Romance,All-Nighter,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He couldn't tell who she was; only that she wore a shapeless, baggy black dress that made her look even larger than she was.
He tried to ignore her, but every time he looked up from cleaning the glasses, she seemed to be looking right at him. He thought perhaps it was because she wanted a drink. When he went over to serve her, he found out why. She was so drunk she could hardly walk, and he had to help her to a stool.
She stared at him with eyes that were filled with sadness, as if she was waiting for something, but when he offered her water instead of ale, she smiled a little and thanked him. He didn't think much about it until she came back several more times and each time she looked sadder. It was almost as if she knew what would happen next, and that she had accepted it.
Then, one morning, while he was making breakfast, he heard the door slam shut behind her and he went to see who it was. As soon as she saw him, she began sobbing.
""I'm sorry,"" she said, ""please don't leave me.""
He took her hand and led her to the table where they had first met. She fell into his arms and cried on his chest. He stroked her hair, trying not to think of how soft and pretty it felt.
When she finally stopped crying, she sat up and looked into his face.
""Do you know who I am?"" she asked.
He shook his head. ""No, I've never seen you before.""
She smiled then, and he could see the tears in her eyes.
""My name is Elisa, and I'm here to marry you,"" she said.
His mind reeled with disbelief, but he nodded. ""Yes, of course,"" he said.
Elisa reached into her pocket and pulled out a small wooden box. She opened it and there inside was a ring. She placed it on his finger and held his hand.
""Please don't cry,"" she said.
He took her in his arms and held her.
""I can't do this anymore,"" she said. ""I have to go back now.""
He kissed her cheek and held her tight. ""I'll wait for you,"" he said.
And so he waited. It was a long year before she returned, but when she did, she brought with her another ring and a child. He had never seen either before, but they were both beautiful.
""This is our son,"" she said.
The baby's face was pale and smooth like marble. He seemed to be sleeping, but he made a little sound as Elisa put him in his crib. Then, when Elisa went to sit down, the baby opened his eyes and smiled at her. She looked back at the baby and laughed.
""He knows who I am,"" she said.
""What do you mean?"" he asked.
She shook her head. ""That's not important. You should take him upstairs and rest.""
He did as she suggested, but as soon as he laid him down, he began to cry.
""He has a fever,"" she said. ""I'll be back in a little while.""
She left the room and he sat up with the baby, rocking him gently. After a few minutes, the baby quieted down and fell asleep. He felt so tired and he knew that it must be because he hadn't slept for so long. When the baby cried again, he got up and tried to rock him, but the baby only screamed louder. He couldn't stand it anymore and he picked him up. As he held him, he noticed a mark on his forehead where he'd been scratched. He held him against his chest, hoping the baby would calm down, but instead of calming down, he became more agitated.
""What's wrong with him?"" he asked.
Elisa came back into the room, her face pale.
""He's not feeling well,"" she said. ""I don't think he should be left alone.""
""But I can take care of him,"" he said. ""You have to go and rest.""
""No,"" she said. ""If he's sick, then I need to stay with him.""
She sat down next to him and took his hand. He was about to speak when suddenly there were footsteps behind them. The door opened and two men came inside, both wearing black robes. One of them carried a tray with a bottle and glass on it and the other one a silver bowl. They poured the contents of the bottle into the bowl, then stirred it with a stick.
The liquid began to bubble and Elisa stood up quickly. ""Stop!"" she shouted, ""that's my blood.""
One of the men put the bowl to his lips and drank, but when he pulled the bowl away, the man was dead.
The other man smiled. ""He died from poison,"" he said, ""but we have something better in store for you.""
Elisa shook her head and tried to pull the robe over her head, but the other man pulled her arm and held it tight. She struggled and kicked at him, but he held her fast.
""Please,"" she said. ""You can't do this.""
He took a knife out of his sleeve and pressed it against her throat.
""I don't have a choice,"" he said. ""You are the reason he is suffering. We need your blood to save him.""
He took the ring from her hand and slipped it onto his finger. It had become hard and cold. He put it on the baby's finger too and it seemed to make him feel better. The baby stopped crying and began to smile again. Then they took her by the arms and led her to the bed.
""Don't hurt me,"" she begged.
He nodded. ""I'm sorry,"" he said.
Then he cut her arm with the knife. As soon as he did, Elisa began screaming.
""It hurts so much!"" she cried.
He picked up a jar with a long neck and squeezed the thick blood out of her arm into the glass. The blood swirled and frothed until there was nothing left in the jar.
""This will be enough to cure him,"" he said. ""Now I'll go and fetch your husband.""
When he came back, the baby was smiling and seemed well again, but Elisa lay on the bed, her eyes closed. She looked dead. He touched her cheek and then saw her lips were moving.
""Don't leave me,"" she whispered.
He tried to wake her up, but she didn't stir. When he looked into her eyes, they were filled with fear.
""Why?""",1134,-1.233786040917287,0.4113354973539153,-0.11840752297344584,-1.1400391007853303,0.5630217211290918
219,R_1rABEAQ2Sn8XgbK,OUR_HSF_8,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The air was warm and clear, and I breathed deeply of it as I walked back to my car.
There was no reason to be late today, since there would only be a handful of people present when the president delivered his message. As far as I knew, he wasn't planning to fire me yet, but I still didn't want to take any chances. I quickly drove across the city to reach the presidential complex and parked at the underground garage. There were three elevators in the center of the huge building, and I took the one on the left that led directly up to the top floor. I checked my watch—2:30 pm—then followed the sign for President Wu's office. A few minutes later I stepped into a large room full of cubicles. A single woman sat behind a desk, looking up at me as I entered.
""Dr. Sato gave you the message, right?"" she said.
I nodded.
""Let me get your ID card,"" she said, reaching for the badge clip hanging around my neck. I handed it over, and she swiped it through the computer mounted on her desk. The light above the desk turned green, and the woman smiled.
""You're in luck,"" she said. ""The president's actually here right now. Do you mind coming with me? We'd like to see you before we send the message down to the lab.""
It took only a few seconds to find my way out of the room and through another security checkpoint before walking into a conference room where the president, Dr. Sato, and four others were already waiting for me. As soon as the door shut behind us, Dr. Wu stood up and walked across the room towards me. I rose to stand at attention, and waited while he reached out his hand to shake mine.
""Doctor, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. And thank you for taking the time to come all the way up here from Mars,"" the president said, squeezing my hand once before letting go. The meeting room was so large, I had a clear view of everyone sitting around the table. They were all well dressed and looked relaxed—at least as much as any group of people can be when there are armed soldiers standing just outside the door. I recognized two of them—Sergeant Carrington and Private Jacobson—who were part of the president's security team. The rest of the people in the room I didn't know. A young man and a woman sat on either side of President Wu; both appeared to be his aides or assistants.
""Thank you for seeing me,"" I said, bowing my head slightly as I spoke. ""I'm very glad to see that our cooperation is continuing, and that we're still able to meet on such an informal basis.""
Dr. Sato leaned forward slightly. ""I also appreciate the fact that you came all the way up here,"" she said. ""It shows real initiative, and speaks well of your work ethic.""
""Of course,"" I replied. ""This is my home, after all. And I have no wish to offend my friends and colleagues here by being late.""
The president smiled at me, and I knew then that I had made the correct choice to accept his job offer. He was a warm and friendly man who was very open to ideas. It took only a few seconds for him to confirm that I could work out a long-term contract with him that would guarantee my salary, plus a bonus, plus my share of the research fund.
""Good,"" he said. ""I was hoping that you'd say that. In fact, we're actually going to be giving you a raise.""
""Really?"" I said. ""Are you sure? It's already twice what I earned at the lab.""
""Of course. I want you to be happy working for me, and I know that your loyalty to the mission will never waver. You can take the money and run if you want. We won't be able to stop you, since it would mean war, but the offer will always be available for you if you ever change your mind.""
""I think not,"" I replied. ""Your offer is most generous, and I thank you for your faith in my abilities.""
""Now I do have one question,"" said Dr. Sato, leaning forward to address the president. ""You know how much we value your expertise, and you know how important this project is to all of us. Why are you so anxious to get the researchers in Mars off the island? I mean, you've given us plenty of warning that you were coming, but you're still taking them all away.""
""I don't like to talk about politics,"" said President Wu. ""It's not my job. But I think I can answer your question. You'll understand why when I show you something. Come with me, please."" He stood up and motioned towards the door. Carrington and Jacobson moved to stand behind him as he walked past. The three of them formed a line in front of the president, and I followed after him. We turned the corner at the end of the long room, then stepped into a large conference room just down the hall. I saw an even larger room with a set of double doors opposite the door we had come through. I'd seen this before, but it was always locked and rarely used. As we approached the doors, the president knocked on them lightly, and they slowly opened. We entered the room, where President Wu pushed the red button under his desk. It took a moment for the door to close behind us. When it finally did, I could hear the hum of an air conditioner above our heads.
""The main air conditioning system on the island isn't working,"" said the president, turning towards the control panel built into one wall. ""This room gets very hot during the day. So when I want to give someone a surprise, this is the only way I can do it. Would you mind if we closed the door?""
He waited for a response, then hit the button again and turned to me. ""Dr. Sato gave you my message about the meeting with the president, right?"" he asked. ""Well, what she didn't tell you was that we also have an appointment with the Council.""
I nodded, and he smiled. ""We need to speak to the council before we take any action. We're still waiting for their reply."" He turned back towards the control panel. ""The room isn't sealed—not completely. I'm sure we'll be allowed to leave before long, but I can't risk anyone finding out about this. If they knew, all of us would lose our jobs. Do you understand?""
""I think so,"" I said. ""Why do you need the meeting with the council?""
President Wu chuckled at the look on my face. ""Because they own us,"" he said. ""They pay our salaries and keep us employed, even though most of us are only doing menial tasks that aren't useful to anyone.",1239,1.215405163329883,2.0329064619714177,0.5327460134889254,1.0336653363257067,1.435718231346619
220,R_vJKgFu9idCMBGCZ,LOW_HR_7,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The man's wife had been murdered and she was there to find out what the murderer looked like so that she could give her husband justice.
He'd never seen anyone so beautiful before. Tall and lithe, with long flowing blonde hair and bright blue eyes that shone like stars, she made him feel as if he was nothing more than dirt beneath her feet. He wanted to touch her skin, run his hands over her body until he felt those breasts under his palms, or better yet bury his nose in her neck and breathe deep the sweet scent of woman. It was as if someone had poured ice water down his back when he realized it wasn't a man sitting next to the pretty woman but a young woman who should have been his age. His mind was filled with a thousand images of him touching her, kissing her, loving her in ways that would make them both scream out with joy. He was a monster for even thinking such things about his own flesh and blood.
She left the tavern, telling him she needed to be alone to think. The image of her face stayed in his mind and tormented him every day. Her beauty had stolen his heart right from his chest. Every single time he closed his eyes all he could see was her.
After a time, she appeared again and came to his table. She sat down across from him and stared straight into his eyes without blinking once. ""I can't stop thinking about you,"" she said simply.
""And why is that?""
Her smile was radiant as she answered, ""Because I know what you are.""
He shook his head, confused. ""You do?""
""I'm a Hunter. My name is Talia. What's your name?""
He knew exactly how she knew what he was. ""My name is Gabriel. You must have heard of me.""
She smiled sadly, ""Yes, everyone has heard of you. You're famous around here. Everyone is terrified of you. There is no hope for us ever being together. If we were to get involved, there would be nothing good in our lives.""
He tried to hide his hurt by changing the subject. ""What makes you think that?""
""I've read many stories about Hunters and I've also heard what you did in the last battle against the evil King of Shadows.""
Gabriel nodded, ""I was only trying to save my people from slavery.""
Her voice took on an angry edge. ""But you killed hundreds of innocent men women and children because they were in the way of your fight. Is that really what you call saving them? You don't seem to care at all about what happened after the war ended.""
His voice softened as he explained, ""I know that's true but I have to keep them safe at all costs. There are too few of us to let anything happen to one of us.""
She stood up, tears in her eyes. ""Then you need to kill yourself. There are far too many bad memories for me now that I know what you are.""
Before Gabriel could say another word, she vanished. He went to find her later that night, determined that he wouldn't leave her side unless she was dead. He found her walking down the street towards a large building. He ran to catch up with her as quickly as he could, not wanting her to leave his sight again.
Once inside the building, she walked through the darkness to a small room that housed an enormous bed with dark red sheets. A beautiful woman lay on top of the covers, her head pillowed in Gabriel's lap while his fingers ran through her silken hair. Her eyes fluttered open slowly but didn't focus as they rested on him.
Talia watched silently as Gabriel gently lifted the woman's arm off the bed and put it around his shoulders. As soon as he touched her, she pulled away from him. ""Don't touch me!"" Her voice was cold as ice.
Talia turned around and began to walk away.
Gabriel called out to her in a gentle voice, ""Talia please wait, I want to speak to you.""
Her eyes snapped open and her anger grew. ""What do you want?""
He reached out and grabbed her hand, holding it tightly so that she couldn't pull away. ""You can't just leave, I won't allow it.""
She jerked her hand from his and screamed, ""I hate you! I despise you for being the monster everyone thinks you are and you still expect me to stay with you forever? No way! Never again will I be near you.""
Talia turned and stormed out the door leaving him behind. He sat in the chair, stunned. He didn't even try to stop her as she hurried away from him. It wasn't long before he lost sight of her completely.
It's been months since then. Gabriel has searched for any trace of her but has yet to find her. When he thought he saw her earlier tonight he ran after her only to learn she was nowhere to be found. He knows this is all part of his destiny; the Hunter and the woman he loves will never meet. But he still has hope that one day he will find her again.
He sighed and shook his head, wishing the night would end quickly so that he could go home and get some rest. Gabriel walked to the door of the tavern and paused, suddenly remembering what had brought him here in the first place.
""What's wrong?"" The innkeeper asked in alarm.
""Nothing,"" Gabriel replied, looking around to see if anyone else was paying attention to him. He opened the door and stepped outside. He looked both ways down the empty street then slipped into the shadows between two buildings.
His footsteps crunched against the loose gravel as he hurried towards the river. He crossed the bridge carefully and kept going, his heart pounding in his ears. He moved as quietly as he could, not wanting to scare away the animals that lived there. Once on the other side, he followed the path that led to the old ruins.
As he approached the entrance to the ancient cave, Gabriel heard voices coming from the shadows. He listened closely and recognized the sound of a man and a woman arguing.
""You need to tell me where she is,"" the man demanded angrily.
""I don't know,"" a soft voice whispered in response.
""How can you not know? Have you gone blind? Or maybe your brains have turned to mush?""
The woman was afraid of the angry man and was desperately trying to avoid confrontation. ""Please, let's talk about this somewhere else. I'm begging you.""
""We need to settle things right now,"" the man continued. ""I want you to tell me where she is.""
""No!"" she yelled, throwing herself down onto the ground. ""I can't betray my friends.""
Gabriel crept closer, his eyes focused on the couple. They seemed to be arguing about something very important and the woman sounded like she was hiding something big from him.
""Your friend isn't really your friend anymore,"" he growled.
""Stop saying that!"" the woman cried, struggling to stand up against him. ""Why do you keep insisting on hurting her?",1255,0.8571822901655156,1.7414600117990522,-0.50381747752366,-0.30268758494779474,-0.6807179102828721

The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is where we will begin,"" said Lord Vellorin, his face set in a grim expression as he led them down the path that ran along the water's edge towards the town. ""If you are willing to put your lives on the line then I can promise you this; there will be no one else here who can help us."" He paused and glanced back at his men before continuing. ""I would prefer if only those who were truly dedicated to this quest joined us but we cannot force anyone. If someone wants nothing more than to live a simple life without being drawn into these troubles then so be it. You have my thanks for even coming here today. We shall make sure everyone gets what they want in return for joining our cause.""
Lord Vellorin led them around the shore until they came to an area of the shoreline that had been cleared of underbrush. Here stood a large stone structure that was easily three times the height of a man and almost twice as long. From its base rose several tall pillars that reached upwards towards the heavens and ended in a great dome above which floated a single enormous crystal that shimmered with an inner light.
""We call this place the Temple of Light,"" said Lord Vellorin as he walked past them. ""It was built by the people of the city of D'Rhin many years ago but now it stands empty except for a few priests who come here once a year to cleanse the crystals and perform the rituals needed to keep them intact. There is also a room beneath the temple that contains the heartstone that keeps the power flowing through it and a small chamber behind that which houses the book of prophecies."" He stopped just inside the doorway and turned to look at his men. ""Are you ready?""
They nodded silently as they stared ahead into the darkness within the temple. They could hear the sounds of the river flowing nearby and the birds calling to each other but otherwise there seemed to be no one about.
""Remember, there is no turning back once we enter the temple,"" continued Lord Vellorin. ""There is no way out of here save through me and I am not going to let any of you leave. If you choose to remain outside the temple then I will do everything in my power to stop you but you must know that your chances of survival are minimal. If you are still determined to stay, then please step forward and wait here."" He smiled briefly before stepping further inside. ""Good luck gentlemen.""
A moment later the door shut and there was silence.
""Let us see how brave they really are,"" said Lord Vellorin softly.
He stepped into the entranceway and began walking slowly deeper into the building, his hand resting lightly upon the hilt of his sword as he did so.
""Come on then,"" called Lord Vellorin loudly. ""What are you waiting for? Let us begin!""
His voice echoed eerily throughout the interior of the temple. His men followed him closely, keeping close together. None dared to turn their backs to the darkness that stretched out before them but none made any attempt to flee either. All waited quietly as they followed Lord Vellorin into the unknown.
As they moved deeper into the temple, they saw that the floor was covered in fine sand that sparkled like diamonds. The walls glowed brightly with an inner light that made it seem as though they were walking through a tunnel of purest gold. As they went farther inwards, the light dimmed somewhat but the feeling of warmth and serenity remained.
""You're right,"" whispered one of the men nervously. ""I don't feel afraid anymore. This feels good.""
Another man added, ""I think we should continue on.""
Lord Vellorin laughed softly. ""I'm glad to hear that! Come on, we haven't much time left.""
With that he started moving faster down the corridor, leading his men onward. Soon they came to a crossroads where four paths branched off. Each branch had its own unique colour and Lord Vellorin led them to the red one. At first he kept walking straight but after a short while he turned left and followed the passage. After another ten minutes or so he took a right turn and found himself following a narrow passage between two towering columns. The passage was lit by a glowing ball of white energy that hung suspended directly in front of them.
Lord Vellorin paused momentarily and glanced back at his men before speaking again. ""I hope you've all chosen wisely because there's no turning back from here.""
""What if we chose wrong?"" asked one of the men timidly.
Lord Vellorin shook his head. ""Then I'll take care of it myself but I doubt I'd survive doing it alone so I wouldn't worry too much about it."" He frowned thoughtfully. ""I suppose I could always go back for you but I don't want to waste my time on such trivial things.""
After a brief pause, he resumed his walk down the passageway. A little while later he heard footsteps echoing through the corridor behind him. When he looked over his shoulder, he saw his men standing motionless. He couldn't tell exactly how many of them there were but there were certainly more than five.
""Well, well,"" said Lord Vellorin quietly. ""If it isn't the leader of this rabble. It's a shame I won't be able to kill all of you personally but I guess I can settle for killing you instead.""
The footsteps continued steadily towards him. He watched carefully but the figure never revealed itself.
""Why are you running away from me?"" shouted Lord Vellorin angrily. ""I didn't say anything insulting yet you still run. Do you know who I am? I am the most powerful wizard in all of the Kingdom. Even the High Priest has never seen my like.""
There were a few chuckles amongst his followers.
""Oh yes, that's quite true,"" agreed a woman. ""I've heard that story before. What a pity that it wasn't true.""
Lord Vellorin spun around quickly, his sword raised high above his head. ""Who spoke?!""
The woman smirked. ""I did. You should have listened when I warned you.""
Lord Vellorin lowered his sword and sheathed it. ""I'm sorry. That was uncalled for. You were right. My magic does not work here.""
""Of course it doesn't,"" replied the woman. ""I told you that you would find nothing here. You might as well give up now and try something else.""
""Give up?"" cried Lord Vellorin in shock. ""Do you realize who you're talking to? How dare you talk to me like this!""
Lord Vellorin felt his anger rising but he managed to hold it in check. He stared at the woman for several seconds and then turned to his men. ""I apologize for my outburst.",1234,-0.527497266335693,-0.04451624958591089,-1.0659044986950916,-1.2557871503042903,-0.13947476913478243
222,R_zdwsAjpaziUSi3v,OUR_HSF_8,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The air was warm and clear, and I breathed deeply of it as I walked back to my car.
There was no reason to be late today, since there would only be a handful of people present when the president delivered his message. As far as I knew, he wasn't planning to fire me yet, but I still didn't want to take any chances. I quickly drove across the city to reach the presidential complex and parked at the underground garage. There were three elevators in the center of the huge building, and I took the one on the left that led directly up to the top floor. I checked my watch—2:30 pm—then followed the sign for President Wu's office. A few minutes later I stepped into a large room full of cubicles. A single woman sat behind a desk, looking up at me as I entered.
""Dr. Sato gave you the message, right?"" she said.
I nodded.
""Let me get your ID card,"" she said, reaching for the badge clip hanging around my neck. I handed it over, and she swiped it through the computer mounted on her desk. The light above the desk turned green, and the woman smiled.
""You're in luck,"" she said. ""The president's actually here right now. Do you mind coming with me? We'd like to see you before we send the message down to the lab.""
It took only a few seconds to find my way out of the room and through another security checkpoint before walking into a conference room where the president, Dr. Sato, and four others were already waiting for me. As soon as the door shut behind us, Dr. Wu stood up and walked across the room towards me. I rose to stand at attention, and waited while he reached out his hand to shake mine.
""Doctor, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. And thank you for taking the time to come all the way up here from Mars,"" the president said, squeezing my hand once before letting go. The meeting room was so large, I had a clear view of everyone sitting around the table. They were all well dressed and looked relaxed—at least as much as any group of people can be when there are armed soldiers standing just outside the door. I recognized two of them—Sergeant Carrington and Private Jacobson—who were part of the president's security team. The rest of the people in the room I didn't know. A young man and a woman sat on either side of President Wu; both appeared to be his aides or assistants.
""Thank you for seeing me,"" I said, bowing my head slightly as I spoke. ""I'm very glad to see that our cooperation is continuing, and that we're still able to meet on such an informal basis.""
Dr. Sato leaned forward slightly. ""I also appreciate the fact that you came all the way up here,"" she said. ""It shows real initiative, and speaks well of your work ethic.""
""Of course,"" I replied. ""This is my home, after all. And I have no wish to offend my friends and colleagues here by being late.""
The president smiled at me, and I knew then that I had made the correct choice to accept his job offer. He was a warm and friendly man who was very open to ideas. It took only a few seconds for him to confirm that I could work out a long-term contract with him that would guarantee my salary, plus a bonus, plus my share of the research fund.
""Good,"" he said. ""I was hoping that you'd say that. In fact, we're actually going to be giving you a raise.""
""Really?"" I said. ""Are you sure? It's already twice what I earned at the lab.""
""Of course. I want you to be happy working for me, and I know that your loyalty to the mission will never waver. You can take the money and run if you want. We won't be able to stop you, since it would mean war, but the offer will always be available for you if you ever change your mind.""
""I think not,"" I replied. ""Your offer is most generous, and I thank you for your faith in my abilities.""
""Now I do have one question,"" said Dr. Sato, leaning forward to address the president. ""You know how much we value your expertise, and you know how important this project is to all of us. Why are you so anxious to get the researchers in Mars off the island? I mean, you've given us plenty of warning that you were coming, but you're still taking them all away.""
""I don't like to talk about politics,"" said President Wu. ""It's not my job. But I think I can answer your question. You'll understand why when I show you something. Come with me, please."" He stood up and motioned towards the door. Carrington and Jacobson moved to stand behind him as he walked past. The three of them formed a line in front of the president, and I followed after him. We turned the corner at the end of the long room, then stepped into a large conference room just down the hall. I saw an even larger room with a set of double doors opposite the door we had come through. I'd seen this before, but it was always locked and rarely used. As we approached the doors, the president knocked on them lightly, and they slowly opened. We entered the room, where President Wu pushed the red button under his desk. It took a moment for the door to close behind us. When it finally did, I could hear the hum of an air conditioner above our heads.
""The main air conditioning system on the island isn't working,"" said the president, turning towards the control panel built into one wall. ""This room gets very hot during the day. So when I want to give someone a surprise, this is the only way I can do it. Would you mind if we closed the door?""
He waited for a response, then hit the button again and turned to me. ""Dr. Sato gave you my message about the meeting with the president, right?"" he asked. ""Well, what she didn't tell you was that we also have an appointment with the Council.""
I nodded, and he smiled. ""We need to speak to the council before we take any action. We're still waiting for their reply."" He turned back towards the control panel. ""The room isn't sealed—not completely. I'm sure we'll be allowed to leave before long, but I can't risk anyone finding out about this. If they knew, all of us would lose our jobs. Do you understand?""
""I think so,"" I said. ""Why do you need the meeting with the council?""
President Wu chuckled at the look on my face. ""Because they own us,"" he said. ""They pay our salaries and keep us employed, even though most of us are only doing menial tasks that aren't useful to anyone.",1239,0.09835103417436539,-1.020901383157914,-2.231861983519008,0.12188001214769338,-0.6810109324803874
223,R_ymCfPbFpNF1z877,LOW_HOR_6,Horror,Low Rider,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had an old man's face with wrinkles all around its eyes, which were covered by long, thin eyebrows. It also had a big nose that stuck out from underneath its chin.
""You're awake,"" the man said in a deep voice. ""My name is William. My daughter and I found you last night.""
The man had been sitting down when he spoke to me but now stood up. He held his hand out for me to shake. His fingers were very thick, like tree roots wrapped around a large boulder.
""It's nice to meet you,"" I said as I shook his hand. ""What happened last night?""
William took a few steps closer to me and reached his hand through the mirror. ""You were attacked by vampires after coming out of the forest. We found you near death. You're lucky we were able to find you before they did.""
I put my hand through the mirror and felt myself getting smaller inside it. Once I had gone through, I saw that I wasn't alone. There were many other people standing around me, staring at me in awe. All of them looked just like William or his daughter, Elizabeth. They were all tall like him, with their long white hair tied back with black ribbons. They also had long noses and wrinkled faces, just like him.
""You must be tired,"" William said as he led me away from everyone else. ""Follow me and we'll get you something to eat. The food here is very good.""
I followed William to a table where two others already sat waiting for us. As we sat down, the man beside me introduced himself.
""I'm James,"" he said. ""Are you okay? You look terrible. You're pale and your lips are blue.""
I nodded. ""How am I feeling?"" I asked.
""You're weak, but you should recover soon.""
We ate our meal silently while James stared at me. After finishing off everything on my plate, I thanked everyone and left the dining room. When I went upstairs to my bedroom, there was another person standing in front of it. She was dressed in black pants and a red sweater. Her dark brown hair was pulled back into a ponytail.
""Elizabeth,"" William called to her as she stepped inside. ""This is Mary.""
Mary smiled at me. ""Hello, Mary.""
She didn't introduce herself to me so I figured that meant she knew who I was. We started talking about what happened to me. It turned out that we weren't the only ones here. There were several other young women living in the house too. One of them was pregnant and expecting a baby boy.
As I talked with Mary, William came up behind us and placed his hands on our shoulders.
""I want you both to meet someone,"" William said. ""This is my granddaughter, Alice.""
Alice smiled at us and walked over to the mirror. After stepping inside, I felt myself getting bigger and noticed the others shrinking around me. Alice had a very pretty face and a slender figure. Her black hair fell to her waist and was tied back with a white ribbon. When she stepped through, it made her appear much taller than I was.
William grabbed her shoulder and pulled her back out again. ""You have to stay out of mirrors,"" he told her sternly.
""Yes, grandpa. Sorry,"" Alice replied. ""I couldn't resist.""
After she left, I looked back at my reflection in the mirror and felt myself shrinking until I was the same height as Mary. ""Who are you?"" I asked her.
Mary looked surprised for a moment then laughed. ""You don't know? I'm Mary! You've seen me many times before, I bet.""
I stared at her. ""How do you know?""
Mary giggled and shook her head. ""Let's go sit down. We can talk more later.""
We went downstairs together and sat at another table. Mary told me that she was sixteen years old and that she lived here for a year before Elizabeth showed up.
""I wanted to run away from home. My parents don't really care about me anymore so it would be nice to live somewhere else.""
I looked up at Mary as she spoke. ""Why do you say they don't care?""
She shrugged. ""My mother has remarried recently. She's not interested in taking care of me anymore.""
I looked down at the table and frowned. I was glad to hear that Mary had a father who cared for her. I could tell she missed him by the sadness in her voice.
After lunch, William suggested I take a nap since I was still weak. I agreed because I felt completely exhausted. I fell asleep almost immediately once I lay down on my bed. While I slept, I dreamed about being chased by a dark shadow in a field. It was following me everywhere I went. Each time I tried to run away from it, it was always right behind me. It seemed to be laughing at me every time I tried to escape.
When I woke up, it was afternoon. I went downstairs and joined Mary and Elizabeth at the table again.
""Have you seen Mary yet?"" I asked Elizabeth.
Elizabeth shook her head. ""No, why? Is something wrong?""
""Just wondering.""
As I sat down next to Elizabeth, William walked into the dining room with Alice at his side. When they walked through the mirror, they appeared much smaller. ""Welcome to our family,"" William said to Alice. ""You seem very familiar to me.""
""That's because I've met you before,"" Alice said.
I gasped and stood up. ""You mean I have too? What are you doing here?""
""It's nice to meet you, Mary."" Alice said and shook my hand.
""Mary!"" I exclaimed and grabbed Mary's hand. ""Do you remember me?""
She looked surprised for a moment. ""Of course I do,"" she replied. ""I haven't forgotten about you after all this time.""
""What are you talking about?"" I asked.
""I've been watching you from afar these past couple months.""
I looked at Alice with wide eyes. ""Really?""
""Yes, you're one of my favorite people to watch.""
Everyone started looking at me funny and I realized that I must have looked insane. ""Wait a minute! Don't all of you remember me?""
Mary shook her head no and kept shaking it the whole time.
I looked at William and then Alice. Both of them were smiling at me, waiting for me to answer my own question.",1129,0.7870304444496847,0.7494064703228408,0.5061030633426217,-0.9866203856684183,0.7095806194625698

225,R_b4sQrtSuoeRrsGt,FAN_HR_2,Historical Romance,Fandango,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. His eyes met hers and he knew—this was the woman who would be his wife. The girl's mother had been a friend of the family but the father had wanted her to marry a man his own age. They couldn't keep him away though. He didn't want to leave the village where he grew up, but she wasn't giving him any choice.
She had been beautiful and her voice sweetly melodious. He hadn't known what to say; it was as if she lit a fire in his soul. And when they were finally wed, he was glad. In many ways he felt that his life was blessed because he had married the girl he had met at the tavern when he was barely seventeen. He didn't remember what his name had been back then.
His daughter grew up with him being the dutiful husband and he tried to love her as much as he could. But he never stopped yearning for her mother. For years he did nothing to stop himself from thinking about her, imagining what kind of life she might have led, what she looked like, how she smelled when she was around him.
He would try to focus on his daughter but all he could think about was how he wished he could be alone with her so they could talk or go on walks together. There was never enough time to do any of that. He always found excuses as to why they couldn't, especially when she was still very young. After she grew up, he would find reasons as to why it wouldn't work out, but still he longed for more than anything else to be with her.
There were times when he even thought his wife didn't care for him anymore because she had said nothing about wanting to move to the city where he was stationed. She would always tell him that it wasn't possible because he had no money. When she said things like that, it almost felt as if his whole world came crashing down on him. He had to remind himself that he had a lot of other responsibilities and couldn't just get up and go wherever he wanted whenever he wanted.
It wasn't long before his mind drifted to thoughts about another woman and he couldn't help but wonder if his wife knew what was going through his head. That was something he would never bring up because that would mean admitting that he might not be completely devoted to her.
And as time went by, he started thinking that maybe things would be better if he took his daughter and left. She would be raised in a good home and would still get to know her mother. She would grow up knowing that there was an alternative to staying here, in this small village, where they knew no one.
He kept those thoughts to himself and was careful about what he said around his daughter, but he couldn't help but wonder if she might be able to tell that something was wrong. It had taken a while for them to adjust after he brought her to this village. Maybe she thought he was getting tired of raising her?
After being a soldier for so many years, the war had ended and he was now working as a farmer. As much as he hated doing such hard physical labor, he knew he needed to earn money to send back home since he would be supporting both himself and his daughter. And when the woman he had loved so much walked through the door of the tavern where he worked and smiled at him, he knew she was the only thing he wanted in life.
He had thought she was gone from his life forever. Even if he had stayed and tried to get her back, he had no idea how he would have done that or where to begin. Now that he had seen her again, he couldn't imagine himself settling for anyone but her.
His wife didn't seem to notice his gaze as she talked to another woman, but she soon turned around. Her eyes fixed on the girl who was watching the two of them from a distance. He had been right about that; she had remembered that he was still alive. He was glad. Maybe things wouldn't end up being as bad as he thought they could. She had asked him to come and meet her in the city so she could tell him more about herself and where she lived. He was tempted to refuse, and he was sure she knew that, but he thought they should at least try to talk some more. He might have regretted seeing her again if she'd never given him any chance to clear his doubts.
The look of shock on her face when he got up and walked over to where she stood had been priceless. He couldn't believe she didn't recognize him right away. He wasn't surprised though when she looked away and began to talk to the person with her. His mind told him he shouldn't push things further but his heart told him otherwise. He wanted to spend time talking to her and he wanted to hold her. And after having missed out on all those years, he realized that he didn't care what anyone else thought. If he hadn't gotten up and left her all those years ago, he probably wouldn't have been in the tavern that day. He might have never seen her again.
It had taken him a while to figure out how to go about contacting her, but he eventually managed to find out where she had settled. He had gone there and waited for her outside their house, but she didn't show up. Not everyone had believed what he had said, but some had listened. There was something about the way he had come back with his daughter that made people think he was serious about what he had told them. He was relieved that they believed in him.
For years he had thought about trying to get another woman to stay with him, but when his daughter was born, he became more attached to her than he could ever imagine. That was the reason he had told his wife that he needed to get away from them for a while and go to the city where he had met her. At first he had thought she was mad at him, but soon she started to understand what he was trying to do. She was actually glad that he was finally thinking of moving. But as the weeks went by and he didn't come back, she realized that he might never return.
He wasn't sure what happened next, but soon word spread that someone had seen him with a woman in the city. It wasn't long until he was accused of being unfaithful and thrown out of his home. He had no choice but to go back to the village where he had once lived because no one in the city would give him a job.
He thought that if he worked on the farms and in the taverns he would be able to earn enough money to take care of himself and his daughter. But it was impossible. He hadn't even thought about how much it cost to raise children back when he was away fighting for the king. It wasn't that he didn't care for his daughter, he just couldn't afford to give her the life that she deserved.
He was in debt and didn't have enough to make ends meet. But no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't find a job that would pay him enough money to do so. He had to accept whatever work came his way in order to put food on the table for his daughter. He did what he had to do so that he could survive, but deep inside he knew he wasn't happy. The only thing that kept him going was seeing his daughter every day.
One night he finally had enough.",1399,0.8811984768348173,0.6960936202665337,1.1040678293433075,-0.8715804683710678,1.6536329880901932
226,R_301ToDYVqWB6dqh,FAN_HOR_1,Horror,Fandango,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a man that I didn't know. He opened his mouth to speak and I saw his teeth were sharp like a shark.
Then, I realized it was a reflection in a mirror with no one behind it. The reflection continued, ""You have come here for me.""
I tried to scream but nothing would come out. I tried to push the man out of the mirror but he wouldn't go. I ran to my room and grabbed a pair of scissors off my dresser. I took them back to the mirror and stabbed him as hard as I could. Nothing happened. The man smiled and said, ""No matter how deeply you try to hurt me, all that will end up is blood on your hands.""
I threw the scissors at him and they bounced right off his head. He reached out to grab my arm and I pulled it away. Then I hit him in the chest with the scissors and it had no effect either. ""Don't you know that I'm dead already?"" he asked. ""Why else would you be in my realm? But why are you here?""
""I...I came here for answers,"" I said.
He laughed and said, ""What do you think you'll find? That I was killed by a monster?""
""I don't know who you are, or what you want, but you're not going to get it from me,"" I said.
""You don't know anything,"" he said, ""because you can't see what's coming. You can't stop it and, now, you don't even know where you've been sent to.""
That's when I heard a loud thud in the living room. I rushed out there to see my mother lying on the ground. Her eyes were open and she wasn't moving. I looked in the other rooms and found the same thing, each person laid out on the floor with their eyes wide open and motionless.
The man spoke again, ""It's time to die, little girl. Now you understand why I came.""
He pulled a knife out of nowhere, jumped at me and tried to slit my throat. I dodged and cut his arm and then his leg. He turned around and began running to the door. I followed him into the hallway and tripped him as we went down the stairs. He fell backwards and his head hit the wall. Before he could stand up again, I held my hand out to the knife and pushed it through my arm.
When I woke up, I was still holding the knife and blood was coming out of my arm. I was so weak and exhausted that I fell asleep again. When I woke up next, I didn't know where I was. I realized I was in my car, parked in front of my house. There were footprints all around the vehicle and on the hood as well. They were too large and deep to belong to anything but a human being.
I went inside and checked on my mother. I saw that she had been sitting up and was awake. She told me the same man had come into her room and told her it was time to die. He said she had no family left and there was nothing to live for anymore. He told her he would kill us both but first she needed to give me an answer. He gave her a choice: either I would die and he would leave our lives alone, or she would be killed and he would take us both. He had given her the same choice a few times before.
She had chosen to say goodbye to me and had died peacefully while I sat crying in the corner of the room. When my father heard what happened, he called the police to report the murder.
The next day, the police searched the house and found the killer. He had escaped through a window on the second floor.
Since then, I've seen the man in all different places. We've been all over town and even out of state. He shows up whenever I need him and tries to help me but he always gives up and disappears.
This is part of what is known as the ""Hitchhiker's Game."" He comes to people in trouble and asks them for a place to stay. The hitchhiker stays with them until they need another place to go. He doesn't care about the way they look or who they are. All he wants is a safe place to sleep. The hitchhiker will show up in the middle of a war zone or in a house without food for a week, even if all the people in the house have died.
He never says anything to those he picks up. If someone asks him who he is or where he came from, he becomes enraged. He tries to stab them through the chest, but if they dodge the knife, he runs away.
People who have encountered the hitchhiker believe he's the angel of death; some think he is Lucifer, and others that he is the devil himself. Some say his real name is ""Caleb,"" but no one knows what his true intentions are.
There has only been one documented attempt to kill the hitchhiker. It was in France during World War II. A group of Allied soldiers saw him and recognized him as the angel of death. While attempting to get him to talk, the soldiers threw grenades at him. One of the grenades exploded close to him and killed him instantly.
In my case, I still haven't figured out the hitchhiker's game. I haven't figured out why he keeps appearing and trying to help me when I don't even recognize him.
Maybe I will find out eventually. Maybe I won't. But until that time comes, I need to figure this whole thing out on my own.

227,R_339KttAqvLo2vLG,FAN_HSF_7,Hard Sci-Fi,Fandango,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
It felt like a good omen. Maybe it would be another good day.
I walked over to the parking lot near the university and parked my car. The walk back up the hill was short.
When I entered the building, one of the guards stopped me. ""Excuse me,"" he said. ""You can't go down there."" He pointed at the elevator. ""I think you've got the wrong floor.""
I smiled. ""That's fine,"" I said. ""I'm actually going up."" I took out my ID card and flashed it at him. ""Dr. Jameson is expecting me. Do you want to tell him I didn't show?""
The guard blinked. ""Well... yeah. That's kinda what I'm supposed to do if you don't have an appointment."" He looked at the ID. ""Is this a student ID?""
""It looks like it."" I shrugged. ""Sorry.""
""I mean, I know we usually aren't supposed to let them in without appointments but... um... well..."" He looked uncomfortable. ""But I guess you're okay,"" he finally told me.
There was no elevator here, so instead I started up the stairway, thinking I'd get some exercise since I hadn't had time for a jog yet today.
Maybe I could use this as my chance to take the stairs. After all, I knew they were just a precautionary measure because of the elevators being taken out of commission in case someone tried to hijack one. I couldn't blame them for worrying about something like that, but it meant that when you needed to go up or down a whole floor, the stairs were your only option.
Not a bad problem to have, really.
At least for people like me.
By the time I reached the top floor, I was breathing hard from the climb. When I entered Dr. Jameson's office, he was sitting at his desk, writing something. I smiled at him and took the chair in front of his desk. He looked up as I came in.
""Good afternoon, Jim,"" I said. ""I trust your morning went well?""
He smiled. ""It did. You know I always enjoy our talks.""
I grinned at him and opened the envelope. ""I've got some good news to share with you. According to the data I received this morning, we might actually start seeing some real progress with these prototypes.""
Jim leaned forward eagerly. ""Really? When exactly will we see results?""
I smiled. ""Well, I'll give you the specifics later, but... you may want to start preparing for some good news.""
He frowned. ""Why should I have to prepare for something I've been waiting a long time to hear?""
""Because, Jim... the president wants us to go public with everything by the end of the week. He feels that if we announce all of this publicly, it will motivate the rest of the world to help us solve the problems we're facing with the new technologies. He wants to make sure that everyone knows about our success.""
""And we should be happy with that?"" he asked.
I nodded. ""Yes, sir."" I pulled out the letter from the president and handed it to him. Then I sat back in my chair and crossed my legs. ""I also ran into some other interesting news.""
Jim unfolded it carefully.
As soon as he finished reading it, his eyes lit up and he jumped out of his seat. ""What? That's great!"" he exclaimed. ""So you're going public with everything by the end of the week?""
I nodded. ""Right now I'm putting together a press conference for Friday and we're going to start showing off the new tech at that point. We're just waiting for the final approval for all of this to come through, but I know it's going to happen sooner rather than later. I think the president has already approved the final designs, so we're just waiting for him to go public with it. We'll probably see all of this announced in the news by the end of the week.""
Jim stared at me, dumbstruck. ""Are you kidding me? All right! This is amazing!"" he shouted, then he jumped out of his chair and pumped both fists in the air. ""We're going to blow the doors off the competition! We're going to be the ones everyone else copies, and we'll have more money than we know what to do with.""
I laughed. ""Now that's what I call a win-win situation.""
""Exactly,"" he said, smiling. ""This is going to be fantastic!""
I laughed. ""Yeah. It will.""
But there was still something bothering me about all of this.
If the president wanted to go public with what we were doing, why was it a problem for him that he couldn't tell his own wife about it? He'd spent the last two years trying to hide it from her and had done a pretty damn good job of it so far.
I knew she would be angry if he told her now. The way he'd been acting toward her lately wasn't any secret, but if he went public about what we were actually doing, I was sure it wouldn't look good. Not to mention, she was likely to want to stop this research because of how much they'd already spent on it.
I glanced down at the letter again.
""So, uh... what was that letter you were reading?"" Jim asked.
I shook my head. ""Just some paperwork. Nothing important.""
He rolled his eyes. ""Okay, so let's focus on your presentation this Friday. What do we need to get ready?""
I shrugged. ""All I need is the final approval to proceed.""
Jim grinned. ""Well, I hope that happens. I'll talk to you later.""
I nodded. ""Great. See you then."" I stood up and walked over to the door. ""Oh, by the way,"" I said. ""I got a little surprise for you.""
""A surprise?""
""Yep. I've been working on it for a while.""
Jim raised a curious eyebrow. ""What kind of surprise?""
I gave him a crooked grin. ""It starts with an 'F' and ends with an 'O'. And it rhymes with 'giant.'""
He laughed, then shook his head at me. ""You know, Jim, I never thought I'd find myself wanting to kill someone less than I want to kill that bastard Dr. Mok.""
I smiled. ""Well, keep in mind that we'll probably end up killing him eventually. So I hope you've made yourself comfortable because the ride is getting longer. We're going to need you to stick around a bit longer.""",1139,0.049639737681153526,1.0808098136365105,0.13151341609400768,1.1937288932662447,1.202603254091851
228,R_3syIIhrkydioFmV,FAN_HOR_2,Horror,Fandango,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. As soon as my eyes adjusted to the dark, I realized it wasn't my reflection, but that of a young boy. The boy was wearing a green shirt with yellow stripes, jeans with blue stripes and shoes with red stripes, just like me. He had blond hair and freckles.
""Who are you?"" I asked. When the boy didn't respond, I said, ""Did you hear what I said?"" He nodded his head. I took one step closer to him until we were almost touching each other. I could see his face very well now. There was no doubt in my mind that he wasn't real.
""I can't believe this,"" I said. ""You're not part of my dream.""
The boy shook his head slightly. ""You're not real, are you?""
""I can't believe you came to me from a dream. Maybe I'm dreaming right now. Maybe I'm having some kind of brain attack or something.""
""It's okay, Alex."" The boy smiled at me and then began to cry. ""I didn't mean to do that. Why did I have to make such a mess for you to come in here and clean up? It's all my fault. I didn't mean to do it.""
He put his hands on my shoulders and started crying even harder. Tears flowed down his cheeks and dripped onto mine. His tears hit my lips and the taste of salt made me realize that I was awake, and that the boy was real.
My heart ached for him so I hugged him tightly. The more I held him, the more I felt like a bad guy myself. After we stood there holding each other for awhile, I whispered in his ear, ""How did you get inside my room?""
""I followed the trail of your footsteps.""
I was surprised at that. I didn't think that anyone could follow my footsteps through my house. I knew how to sneak around the house, but when I went home, if I ever left my shoes outside of the door, I would be sure they were cleaned off by the time I returned. The same thing applied to the hallway floors in our house.
""What trail? Do you mean footprints?""
""No. That is, yes. I mean that too, but I also meant how I followed you around.""
""Why didn't you follow my steps?""
""I couldn't. The air conditioner was on in this room. I couldn't breathe.""
""Oh,"" I said. ""Why were you following me?""
""Because I wanted to talk to you.""
""To what? What about?""
""About all the dreams you've been having lately.""
I told him about the nightmares I'd been having since the accident. He listened intently as I spoke, nodding his head along with my words.
When I finished, he said, ""If you don't want to talk, that's okay. I can go back to my mommy now.""
""Wait,"" I said. ""You know about the dreams?""
""Of course I do. I can read you like an open book,"" the boy said with a smile.
""Then you must know about the other dream I've been having.""
""Sure I do.""
""Do you remember it?""
""It's the memory of your childhood. You're trying to remember who you were before the accident.""
""Yes, that's it exactly.""
""Don't worry. We'll fix it together.""
I was amazed that he was so smart. ""You really are smart, aren't you?""
He laughed out loud. ""You don't need to tell me that. I am!""
""Okay,"" I said. ""Let's go fix your mother's memory.""
""Okay,"" he replied, and took my hand. ""Follow me.""
We walked out into the hall, and then through the living room to the front door. I stopped halfway to the door and looked back. The boy sat on the floor where he was when I first saw him. I turned back to face the front door and started to walk outside. But then I stopped again.
""Where are you going?""
""What are you talking about? We're going outside,"" I answered.
""No! Don't leave me!""
I turned to look at him and realized he was crying harder than before. I walked over to him and knelt down on the floor next to him.
""Look. I'm sorry about earlier. You're going to be fine.""
He looked up at me through tear-filled eyes, and nodded. I reached out and patted him on the head.
""Come on. Let's go fix your mother.""
We both got up and walked back toward the door. Before I opened it, I heard the boy say, ""Thank you, Alex.""
I smiled and opened the door. I stepped outside, closed the door behind me, and started walking toward my parents' house. The boy followed me. I was about to ask him how he knew where my house was, when I noticed that he wasn't walking with me anymore. I scanned the area around us, but didn't see any trace of him. I turned to look at the spot he was standing in when I first saw him and could see nothing.
""Hey! Where are you?""
I turned around to see a man coming toward me. He had a large backpack strapped over his shoulder. When we got close enough for a good look, I remembered this man. It was Dr. Larkin.
""Alex,"" he said with his signature southern drawl, ""You okay?""
I was taken aback by how much he resembled the man in my childhood memories.
""Dr. Larkin, what are you doing here?""
""I'm here to see your parents.""
""But—""
""You're not going to hurt them, are you?"" he asked.
""I wouldn't do that. Why would I?""
""I don't know. Maybe because of the way you've been acting lately.""
""I have not been acting strangely.""
""You seem angry sometimes, then you're nice. One moment, you're sad and crying; the next, you're smiling like crazy.""
""That's because I'm remembering things from my childhood.""
""Are you still dreaming about the accident?""
I thought for a second and answered, ""Yes.""
""You know, Alex, I know something happened to you on that day. Something that affected the rest of your life.",1056,0.5462882603277,0.6067995335366018,0.618694344297762,-0.11605956324236048,-0.5523002763412954
229,R_QlA16KLc2PQpVsJ,ALL_HF_9,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Are you sure this is where we're supposed to meet them?"" asked Lothar as he and the others dismounted and tied off their horses. ""It looks completely abandoned.""
""I'm not certain,"" said Dorn. He had ridden ahead to scout the area. ""But I did see something moving on the tower roof before we rode here. There might still be someone there.""
Dorn had a good point. Even if there wasn't, they were close enough to the mountains that they could set up an ambush if necessary. They had to assume there were enemies waiting for them somewhere nearby.
""All right, let's get moving then,"" said Lothar. ""We don't have any choice. If we want to save the princess, this is our only chance. Let's go.""
Lothar led the way, followed by his friends and their mounts, toward the tower. As they approached it, a large shape suddenly rose up out of the shadows. Before anyone could react, the creature leaped down from the tower, landing in front of them.
""Who are you and what do you want?"" demanded the creature, its voice deep and gruff.
The group stood frozen, not sure how to respond.
""My name is Lothar,"" said Lothar, slowly approaching the creature. ""And we came to find out what happened to the people in the village. We've been looking all over for them.""
The creature looked at Lothar for several moments, studying him carefully. Then it turned to the others, its face expressionless.
""You know, you're right. I was just about to leave when I saw someone on the tower. So, if you'll follow me, I'll take you to her.""
Dorn, who had been staring at the creature, finally noticed it. He stepped forward to get a better look.
""What is that thing?"" he asked, pointing to the creature's arm. It was covered with a thick coat of black fur and appeared to be growing out of its wrist.
The creature's eyes narrowed slightly as it stared down Dorn. ""That is my arm, human. You see, I am a kobold. The people you seek are not here.""
Dorn frowned at the creature but said nothing more. Instead, he turned back to Lothar.
""It sounds like we can't trust this one,"" he said, motioning to the creature with his head. ""I'm going to go see if there are any other kobolds around.""
Lothar nodded in agreement and watched as Dorn left.
""We should stay together,"" he told the rest of the group. ""Let's make sure no one gets separated.""
The others nodded their assent, and they continued walking toward the village. They soon reached a small house that sat along the side of the valley. The door was open, and from inside they could hear the sound of sobbing.
""That must be her,"" said Lothar, pointing to the house.
""I agree,"" said Dorn, moving up to stand next to Lothar. ""Let's go.""
The group followed Dorn into the house and found themselves in a large kitchen. A young girl, barely older than six, was sitting on a stool by the counter, sobbing uncontrollably. Her father, an old man with a long grey beard, stood at the stove, stirring something in a pot over a fire. The smell of stew wafted through the room.
""Please, stop crying,"" said Dorn as he moved to the girl's side. ""Your mother will be here soon.""
The girl sniffled for several moments before turning to him, her face streaked with tears and snot. She looked up at Dorn, her eyes wide and scared.
""My mother?"" she asked, wiping the tears from her cheeks. ""What do you mean? My mother is gone. She died when I was little.""
Dorn sighed heavily, his heart breaking at the thought of what the child must be feeling. ""I'm sorry to hear that, little one,"" he said as kindly as possible. ""But your mother will be coming home soon. I promise you that.""
The girl sniffled again, her eyes growing wide. ""You're not going to eat my mother, are you?""
Dorn's face turned red as he realized how it sounded. ""No! Of course not,"" he said, quickly adding, ""I meant no harm by it.""
The girl sniffled some more and wiped the tears from her cheeks. ""Then who are you?"" she asked.
Dorn smiled at her. ""That's what I want to ask you.""
The girl looked at Dorn with uncertainty. ""Well, I am a kobold.""
""I see,"" said Dorn. ""And where did you come from?""
""From a village called Ryliss,"" replied the kobold, its voice low and gruff. ""It was attacked by humans. They killed everyone in our village. But then the kobolds came. We fought them off and took their village.""
Dorn's jaw dropped open. ""How many people were there in this village?""
The girl nodded. ""About fifty or sixty.""
Dorn looked over at Lothar. The ranger shrugged his shoulders. He had been wondering the same thing. If the village was that small, it couldn't have taken out so many humans without help from the other kobold clans.
""Where is Ryliss?"" asked Dorn, trying to sound calm.
The kobold shook its head. ""It doesn't matter right now. We need to find your mother, and we can talk about it later.""
Dorn frowned but didn't say anything further. Instead, he turned to the old man stirring the stew. ""What happened here?""
The old man stopped and turned to look at Dorn, a slight smile on his face. ""Nothing,"" he said, shaking his head. ""We've just been waiting for someone to come by so that we could get out of this place.""
""Who are you?"" asked Dorn.
The old man smiled. ""I'm Lothar, and this is my friend Dorn. We're here to help you find your mother.""
""My mother? I don't think she's coming back,"" said the girl, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. ""She left me behind. She's gone.""
Dorn looked over at Lothar again. This wasn't going as planned. He couldn't see how they were ever going to rescue the princess if these kobolds weren't willing to help.",1087,-1.1490926807633608,0.8958053308149911,-0.20061907111985874,-0.5792614797067326,-1.702320187408004

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. And it was summer: the hottest season, and the busiest time for the colony.
My stomach growled as I headed to the nearest food cart. As I ordered the sandwich, I looked at the letter in my hand. It was short and to the point:
Dr. Dominguez,
I would like to discuss with you some information concerning a newly discovered mineral deposit that could be beneficial to your company and the colony. I have attached a copy of the data that we have so far.
I look forward to our meeting.
Sincerely,
J.C.
President
I finished my lunch quickly and walked back to my apartment. The president was in his office when I got there, looking at a data tablet. ""Doctor,"" he said, ""I hope you're hungry.""
""Not really,"" I said, sitting in one of the chairs in front of his desk. ""I ate lunch just now."" He glanced at me and I saw a small smile on his face. ""What's so funny?""
""I was just thinking that if you're not hungry, then maybe you'll be willing to join me for an early dinner?"" I nodded and stood. ""The address is printed on the bottom of this letter you have.""
""I'll be ready in fifteen minutes,"" I said, still smiling as I walked out of his office.
The dining car of the station was just a large open room with four long tables on both sides of it, all of them full of people from the local community. I walked up to a young man who was sitting at the end of one of them and asked for a table for two. He led me to one at the very end of the room where there were only two other people sitting at it—a man and a woman. As soon as I sat down, the man stood and walked over to my table. ""May I join you?"" he asked, holding out his hand and smiling at me.
""Of course,"" I said, returning his smile as we shook hands. ""My name is Josef Dominguez."" He introduced himself and sat down at the table with me as we both looked around at the other people eating their food. ""So,"" he said after a moment, ""do you enjoy dining with strangers?"" I laughed as another person sat down next to us at our table, asking if she could join us. It was a young woman with dark hair and blue eyes that reminded me of my wife back home on Earth. She smiled at me and shook my hand as well as Josef's before sitting down between us. ""Oh good,"" she said, looking at Josef, ""you're not alone tonight.""
""So what brings you to Mars?"" Josef asked her as he reached for some of her fries that she had left on her plate after she had finished eating her burger. ""Just arrived?"" she asked as she pulled her plate away from him. ""Yes,"" I said as I took one of them from him, ""we recently signed a contract with the colony to provide some new mining equipment for them.""
""Oh,"" she said, smiling at me, ""I'm Jennifer. I'm one of their miners."" She motioned to her plate and I looked down at it to see what it was that she had been eating—it was a steak with mashed potatoes and gravy on top of it. ""You like meat?"" she asked me. ""Yes,"" I replied as I reached for one of the fries that she had left on her plate as well, ""I just don't get any here very often.""
""I've never been to Earth myself,"" she said as she reached for a fry from my plate as well, ""but my dad has been talking about it a lot lately."" Josef and I nodded in agreement to that. He was from Argentina; she was from Germany. And we were all on Mars because we had contracts with the colony here—and none of us would have been here if it weren't for them.
I looked up from my plate to see that everyone else in our little group had finished eating—and most everyone else in the room had finished eating as well—and we were all just looking at each other awkwardly now that there were no more leftovers for us to try to finish off... or trade for something else that someone had left behind accidentally. Jennifer looked up at me and smiled again as Josef stood up... and then reached out a hand toward me in invitation to join him. ""We're going to see a movie,"" he said as Jennifer shook her head no, still looking back at me... and then looked away again after a moment. She must have seen something there that told her that whatever this was between us wasn't going to go anywhere anyway, because she finally smiled again—but only briefly—and shook her head no again before standing up and walking away from our table... leaving Josef and me alone together.
""Your dinner's getting cold!"" Jennifer shouted back to us from across the room before she walked off toward another part of the station. Josef chuckled as he stood up and walked over to where I was sitting. We both looked down at our plates—Josef's had been left untouched beside my plate—and then back up to each other again as he sat down across from me again, resting his elbows on the table and running his hands through his short hair again before meeting my eyes once more. ""So,"" he said after a moment, placing his hands in his lap once more, ""you want to go see a movie?""
""Yeah,"" I replied after a moment's pause... and then smiled as well, ""yeah, I'd like that."" He smiled back at me, reaching out his hand again this time, taking mine in his own before looking back up at me again... and taking my other hand in his own as well, turning it over so that he could look at my wedding ring before looking back up into my eyes once more. ""So what do you like to see?"" he asked me after a moment's pause, leaning forward slightly so that we could both look into each other's eyes once more before he leaned back again into his chair again.
""Oh,"" I laughed as I thought back over everything that my wife had tried to get me to watch on Earth... which was almost everything when she was trying to get me interested in something new... almost everything except for anything that had anything remotely close to romance in it! She'd actually made me watch several movies over time about aliens and time travel while trying to convince me that it would be fine if we ever got married so long as we didn't get divorced! She knew almost all of what they were about ahead of time though—she'd read all about them before she tried to get me interested in them!
Josef must have seen something on my face that told him that my wife had never made me watch anything like that because he laughed a little too loudly himself before shaking his head again and leaning back into his chair once more... his hands resting once more in his lap this time while he looked back up into my eyes seriously now...",1285,-0.8651071723552425,-0.15583654413836012,-0.7355417622364672,-1.191348916263117,0.448984180489112
231,R_2Sc8qIpHAwEWRjt,BAS_HOR_2,Horror,Basic Coherence,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a woman's face but with horns growing from her head. She had long black hair that went down to her waist and dark eyes. Her lips were full and she had a small nose. There was no color to her skin or any other distinguishing features except for the horns. They stood straight up above her forehead like an animal's would. As soon as I saw them, they started moving and grew longer and larger. The more they grew, the less human they became. I backed away from the mirror in fear when I felt something grab my ankle. I fell backwards onto the floor and screamed. My husband came running over to see what happened. He picked me up off the ground and asked if I was okay. I told him that someone grabbed my leg and tried to pull me under the water. He ran to get some help while I sat on the edge of our tub.
The next day we moved to another house. We didn't tell anyone about the incident because we both knew people would think we were crazy. That night I woke up screaming. I couldn't move and all I could do was watch myself sleep. I watched myself turn into a demon before my very eyes. I turned into a monster. I watched my body grow long arms and legs. Then I watched as my hands grew claws and sharp teeth appeared in my mouth. I looked at my husband sleeping beside me and smiled. I wanted to kill him so bad. I wanted to rip his heart out and eat it. But then I remembered how he saved me last time. I stopped smiling and began to cry. I cried until I passed out. The next morning I woke up and saw that I was still alive. I was relieved because I thought I killed myself in my dream. I went downstairs and found my husband sitting at the kitchen table. He told me that he saw me standing behind him in the kitchen. He said that I looked like a demon and he couldn't look at me without being afraid. I apologized for scaring him. After breakfast, I took a shower. While I was washing my hair, I noticed blood coming from underneath the sink. I opened the cabinet door and pulled out a knife. I cut my arm open and let the blood drip down the drain. I put the knife back where I found it and washed my wound. I cleaned the bathroom and made sure everything was in order before I went back to bed. I slept peacefully that night and didn't have any dreams. I figured that maybe I was just going crazy and needed to go see a doctor.
When I woke up the next morning, I went to take a shower and saw that the blood was gone. I was confused because I never used the bathroom sink to wash my wounds. I decided to clean it anyway and make sure nothing was wrong. I wiped down the sink and realized that there wasn't any blood on the towel. I was shocked because I had seen it with my own eyes. I called my husband and told him about it. He told me not to worry because it must be a coincidence. He said that he doesn't believe in anything supernatural and that I'm probably just imagining things. He said that I need to relax and stop worrying.
Later that night, I went to use the bathroom and saw that the blood was back. This time I didn't clean it off. I left it there and went to bed. The next morning, the blood was gone again. I was starting to get worried. I decided to call my mom and ask her if she had ever heard of this happening before. She told me that she has heard stories of people seeing demons in mirrors but she never believed them. She said that if you want to know what's real, you should try asking your grandmother. I thanked her and hung up. I got online and searched for information on demons in mirrors. I read all kinds of different articles. Some said that if you stare into a mirror long enough, you will become one. Others said that if you look into a mirror and don't blink, you'll die. One article even said that if you look into a mirror and smile, you'll have good luck. I laughed at that one. I decided to test it out and stared at the mirror for several minutes. Nothing happened. I blinked and went on with my life.
A few days later, I was taking a bath when I heard the sound of scratching on the wall. When I looked, there was a face staring back at me. It was a man's face but with horns growing from his head. His eyes were yellow and his mouth was filled with sharp teeth. I screamed and jumped out of the tub. My husband came running over to see what happened. He picked me up off the ground and asked if I was okay. I told him that someone was trying to scare me. He laughed and said that I was imagining things. He told me that I was too old to be scared by silly things like that. He said that I needed to get over it and stop acting like a child. He went back to watching TV and I went to bed.

232,R_XLLZCCfiSWWlwjv,ACE_HSF_6,Hard Sci-Fi,Ace of Spade,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I headed towards the center of town where most government buildings were located. The streets were quiet and empty as I made my way through the city. When I finally reached the presidential building I was surprised to see so few people around. Normally there would be throngs of tourists and journalists trying to get a glimpse of their new president. But today there was no one outside. Just as well; if they had been there then they would all know about the letter from the president.
Inside the lobby was also deserted except for a secretary who gave me directions to the president's office. As I walked up the stairs I could feel my heart beating faster. This was really happening! I wasn't sure how the president was going to react to the news that I'd found another alien race but I knew he wanted to talk to me about it. If he didn't want to hear anything more about the aliens then I couldn't do anything about that. So long as he wanted to speak to me I was willing to give him what information I had. That was all I could do anyway.
When I stepped into the president's office he stood up and came over to shake hands. He was a tall man with a shaved head and wore a simple gray suit. His handshake felt firm and confident.
""It's good to finally meet you, Mr. Davis,"" he said. ""I'm President Janssen. You must forgive us for not being able to come down to greet you when you arrived.""
""That's alright, sir,"" I replied. ""The whole world is watching right now so I don't think you can blame anyone else for that.""
We sat down and he asked me to tell him everything I had learned since arriving on Mars. After a couple hours of talking he stopped me mid sentence.
""So, what are your conclusions?"" he asked.
I told him about the alien ship that crashed on the surface of the planet and the creatures inside it. I explained that I thought the creatures were probably the same species as the ones living in the underground caverns and tunnels under the surface of the planet. I described them in detail and showed him some of the photos I'd taken during our journey.
""And you're certain these are the same kind of aliens that live beneath the surface?"" he asked.
I nodded.
""Well, that certainly makes things easier,"" he said. ""But I still need to understand exactly why these aliens decided to build ships like this.""
""You mean why they built their own space vessels? Why they left Earth behind?""
""Exactly,"" he replied. ""There are several possible answers to those questions. Some of them will be good and some won't. Which do you think is correct?""
My mind raced back to the alien ship in the crater. It looked like something that had been designed by humans, yet it seemed so alien to me. Was there any possibility that someone else had created it?
""If I had to guess, I'd say that whoever built this vessel did so because they believed that Earth had become too dangerous for them,"" I said. ""They saw humanity as a threat and needed to leave.""
""But that doesn't explain how they got here in the first place,"" he pointed out. ""How did they even find our planet?""
""Well, if they did indeed leave Earth, then perhaps they followed the same path as the other civilizations that have gone before us. They may have used some sort of wormhole or warp drive technology to travel between star systems.""
The president shook his head.
""No, that doesn't make sense either. We've studied every bit of data we have on ancient human history and nobody ever mentions any such thing. In fact, our best scientists agree that the only way we managed to reach the stars is by traveling via rocketships.""
""But maybe they didn't use rocketships,"" I suggested. ""Maybe they flew here using some other method.""
""Like what?""
""I don't know. Maybe they used some kind of wormholes, or hyperdrive engines.""
""What difference does it make if they came here by rocket or spaceship? What matters is whether they have the ability to communicate with us. And judging from what you've seen, they clearly can't.""
He paused and stared at me for a moment, thinking hard. Then he turned to me.
""Okay, let me ask you another question,"" he said. ""Are you absolutely certain that the creatures living beneath the surface are the same as the ones above ground?""
""Yes, sir. I'm completely sure of it.""
""Why?""
I hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to answer his question.
""Because... Well... I just am. It feels right to me, sir.""
He smiled at me.
""Thank you, Mr. Davis. Your instincts seem to be working just fine for once.""
As I walked away from the president's office I couldn't help smiling to myself. It was nice to know that someone actually believed me. The rest of the day was spent talking to different people within the administration. Everyone agreed that I was telling the truth. Even the president himself admitted that he wasn't entirely sure about the alien story, but that he was willing to listen to me. By nightfall I was exhausted from speaking to so many people. All I wanted to do was go home, take a shower and sleep.
I was lying in bed, listening to music and reading a book when there was a knock on my door. When I opened it I saw two men standing outside. One of them introduced himself as the head of security and handed me an envelope.
""This is a personal note from the president to you,"" he said. ""He wants you to open it in private, but he also asks that you read it aloud to him.""
I took the envelope and thanked him before closing the door. I carefully opened the envelope and pulled out a sheet of paper. The president's handwriting was neat and clear to read, despite his age.
""Mr. Davis,
""I have been thinking long and hard about your discovery. I realize that I cannot deny that you have uncovered evidence of a new alien race. But I also know that I cannot accept your claims without concrete proof. There is a great deal of work ahead of us and I hope that together we can continue to discover the truth. I would like to invite you to join me for a meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss the situation further. Please meet me in my office at 1:00 PM. I look forward to seeing you again.
""Sincerely,
""John Janssen, President of the United States of America.""
I read the letter to myself twice before putting it down and looking at the clock on my wall. It was already 11:30 PM so I knew that if I wanted to get enough sleep I'd better hit the sack soon.",1231,0.6698139493371872,0.21938219455519206,-0.7448381713467604,-1.2320318338879348,-0.20494201465679507
233,R_3rZXMpwmMli497X,FAN_HSF_3,Hard Sci-Fi,Fandango,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The president had just returned to Mars three weeks earlier, after serving a two-year stint as the president of the United States. He had left under controversial circumstances, but had come back much more confident than he'd been before going to Earth. I hadn't asked what made President Rama change his mind about returning to Mars; maybe he wanted to avoid the media attention, or maybe he didn't know himself.
I walked past the Martian embassy and entered the president's building, a white cube with a red stripe down its side. As soon as I was inside, I could see why he had requested that we meet there. The president's office was at one end of a large hall with glass windows on all four sides of it. There were no seats in the hallway, only long tables where various government officials and military officers were working on some project. I walked over to the window and looked out at the view of the city below. From here, all signs of human habitation were absent.
On Mars, everything was recycled and reused. All of the city's buildings, including this skyscraper, were made from locally grown materials, like sandstone. They were built using a method called modular construction, which was a type of 3D printing technology. When finished, you could lift each module, move it into place, and connect it to its neighbors.
""You have a visitor, Mr. Parker,"" said a voice right behind me. I turned around to find a tall woman standing there, dressed in a black business suit. She had her black hair cut short, and had a wide-eyed demeanor. In fact, she looked exactly like a certain former presidential candidate whose name started with a D.
Before I could react, another voice interrupted me. ""This is the man who was seen with my daughter. This is the man she was seen with? Is it?""
Dr. Sato quickly stepped between us. ""Mr. Parker, please calm yourself,"" she said in Japanese. ""This is a difficult time for him.""
""What are your intentions toward my daughter?"" demanded the man.
I had been wondering how I would manage this meeting, and now it seemed I didn't even need to. Dr. Sato put herself on the defensive, and I felt the president needed to step in. I walked away from the window and followed Dr. Sato up to the door of his office. She knocked on it three times very rapidly before opening it.
""Come in, come in, both of you,"" said the president, his hands folded together across his chest. He gestured to the couch on the other side of his desk, where Dr. Sato and I sat. He then took a seat on the edge of his desk, which was surrounded by several screens. On the screens were views of Mars, including the city of New Chusan and the landing site of Ares One.
President Rama stared at us. His brown eyes gave away nothing of what he was thinking, but behind them, I caught a glint of his thoughts. He was trying to find the best way to tell us that his daughter was missing and there was a chance she may never return.
""So..."" he began. ""You two know each other?""
Dr. Sato nodded. ""For many years now. We first met when I was still studying abroad and Mr. Parker's daughter was a student at the Tokyo University of Science. I have been trying to help her for many years now, but...""
She hesitated, unable to finish her sentence. I saw that the president understood what she meant immediately.
""Yes, I know about your efforts, Dr. Sato. Thank you for notifying me of this incident."" He cleared his throat and leaned forward. ""But this situation is different. My daughter has disappeared without a trace... and it is clear to me that she is no longer a part of your research team. I'm sure you realize that she's probably in great danger, and she'll need help to escape from this city before the police arrive...""
I stared at him, trying to absorb what he was saying. But Dr. Sato knew right away what he had just said, and her face went blank. ""President,"" she said. ""Please wait one moment. You're wrong.""
She stood up and walked over to stand in front of the president, looking directly into his eyes. He looked uncomfortable at first, but finally looked back at her.
""You were told she ran away because she's involved with illegal activities in the city. But you have no proof of this...""
The president frowned. ""I am aware of that.""
""Then I believe you should be the one to come to us, instead of the other way around,"" she said.
The president took a few moments to think about what she had said. Finally, he stood up and began to pace behind the desk. ""This is a delicate matter, Dr. Sato. I've been doing a lot of soul-searching ever since my daughter went missing, and I have realized something. I made a mistake in taking part in your research on the origin of life...""
I felt a chill run through me. Now they were talking about my daughter.
""It was the right decision at the time, given my political ambitions. I was afraid that if I didn't get involved, I would lose my support base, so I accepted an invitation to participate in the experiments...""
""And you never suspected that we might actually find something...?""
""... No. I don't think I did. My daughter was involved in the original experiments, but she was also a participant in the later ones. As far as I know, she didn't have any knowledge of how it all worked, and I don't recall her ever giving me any hints about her involvement in future projects. I thought she was just helping out on a project that might result in something useful for humanity, even though I didn't agree with that.""
Dr. Sato nodded. ""I understand. I appreciate you sharing all of this with us, President. So, can I ask you one thing?""
""If you have a question, by all means, ask.""
""What will happen to her?"" she asked. ""Will they keep her locked up somewhere until someone comes to collect her? Or will they try to do something horrible to her? Will she be killed? Killed for what she knows? What does she know that they don't want us to know?""
Dr. Sato was trying to keep herself from crying, but I could see that she wasn't hiding it very well. I was surprised that the president was willing to show so much emotion. Maybe he was really trying to make up for his mistakes. Then again, the last time we'd met, he'd said that he would do whatever was necessary to protect his daughter. Was there really a difference between those two things?",1213,-1.14062679758619,-0.9849110142319281,-0.32655366984802575,-0.8581963658270279,0.143705952746027
234,R_3hcO3EQa1t0Y1jI,ALL_HF_1,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""It is good,"" said Joron. ""This is where I will build my first ship.""
""We cannot stay long,"" said the captain. ""Not with so many ships at sea."" He glanced back at them. ""Are you ready?""
The crew nodded, and he turned to lead them down the slope of the hill toward the village. As they descended, the village became more defined. The smoke was thicker, and there were more birds and animals running around. The houses were larger and sturdier than those on the islands, though no one was home. No one was at their work, either, as far as Joron could see. He looked at the two towers again, wondering if he should have left a man there to keep an eye on the village while the rest of him went off to find his new ship. Then again, that was why they had been given such large numbers of men and women – so they could look after themselves.
He followed the captain into the village, and a few of the crew glanced back at the ships and made their way to them, taking up stations around the hulls. Joron felt the weight of responsibility settle on his shoulders as he walked between the houses, feeling their stares on him. The silence was almost tangible, as if the place held its breath in anticipation of what would come next.
They reached the lake and crossed to the shore. There were no boats tied up here. Joron glanced up at the tower nearest them. A small door stood open and he heard voices from inside.
""There is something strange about this place,"" said the captain. ""It feels…"" He looked at Joron.
""Like it wants something,"" said Joron.
""Aye. Something, and I do not like it. I don't want us to be here for too long. We need to find this ship before nightfall.""
""And if we cannot?"" asked Joron.
The captain shrugged. ""Then we will spend the night here. But I am not looking forward to it. This place gives me a bad feeling."" He glanced down at Joron, his expression serious. ""We must be careful.""
""Of what?"" asked Joron, but the captain did not answer. He turned and walked toward the tower and Joron fell in behind him. The captain rapped on the door, and the voices inside stopped talking. The captain spoke. ""Come. It is the captain of the fleet.""
The door opened, and the captain stepped in, followed by Joron. They both paused, taking in the sight before them. There were five men inside. Three sat around a table, eating bread and drinking wine. The other two were standing by the fire, and one was staring out into the valley while the other moved through a room that looked like an armory. A man stood by a door on the far side of the room. He was young, his hair cropped short, and he wore a heavy leather coat with a wide belt. He nodded to them as they entered.
""Captain,"" he said, then turned his attention back to the men at the table. ""You are early.""
""I am not a man who likes to waste time,"" said the captain, ""especially when there is work to be done.""
""Yes, well, we are still getting things ready."" One of the men at the table put his bread down.
""That will do for now,"" said the captain. ""If you would, take some wine from the table over there. It has been brought from the ships.""
Joron glanced at the captain, wondering if this was some test or a trick, but the captain nodded to him. So he picked up a cup and went to join the man standing by the fire. The man smiled and took the cup from him and poured it full of wine.
""This is good,"" said Joron. ""I have never seen wine like this before.""
The man nodded and smiled. ""It is called Tethys' Blood. It comes from here."" He pointed to the valley below. ""But you may not see much of it if your captain does not hurry.""
""I am hurrying,"" said the captain. ""We all are. Now, where is this ship you wish me to look at?""
""There."" The man pointed toward the door opposite the one they had entered. ""It's a small building in the forest near the lake. You'll need torches, I'm afraid.""
""Then bring them.""
The man left and Joron followed the captain out into the hall, taking a seat on a bench beside him. He felt eyes upon him as he sat down. They were curious, and he felt that it was more than just the men who lived here. There was something watching them, too, and he knew he should not look around to find out what it was, but curiosity got the better of him. He glanced past the captain to the two men in the room with the weapons. One was a big man, tall and broad, his arms and chest bulging out under the leather of his coat. He had a large axe in one hand and a sword in the other. The other man was younger, leaner, almost gaunt, with long black hair falling to his shoulders. His hands were covered in tattoos. Joron did not know what they meant, but there seemed to be a story to them.
The man was staring at him, his eyes narrowed and his lips pressed tight. It was not anger or hatred, but a stare that spoke of a cold calculation, one that told Joron he could die at any moment.
Joron turned back to the captain and took a sip of wine. He felt the warmth in his chest and smiled. ""Is this ship really so important?"" he asked.
""It is,"" said the captain, ""and we do not have time to waste.""
""We are only a few days away from our destination. Surely we can stay another day or two?""
""No."" The captain stood up. ""We need to be off soon. We cannot be seen to be hanging about."" He glanced over to the two men in the room with the weapons. ""You will come with us."" He pointed toward the door. ""The rest of you remain here.""
The big man nodded. ""As you say, Captain.""
The smaller man shook his head. ""I am not coming.""
""What? You cannot leave me alone in this place.""
The man laughed. ""I am not leaving you alone. I'm staying with my brother."" He walked over to where the big man stood beside the fire. They shared a long look and then both laughed, and Joron found himself smiling along with them.
""I hope you have more than wine in your stores,"" said the big man.
""There's plenty, don't worry.""",1206,-1.0057765717319698,1.3683077116269542,0.7348335163549415,-0.11193843532939039,-0.8992080556753299
235,R_1rekYromDpVDCQn,ACE_HR_3,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He watched her drink from her cup while she stared out the window. Her gaze seemed to be fixed on nothing. The woman's eyes were dark brown—the color of rich chocolate, not black as so many people thought. She wore a simple dress that fell just above her knees with long sleeves. There wasn't any lace or embroidery; it was plain but very pretty. She had auburn hair and full lips, which made him think she must have been beautiful once upon a time. But now, with age and sorrow etched onto her face, she looked even more tragic.
""Why are you sitting here all by yourself?"" he asked when he went over to refill her cup. ""It looks like you're waiting for someone.""
She turned and looked up at him, and he couldn't look away. Something about her drew him in, something he couldn't put his finger on. Maybe it was because she was beautiful yet sad. Or maybe it was simply because no one else was around and she seemed so alone.
He walked back to the bar and filled another mug. When he returned, she still hadn't said anything. She was staring at the table, looking down at her hands resting on top of it. It occurred to him then how pale they were. And cold.
""Would you like some food? I'm going to go get you something,"" he told her.
Her head snapped toward him. His heart skipped a beat. It took everything within him not to reach out and touch her.
""I'll order you something special,"" he whispered, unable to take his eyes off her.
His voice sounded too loud, almost harsh, in comparison to her soft tone.
""No thanks. I'm fine,"" she replied.
He didn't want to leave her there, alone, but he knew she wouldn't eat unless he ordered it for her. He glanced outside. The snowfall had started again. Soon it would be coming down hard enough to block anyone from seeing them if they decided to run. He knew she'd probably try to do that, though.
As soon as he reached the door, she stood. He held it open for her, and she stepped through. They both stopped. Then, slowly, she smiled at him. It was such a sweet smile, and it transformed her entire countenance. Suddenly, he wanted to hold her against him, to pull her close to him. To protect her from whatever hurt had taken up residence inside her body.
""Thank you, sir,"" she said.
""My pleasure. Have a good night.""
He shut the door behind her and locked it. As soon as he did, he ran back to the counter.
""What did you say your name was?""
""Hannah. Hannah McAllister.""
""Hannah, I'm Connor. What can I get for you tonight?""
""A glass of wine, please. Red is my favorite.""
He nodded, smiling to himself. She was such a lovely young woman, and she was alone. For the first time since he'd arrived, he felt a little hope. Hope that she might actually stay here in town instead of running off to find her father.
""Coming right up.""
Connor poured her a glass of red wine and brought it over. She thanked him before taking a sip. She looked so small sitting there, drinking alone. Even though she was eating dinner, she didn't seem to enjoy what she was having. Connor wondered why she'd chosen this place to dine. Surely somewhere else would offer better food than this.
When he finished serving his other customers, he hurried over to check on Hannah. Her glass was empty, and she'd pushed her plate away.
""Is everything alright?""
""Yes, thank you,"" she said softly.
She leaned forward and rested her elbows on the table. Her shoulders slumped, and she sighed.
""You know, we don't usually let guests sit at the bar, but you've been so nice to me that I'll make an exception. Would you mind joining me?""
She shook her head, but she smiled, so he sat beside her.
""Tell me about yourself. Do you live around here?""
She hesitated before answering. ""Not exactly. I came here with my sister after our parents died. We planned to stay only long enough to find our dad, but…""
She trailed off and looked away.
""But?"" he prompted when she didn't continue.
""I never found him.""
Connor rubbed his hand along his jawline. ""And now you're staying here?""
She shrugged.
""Where are you from?""
Again, she hesitated.
""Come on, Hannah. Tell me where you're from. Who's your family?""
She laughed, but it was bitter and dry.
""Oh, I wish I could tell you who my family is, Connor. My father has a farm in West Virginia. He left us to marry another woman, and now he doesn't even acknowledge our existence anymore. So yes, I am staying here. In the inn. With you. Until I figure out what I should do next.""
""So, you're just passing through? You don't plan to settle down here in Havenport?""
She shook her head. ""No. No, I don't think I will. This city isn't big enough for me. Besides, I don't have anywhere else to go. My sister won't help me.""
""Well, you know where to come if you ever need help. I'm always here.""
She nodded.
""Do you have any plans for tomorrow?""
She cocked her head to one side. ""Tomorrow? Why?""
""Nothing specific, but if you want, I could show you around the city. Just to see what's available.""
She thought for a moment. ""That sounds wonderful. Thank you.""
They talked late into the night. Hannah was more talkative and less morose than she'd been earlier in the day. Connor was surprised by how much he enjoyed their conversation.
The next morning, he woke up early. He checked on Hannah, and she was sound asleep. He made breakfast and waited for her to wake up. When she finally did, she was ready to start her tour of Havenport.
She was dressed in the same clothes from yesterday, and he thought she looked more comfortable in them. They were simple, yet she looked more feminine. He liked it.
By lunchtime, they were both tired and hungry. Connor had made reservations at one of the restaurants in the downtown area. They walked to the restaurant and were seated in a quiet corner.
The food was delicious. Hannah was enjoying herself more than she'd been all week, and she looked happier.",1109,0.7919071051316784,-0.7950305411405626,-0.33443924198861175,-1.0526210037012074,0.8994351032643649
236,R_1dgcieaHde9SNXn,MOR_HF_4,High Fantasy,Morpho,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is the place?"" Thea asked.
""This is where we're to meet with the rest of our party,"" said the driver. ""I don't know what we're supposed to do once we get there.""
""That's not our problem,"" said Vaelin. ""I'm sure they'll tell us in due course.""
A horseman appeared on the hilltop above the village and looked down at them through a pair of spyglasses.
""That looks like one of them,"" said the driver, nodding towards the hilltop. ""My word, he's got a long way to go with that thing. I remember when he was just a lad.""
""He's not a lad,"" said Vaelin. ""He's my brother.""
""Oh, I know,"" said the driver dismissively. ""I mean he's still got most of his hair.""
""That's because he doesn't use it to hang himself with.""
The driver chuckled and shook his head in amusement, then nodded to Vaelin before swinging down from the carriage and leading his horse away towards the village.
Vaelin looked up at the hilltop again and saw that the man in the spyglass had mounted his horse and was riding off, vanishing around a bend in the valley.
""Come on then,"" he said to Thea. ""Let's find a place to wait until they're ready for us.""
A couple of hours later, they were ushered into a large tent on the edge of a small clearing at the heart of the encampment. The interior was lined with benches and chairs, while a table occupied most of the space in front of them. Atop it sat a pile of papers and maps while a man who looked to be about Vaelin's age stood near the flap, looking down over them. His hair was cut short and he wore a pair of spectacles which appeared more ornamental than practical.
""Good day,"" he said when he saw them enter. ""I'm Thane Leveret, headman here."" He gestured at a chair and smiled as they both took their seats upon it. ""So you're Lord Vaelin's brother?""
Thea looked at Vaelin questioningly but he merely nodded and took his place beside her.
""I've been looking forward to meeting you,"" said Leveret, sitting down opposite them. ""It's rare that we see a member of House D'Lorus here in the southlands.""
""And I've been looking forward to meeting you as well, Thane,"" said Vaelin with an easy smile. ""And I'm sure you've been looking forward to meeting me as well.""
Leveret regarded him gravely for a moment, then laughed and clapped his hands together, prompting Vaelin to do likewise.
""Well, in that case,"" said Leveret, ""I'm sure we'll get along just fine."" He tapped the table with his fingertips. ""Now then, these are maps and reports I've collected from various sources over the years which I believe will be of interest to you."" Vaelin leaned forward eagerly to look at them but Leveret raised a hand and forestalled their examination.
""It would be best if you took a look while we discuss what's being done here."" He paused for a moment and looked down at the map on the table. ""As you're no doubt aware, there have been several incidents of men being attacked while out hunting or fishing late at night over the last few years."" He paused again, then looked up into Vaelin's eyes. ""Our source of information is rather unreliable but our reports indicate that all these men died by means of some kind of poisonous dart-like weapon which is only deployed when its victim is in sight of its sender. We also know that each victim was found dead in an area some distance from where they were attacked."" He smiled again and Vaelin saw that his teeth were uneven, badly stained by some kind of herb or other. ""There's been no sign of any kind of weapon or clothing or anything like that left behind so as you can imagine we have very little information to go on."" He leaned forward slightly and pointed at one particular spot on the map with his finger. ""This is where your brother was attacked some years ago."" He paused again, then looked up at Vaelin again with an expectant smile. ""Now you see why your presence here is important. You have much more experience than any of us here with such matters and if I may say so your brother is not renowned for his intellect."" Leveret sat back, his smile fading to nothing as he regarded Vaelin's face with some confusion and concern. ""Now then, I know we've only just met but could I get your advice on this matter? I'll be honest with you I don't know what else to do.""
Vaelin nodded slowly as he scanned the map again, wondering what kind of trap he was being led into here but also hoping that perhaps there was some way out after all. He saw Thea watching him carefully but she said nothing, simply watched Leveret's face as he waited for an answer he already knew was coming.
""Yes,"" he replied at length. ""You could search for whatever is responsible for these attacks and if it proves to be human then you could eliminate anyone who might have knowledge of it."" He paused again and Leveret raised his eyebrows expectantly but Vaelin went on regardless. ""But I'm sure that would be difficult if not impossible if your source is as unreliable as it seems."" He smiled again, this time more broadly than before and Leveret looked like he'd been slapped across the face by a particularly ugly woman when Vaelin continued softly. ""Or perhaps there is something within this encampment which may be responsible?"" He pointed at one particular spot on the map where several roads converged just outside the village walls. ""If it is someone here then it would make sense to make whatever preparations are necessary before trying to find them."" The smile vanished from Leveret's face as Vaelin continued speaking, his voice dropping in volume as he approached the end of his answer. ""Or perhaps it would be best if you simply moved these people somewhere else so they aren't in danger?"" He looked up at Leveret who appeared confused by what he was hearing, then smiled again before standing up from his seat and speaking quickly before his host had time to reply. ""I really must be going now but I'll stop by tomorrow evening so we can discuss what you intend to do.""
He turned away from Leveret and waited for Thea to do the same before leading her outside into the clearing where a large group of armed men had gathered around some sort of campfire which was burning merrily upon a large pile of logs and brushwood. They were all wearing leather armour over sturdy mail shirts and their weapons were laid out neatly against one side of a long table which had been set up nearby. The table was covered in maps and charts and also bore several large wooden boxes which were open at one end revealing an array of knives, swords, spears and other weapons all laid out in neat rows upon several layers of cloth atop it.",1270,0.20675257177669648,0.3610994839747188,-0.6463472283711108,-0.9407608812467083,-0.5651313500409207
237,R_2zAdQ2n7EHd4WSV,BAS_HOR_6,Horror,Basic Coherence,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had red eyes with long white hair that went down to its shoulders. The person's skin was pale and wrinkly. Its mouth was open in an O shape as if it were screaming. I screamed too when I saw what was behind the face. There was a large black mass moving toward me. My scream turned into a shriek as my body began shaking uncontrollably.
The next thing I knew, I was lying on the floor crying. I felt like I couldn't breathe and my heart was beating so fast it hurt. I tried to get up but every time I moved, I would fall back down onto the floor. Finally, I managed to crawl to the door. I pushed the button for the nurse call light and waited. A few minutes later, someone came running into my room.
""What happened?"" he asked. ""Are you okay? What happened?"" He helped me sit up. Once I could see straight, I told him what I saw. Then, I started sobbing.
He took off his jacket and wrapped it around my shoulders. ""It's all right,"" he said. ""You're safe now.""
I nodded through my tears. As soon as I calmed down enough, we left the room together. We walked down the hallway and then stopped outside another door. He knocked on it and then opened it. Inside was a small bathroom. He pointed to the toilet and then left.
I sat on the edge of the seat and let out a sigh. I didn't know why I was still scared after seeing what I did. Maybe because I'd been awake since I was little and I never really slept. I closed my eyes and fell asleep sitting up. I dreamed about the woman with the red eyes staring at me in the mirror. She smiled and her teeth were sharp like knives. In the dream, she was coming closer and closer. Her hands reached for me and I woke up to find myself covered in sweat.
When I looked in the mirror, the woman wasn't there anymore. Instead, I saw a young girl who reminded me of the one in my dream. Her skin was pale and she had dark brown hair that hung past her waist. She wore a dress made of white lace and pearls. Her smile was kind and warm. I wanted to go to her and ask her what she meant by calling me. But before I could reach her, she disappeared.
I washed my face and brushed my teeth. After I finished, I put on my clothes and went back to my room. The nurse gave me some medicine to help me sleep. Before I drifted off to sleep, I heard the sound of knocking on glass.

238,R_dhS0IFR5m29P4nn,MOR_HSF_7,Hard Sci-Fi,Morpho,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. ""Have a nice day, Commander,"" she said and returned to her lab.
I sat down on the front steps of the building and pulled out the letter. It was a short missive, written in the president's neat, small block letters:
""Dear Commander Bekker,
I'm sorry to inform you that I'll be unable to accompany you to Olympus Mons on your next mission. I trust you'll be able to find my replacement here in the science division. I know you have a lot of work to do before your trip, so I'll meet with you as soon as possible to discuss the particulars of your mission with Dr. Sato.
I've enclosed a list of names of qualified candidates who might be able to assist you. Let me know if any of them look promising.
Sincerely,
(Your friend and employer, President William Jefferson Clinton)
P.S. Feel free to take a couple of days off for your trip down to the equator. It's much warmer there this time of year, so you'll probably be glad for it.""
I unfolded the letter again and gave it a quick reading. There was nothing in it that really surprised me, but there was something about it that made my stomach churn. The president had been very clear about how he felt about me in his initial briefing. I understood that he wanted me to go on this mission, but I also knew that he would never have approved it if he hadn't been desperate for someone to go down there and get this data back for him. He was just using me as a pawn in his political games with Congress and the UN. There was no way that I could believe anything he said, or that he would have approved the mission if he really wanted me to go back down there.
I put the letter back into my pocket and stood up, my head already in a fog from the lack of sleep. I had two choices: I could either refuse to go on this mission, or I could go down there and get the information. If I refused it would be obvious that I was only using my own career advancement to advance my standing with the president, which would make me look dishonest and untrustworthy. Any respect that I had gained from this president would be gone in an instant, and it would probably cost me my job. So, what choice did I really have?
I decided to go down to Dr. Sato's lab right away, even though it wasn't until two o'clock that I was supposed to be meeting with her. As I walked down the street toward the lab, I couldn't help but notice how different everything looked from the bottom of Olympus Mons. The buildings here were much shorter than they were on Earth; there was very little vegetation; and there were no cars or people to be seen anywhere that I could see. There was a certain sense of serenity here that was missing from Earth, but there was also something melancholy about it all too. After a few minutes of walking, I reached Dr. Sato's lab and walked inside.
""Hi Jake!"" she said as she saw me walk in. ""I'm glad you made it here on time."" She held out her hand for me to shake before walking over to her computer terminal and pulling up one of her files and bringing up another one on her monitor. ""We only have less than an hour before we're supposed to meet with President Clinton,"" she said as she turned around and looked at me expectantly. ""What do you want me to show you first?""
""I want to see all of your research on the magnetic fields on Mars,"" I said quickly. ""Then we can get right into whatever other information you can give me.""
""Just give me a minute,"" she said as she tapped a button on her computer. ""Here we go,"" she said smiling at me as she turned around and started scrolling through her files on her monitor screen. ""Let's see now…"" She kept scrolling through her files until she found what she was looking for: a thick folder labeled ""Mars Magnetic Field Research."" She pulled up the first file and started reading off its contents:
""Mars's magnetic field has been measured by satellites since the early 1970s,"" she read off from her monitor screen, ""and has remained unchanged since then."" She stopped reading after a few seconds and looked at me with a smile on her face. ""Here,"" she continued, ""is an article from the National Science Foundation journal with all of my research papers on Mars's magnetic field."" She tapped a button on her computer and brought up another screen with a detailed explanation of how Mars's magnetic field had remained unchanged since the 1970s. She turned around again and smiled at me as she leaned back in her chair. ""That's all I've got for you on Mars's magnetic field,"" she said looking at me with a puzzled expression on her face. ""Do you need anything else?""
""No, that's fine,"" I said quickly and turned around to leave without saying another word. ""I'll see you later,"" I said without looking back at her as I walked out of her lab into the hallway.
I felt disappointed again as I left Dr. Sato's lab without being given any other information about my mission or what kind of equipment I would be using down there on Olympus Mons. I knew that Dr. Sato had been working here for years now, so she probably had plenty of information about this planet's geography and its climate conditions, but it still seemed strange to me that she wouldn't even give me any general information about what kind of equipment I would need for this mission or what kind of research she had done here before. She seemed so sure about everything when we first met yesterday—but now she couldn't even tell me anything about Mars's magnetic field or its atmosphere?
As I walked back home, I tried to figure out what she could possibly know that she wasn't telling me, but there was nothing that came to mind at first glance. The only thing that came to mind was what President Clinton had told me: ""Feel free to take a couple of days off for your trip down to the equator."" If she knew where the equator was, then maybe she could tell me where it was? But what good would that do? All it would do is point me in the right direction toward one of the most important discoveries in human history: the discovery of life on another planet! So why wouldn't she share that information with me? And why wouldn't she tell me anything about Mars's magnetic field?
As I got back into my apartment and sat down at my computer terminal, all these questions suddenly came rushing back into my head as I tried to figure out why Dr. Sato would keep information from me like this—and whether or not this meant that Dr. Sato was lying about being my friend or not. The only way to find out was to go back downstairs and ask her again—assuming that she hadn't already changed her mind about wanting to help me in any way whatsoever!
I logged into my e-mail account and quickly pulled up her e-mail address from yesterday without even thinking twice about it, opened it up again and sent an e-mail off right away:
""Dr. Sato,"" I typed out quickly, ""I need some help with something."" A few seconds later my computer terminal chimed loudly and flashed red letters across my screen: ""E-MAIL FROM JACOB BECKER: DR. SATO."" It displayed a link underneath so that I could click on it if I wanted to open up her e-mail messages from yesterday or today with just one click instead of being forced to scroll down through every single one of them separately by clicking on their individual links from yesterday or today.",1410,0.4875813507720884,1.7602476414604147,0.4613613004955075,0.14490113523426376,1.2546547729845103
239,R_2pRKxi8uLo91NmO,MOR_HR_6,Historical Romance,Morpho,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd taken her order—a pitcher of beer and a plate of cheese, bread, and sausage—and had gone to fetch it. When he returned, she was still sitting there.
She was dressed in a simple dress, the fabric rough and brown and very familiar. He knew the smell of it, and it was the smell of home. He'd been away for so long that he almost didn't recognize the dress as one of his mother's. At first he thought she was a runaway who'd taken refuge in his mother's house, and he had started to think about what he would do if that was the case. He hadn't realized that she was a girl until he had put the pitcher of beer on the table in front of her and she'd stood to take it from him.
She was a girl, a young woman really, but he still couldn't get over the thought that she was a runaway. He could see it in her eyes. There were still a lot of questions he had about what had happened to bring her to this place and what she was doing there, but there was no point in asking them now. She'd paid for the beer and left without saying a word.
And so he'd sat with his beer until the tavern closed that night, staring at the spot where she'd been sitting.
The next day he went to his mother's house and asked if she had a runaway daughter staying with her.
She hadn't, but she'd said something about a strange young woman coming to the house on the day before. She hadn't known anything about her.
That night he'd gone to work at the tavern again, but this time he sat at one of the tables in front of them. He'd pretended to be waiting for an order, just to see if she would come back.
She had come back that night with another pitcher of beer and a plate of cheese, bread, and sausage. He hadn't taken her order this time but stayed at his table and watched her eat. She was polite to everyone else around her but didn't look him in the eye once when she sat down at his table. She ate silently and then left.
But the next night she came back again. The next day and the next night after that too. She even brought gifts for his mother—a bottle of wine for her and a basket of cheese, bread, and sausage for him. When she came in the last night, she looked him directly in the eye and smiled. She said nothing about why she was there or why she always sat at his table. She paid for her beer and left again without saying anything.
The next morning he woke up with a pounding headache—he'd only drunk one pitcher of beer last night—and went out on his horse to look for her. He wandered around for days until he finally found her sitting by herself in a tavern along the road to Zilva. He sat down with her and drank his beer while she ate some cheese and sausage from her basket.
""How did you come to be here?"" he asked after a while.
She laughed at him. ""I don't remember,"" she said. ""I don't remember anything about myself.""
""What did you do?"" he asked.
""I ran away,"" she said simply. ""I don't remember how.""
""Why?""
""I don't know,"" she said again. ""I don't remember.""
""I see."" He nodded slowly. ""How old are you?""
She looked down at the table between them where her basket sat beside him. ""I'm not sure,"" she said after a while. ""I don't remember.""
He looked at her searchingly, trying not to stare at her as he did so, but she didn't look away from him when he did so anyway. After a while, he looked back down at his own basket and continued eating slowly so that he didn't have to look up again at her face too quickly.
""What's your name?"" he asked after a while.
""I don't know,"" she said quietly after a while as well, looking down at her basket again where it sat next to him on the table between them again as well. ""I don't remember.""
""How old are you?"" he asked quietly after a minute or two more of silence between them both as they ate cheese and sausage from their baskets without saying anything else for a time now.
She looked at him again, and this time there was anger in her eyes when she looked up at him again as well. ""Do you really want to know?"" she asked after a moment or two of silence between them again now as well though.",830,-0.2137466977792115,-0.7597608356708919,0.12742550740648736,0.14817309102270357,-0.01655256203766862
240,R_2tllaq0dAHoarPp,FAN_HR_7,Historical Romance,Fandango,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He hadn't recognized her at first, not until she spoke to the man beside her. Then it all came back to him-the day she had saved his life. The same day he'd lost hers.
Now she was here again, in the village where he lived, the very village that he hated because she had lived there, too. It made no sense. She must have moved away after the fire burned their family home, after he'd left to find work in another town. He would have remembered if she had stayed behind. But now she was back and he couldn't escape the thought that everything had led up to this moment.
This woman had ruined the rest of his life. Why should he care that she had returned? It would only make matters worse, as though the fire and the loss of his family had not been bad enough. Still . . . she was beautiful.
She looked much younger than he remembered, but she still had a kind of innocence about her eyes. They were large and blue and framed by thick dark lashes. Her skin was flawless, pale almost white, as though she never ventured out in the sun. Her hair was as black as night, the strands twisted up off her head so that only her face was visible, but it fell down over one shoulder and brushed her breastbone. Her dress was simple brown, long enough to touch the ground. There was nothing in it to attract attention, but then, why would she need to attract anyone's attention? She'd never be able to marry anyone in the village because everyone knew what she'd done.
And yet, even knowing all that, she was still very attractive. How could he have let her go? And now he wouldn't be able to stop thinking about her; he would always see her when he closed his eyes. And in his dreams, he would have her again and feel that terrible pain she had caused.
It was the wrong sort of woman for him. She was too innocent, too trusting. The way he felt today—he would never be able to keep himself from using her and then leaving her when he got what he wanted. It went against his nature, but that didn't mean he could control it.
""I'm sorry I kept you waiting,"" she said, coming around the table and dropping into the chair next to him. ""You're sitting on my knee. My name is Isabella.""
He was surprised; she hadn't given him time to reply before she started talking.
He looked at her in surprise. ""Your knee?"" His own voice sounded flat, empty of passion. How could he feel anything toward this woman? He was a rake and she was a saint.
There was a note of challenge in her voice. ""What do you mean?""
He shook his head. How could she possibly want him? What she did was wrong. Wasn't it, though? Everyone else seemed to think so. But he wasn't going to argue. He was a rake, and he had been raked.
Isabella smiled. ""I'm sorry if I've offended your sense of propriety. It's just that I don't want you to think I'm trying to seduce you, or any such thing. I don't want to frighten you.""
""Why would you do something like that?"" he asked. He had to know. She was too intriguing a creature for him not to want to hear her story. He was still young and strong and virile. Why shouldn't he enjoy a little diversion before he married someone proper and settled down to raise children?
Her brow furrowed. ""That's what you're wondering, isn't it? That's why I asked you to meet me here. I thought you might ask that question. It's important that I answer it.""
""I'm not sure I understand.""
She smiled a bit shyly. ""When you asked to see me, it wasn't so much out of desire, although that helped, I suppose. I didn't plan this when I first met you.""
""You planned on seducing me?"" He laughed, but there was nothing funny about his laughter. It was just a release, to get rid of the pain.
""I didn't plan on having my hand burned.""
""But you still came to see me.""
""Yes.""
""Why?""
""I don't know,"" she admitted.
He shrugged. If she'd had her hand burned because of him, what did that matter? It wasn't as though she would remember anything once he left her.
""I wanted you to tell the village that I'm not a witch."" She spoke almost hesitantly, as though afraid he would somehow know who she was.
""So that's what it was all about?""
She nodded.
He looked at her and suddenly realized how strange their relationship had been up to this point. There had been an attraction between them the first time he'd seen her, before she saved his life. They seemed to have some sort of understanding, as if they'd known each other from somewhere before this, but neither of them had spoken a word to the other until the night of the bonfire.
They had never actually shared a conversation. He couldn't remember what she had looked like and she couldn't remember how he had looked. There had been a bond between them, though, an intangible something that was there whenever they were together. Now it was broken.
""All right. Tell them whatever you want.""
""Thank you."" She seemed embarrassed.
He looked around. This wasn't a place to talk. There were too many people here, listening to every word. ""Let me buy you a drink,"" he suggested. ""We'll talk more privately later on.""
She smiled. ""That would be wonderful.""
They stepped into the bar and ordered drinks. They were served by two girls who were serving beer and ale to some customers. As they waited for their drinks, the girl with the empty pitcher leaned over the counter.
""Hey, Isabella,"" she called to her. ""Did you know there's a big snake in your garden?""
Isabella laughed, as though it was funny. ""I'm not sure. Do we have a snake in our garden?""
""Yeah. It's huge, bigger than a wolf. It's been in the yard for three days now. You better check on it.""
Isabella laughed again. ""That's funny. Thanks for the warning, though. Maybe you should tell Mr. Jenkins about it.""
The girl looked confused. ""What do you mean?""
""Mr. Jenkins lives right next door to you."" Isabella smiled at the girl.",1116,-1.4031210194330372,-0.8094568320228506,-1.167858622861939,-0.5938875674497613,-0.6235446355596461
241,R_2ahR41HdT92KS2j,FAN_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,Fandango,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. At least it would last me through the night, but as I hurried through the city streets, I wondered how much longer I'd be able to keep waking up at four o'clock in the morning without feeling like I was going crazy or dying.
My walk down the long hallways toward the president's inner office was uneventful, and I got there just after 1 PM. As always, his assistant, Ms. Hsu, greeted me at the door when I arrived and led me into a small conference room where President Sato awaited. He had been working late the previous evening, so I knew he wanted to speak with me in private, which was why I'd asked Ms. Hsu to let him know I was coming.
When he opened the door and saw me, he stood up from behind his desk and smiled. ""Good afternoon, Mr. Smith,"" he said, extending his hand.
""Mr. President,"" I replied, clasping it firmly before letting go. We then sat down in front of his desk and he placed his own envelope on top of a stack of papers on his table. ""Did you sleep well?"" he asked me.
""Very well, thank you,"" I answered. ""Your letter was unexpected, but I've read it three times now.""
""And what did it tell you?"" he asked.
I hesitated. ""I don't think I should say,"" I told him. ""It contains sensitive information about our current situation.""
He frowned. ""Please forgive my lack of faith, Mr. Smith. I know you are well aware of all the events taking place at this very moment, and I am certain you will understand how important it is for us to share this information with each other.""
""You're right, sir,"" I said. ""But I have a promise to keep.""
""Then perhaps I can make this easier for you,"" he suggested. ""You have the option of reading the entire letter, or simply listening to me summarize its contents. Which do you prefer?""
I thought about the question a moment. ""How much time will it take me to listen to what you have to say?""
""Not long at all,"" he assured me. ""Perhaps five or ten minutes.""
""In that case,"" I answered, ""the letter will help me remember some of the details. If I read it myself, I won't pay as much attention.""
""Very well,"" he conceded. ""I'll begin.""
After he finished reading the entire message, he explained to me everything he had learned. I then listened to his summary, and after each paragraph, I wrote a brief notation in my notebook. Finally, when the interview was over, I thanked him and walked out of his office.
The walk back to my apartment was long, and I had to stop for a moment once I reached its doors to collect my thoughts. In many ways, the letter was disturbing, but I found myself more shocked by what I'd learned of our president's personal life than anything else. Not to mention the fact that his words were laced with enough hints as to who was involved in these events to leave no doubt in my mind.
As soon as I stepped inside my apartment, however, my mind began working overtime, and by the time I laid down for a nap, the letter and its contents were still fresh in my mind. The only thing that prevented me from falling immediately asleep was the thought that I needed to check the weather report before heading out again. So instead, I climbed out of bed and began preparing for another long, late-night walk into town.
It wasn't easy, and the heat was intense, but I managed to get to the weather station before the sunset. I was hoping to find some answers regarding what had happened at our research facility, but when I entered the building, there was nobody around. I tried my best to remain calm, and to think logically, but when I saw the blood spatter on the wall near the entrance, and when I realized the security guard's body was lying next to it, I couldn't help myself.
I ran outside and began screaming. I didn't even know what to say or why I was shouting, but I knew I had to make noise, so I continued screaming as if it would help me somehow. Then, after several moments of hysterics, I finally calmed down and looked around me. To my surprise, all the other people in the area had also noticed what was happening and were rushing toward me.
I could only imagine how terrified they must have felt. After all, no one in their right mind gets excited when they see someone scream. But the truth was, nobody in the crowd seemed too surprised to see me running around in the desert with tears flowing down my cheeks. They simply stared at me until I stopped crying and then walked away. I didn't care, though. I was relieved when I saw the police arrive and began questioning me.
I'm not sure how many questions were asked, but I remember being asked them all. When I didn't answer quickly enough or with the proper words, I was accused of using drugs or something similar. And although I was eventually freed and allowed to return home, they did take samples from me, and I was informed that I wouldn't be allowed to enter any restricted areas for two weeks. Fortunately, I'd made it home when all of this happened. Otherwise, I'm sure the police would have detained me for the duration of my trip to Mars.
I've never been so glad to see the inside of my apartment before. In fact, I'd almost forgotten how much I hated that place. It was so dark, the furniture was ugly, and the walls were stained with stains that no amount of cleaning would ever remove. The only thing I loved about it was the bed. It reminded me of the one I'd slept in at home, and despite the dirt and dust, there was nothing wrong with it. I was exhausted and went straight to sleep the second I crawled inside.
The first thing I did when I woke up the following morning was look out of my bedroom window. As I expected, the weather was beautiful, and the air was clear. That meant my walk into town was going to be nice and easy.
After a quick shower, I ate breakfast and headed out the door. My apartment was only a few kilometers from the center of town, so as soon as I stepped outside, I started walking in the opposite direction. By the time I'd gotten to the edge of the city, I was already sweating, and by the time I got to my destination, I was soaked.
That was my second surprise of the day—I'd assumed the weather was always like this, but I'd actually forgotten about the atmosphere being thinner here on Mars. As I approached the research station, my eyes began adjusting to the sunlight and I could see that something was definitely amiss. Most of the buildings there had been torn down, there was blood splattered all over the ground, and the smell of smoke mixed with death was in the air.
I decided to wait and see what the police wanted me to do, since it appeared to be my task to find out who was responsible for this mess.",1300,0.35469663728559375,-0.5417628292831499,-0.7252843848706839,0.023573208053479722,0.9758859007429734
242,R_21bv0ekpgTiseot,OUR_HR_4,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her hair was black and unruly; her skin dark and sallow. But the eyes! Those green eyes had been like daggers. It was as if she knew everything about him, had heard the darkest of his secrets. The sight of her made him feel... dirty.
But as she was led up the gangplank by a sailor who called himself her husband, she looked so sad—so lost. Her expression seemed to say that she didn't want any part of what her life had become. He didn't blame her.
That first day, he watched her with an insatiable desire to know her better. When he was supposed to be working, he'd follow her from the kitchen where she washed dishes to the corner of the tavern, where she took a quick bath before bed. It was like he could see her through the windows, and even though the blinds were always closed, the room was illuminated by moonlight.
And she seemed to sense that he was watching her, too. When she walked out of the kitchen wearing her shift and the lace headpiece that her mother had made for her, she smiled at him shyly over her shoulder and said, ""Thank you again for helping me find work here."" Then she walked toward the door, never looking back, but there was something in her eyes, something almost pleading...
He knew she had no choice but to accept whatever her husband chose for her, so he did the only thing he could: he started paying attention to her, but not with his eyes or ears, no, he did it with his body. He made sure she knew that he noticed everything about her, every curve, every mark, every dimple in her face. And when he held her, he felt the tension in her body, the need that she kept hidden so well.
It wasn't enough for him to just watch her. He had to touch her as well. And when the opportunity arose, he took her. He held her and kissed her and fucked her, and the whole time, she gave herself to him willingly—or at least that's how he saw it.
The way she moaned in his arms was intoxicating, the way she arched into him, the way her breath hitched in her throat, the way her legs wrapped around his waist—it all fueled his desire. It made him wonder what else she would do if she knew he was the one who took her over and over again...
Then she stopped returning his letters, his cards, his gifts.
She never once told him why she couldn't talk to him anymore, she never sent a letter back saying that she didn't want to see him ever again. But after more than two months of silence, he'd given up all hope. So much time had passed that he felt like he could never make things right between them.
But then, just before the first snow, he received a note from her. In it, she thanked him again for the work he'd done on the house, and told him she'd be returning in three days' time. The last sentence caught his eye, though—she told him to take care of himself, because she wasn't sure when she'd return.
He wondered what had happened to change things so much. But she hadn't been specific, so there was no point in asking her questions. He was just glad that she'd written again, and he spent the next several days waiting for her with anticipation and dread.
When she came back, he'd been working in the tavern. He'd gone straight from bed to the bar to find her sitting alone at a table near the kitchen. She looked around nervously as he approached, but he only smiled and said, ""I'm so happy you've come home."" Then he reached out and touched her hand.
She stared at him with a guarded expression, but he thought he saw a hint of something else—a question, maybe?—in her eyes. It was enough. He wanted to hear whatever she had to say.
""You look tired,"" he said.
Her face fell as he spoke, and then she began to weep. The sight of her made his heart clench. He took her hand in his, then led her back to the room where they'd made love, and he held her while she cried into his chest. He told her he was sorry, that he'd thought he'd known what he wanted, but now that she was there with him, he didn't want her to leave again.
And when the tears subsided, she told him that she wanted to stay. That it was too easy for her to just disappear like this. He could see the pain in her face as she told him this. But he also saw that she felt trapped by her husband, and he knew that if he asked her to run away with him, she'd never do it. He understood why; the last thing she needed was to put herself in danger.
So he tried to help her as best he could. He did everything he could think of, and it wasn't long before she stopped crying, and started smiling. Soon, her energy returned. And she found work again in the tavern kitchen, where she helped prepare the food for the sailors who came through on their way to the islands, or back home. She made enough to take care of herself and her mother, so she was happy.
He was, too.
As time passed, the tavern became a safe haven for them both, a place they could be together without the worry of being caught. He cared for her, loved her, protected her. But that all came at a price...
In the spring, when she was still fifteen years old, she told him that she was pregnant with his baby.
That was when he knew what was coming—the end. But he couldn't stop the words from coming out of his mouth. ""It's not your fault, don't you dare blame yourself,"" he said.
She stared at him and nodded slowly. Then she hugged him and said, ""I know."" But he could see that she was struggling, and it tore him apart inside. He tried to comfort her, but she pushed away from him, and walked into the bedroom and closed the door behind her.
He was stunned by the turn of events, but there was nothing he could do about it, so he left her alone in the room until she emerged, hours later.
He saw right away that she looked different, different somehow... more mature, more beautiful than she'd ever been before. That night, after they had made love again, he thought that maybe she was just growing up and she would soon be leaving him. It would be her decision to go or stay. But now he didn't know how to react when she came out of the bathroom and climbed into bed with him, to let her know that he loved her, and would always love her.
And even though he told her this, he realized that it might not be enough. That maybe he needed to show her, in ways that would make her understand that he wanted her, that he wanted her forever...
He started touching her. He touched her arms and shoulders as she slept, and then, when she woke up, he took the opportunity to touch her more.",1279,0.21504240772610286,1.1360846870282975,-0.04393288036324121,-0.516435727573096,0.004732118665086567
243,R_3Q30KGCS9spiga5,BAS_HF_7,High Fantasy,Basic Coherence,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is where we'll find them,"" said the captain as he led his men down the path leading toward the shore. ""They're probably holed up in one of those towers.""
As they approached, they could see that there were several buildings clustered around the base of each tower. They seemed to have been constructed hastily, without any real care put into their construction. Most of the windows had holes punched in them while others were boarded up entirely. Some of the walls had collapsed completely, leaving only piles of rubble behind.
""I don't know if I'd call this place 'hospitable',"" said Vaelin.
""It's not much better than a prison camp,"" agreed the captain. ""But you can't blame them for being wary after what happened here last night.""
Vaelin followed him as he walked among the ruins until they reached a building which appeared to have survived intact. He peered inside and saw a large room with wooden floors and walls made from stone blocks. There were no furnishings save for a few rickety tables and chairs scattered about and a fire pit in the center of the floor.
""Looks like someone's still living here,"" said the captain. ""We should get moving before they notice us.""
He led his men back outside and began walking toward the nearest tower. As they neared the structure, Vaelin heard voices coming from within.
""What do you think?"" asked a woman's voice.
""Not good,"" replied a man's. ""There's too many of them. We won't stand a chance against so many.""
""Then we need to move quickly,"" she said. ""If we don't leave now, we might never make it away from this place alive.""
""You're right,"" he conceded. ""Let's go.""
The door opened and four armed men stepped out onto the walkway. Two of them carried bows while the other two held spears. All four wore leather armor and carried short swords. They were also carrying packs stuffed with provisions.
""Who are you?"" demanded one of the archers.
""Just travelers passing through,"" said the captain. ""My name is Captain Alric. What's yours?""
""Sulcifer,"" said the man. ""And these are my friends. We've come looking for work.""
""Well, Sulcifer, looks like you found it,"" said the leader. ""Come inside, we'll talk business.""
Inside the building, Vaelin noticed a number of doors leading off the main hall. Each had a crude sign nailed to its surface. One read 'Food', another 'Bathroom' and yet another 'Bed'. He wondered how long it would take for the inhabitants of this place to realize that they needed to add a 'Death' option.
""So, what sort of work are you offering?"" asked Captain Alric.
""Anything you want,"" said Sulcifer. ""We're mercenaries, so we can fight if you need us to but we prefer not to unless absolutely necessary. We'll do whatever you ask us to. Just give me an opportunity to earn enough coin to buy passage home.""
""That's very generous of you,"" said Alric. ""But I'm afraid we can't pay you anything. This is a military operation, nothing more. You're going to be fighting alongside our troops.""
""Against who?"" asked Sulcifer. ""Is there a war going on? If so, I'd love to join in.""
Alric shook his head. ""No, we're just trying to keep order in the kingdom. The people here aren't happy with the way things are run, so we're going to teach them a lesson. That's all.""
""Sounds like fun,"" said Sulcifer. ""What's the plan?""
""We're going to attack the town,"" said Alric. ""Once we've done that, we'll march on the palace. Once we're inside, we'll burn the king and queen alive. After that, we'll round up the rest of the royal family and hang them from the castle walls.""
""How will we know where they are?"" asked Sulcifer.
""We'll send scouts ahead,"" said Alric. ""When we reach the gates, we'll set fire to the city. Anyone left in the streets will die. It's that simple.""
""Sounds easy enough,"" said Sulcifer. ""Do you have any weapons?""
""Aye,"" said Alric. ""We have plenty of swords and shields. And I suppose you can have a bow if you like.""
""I don't know if I can use a bow,"" said Sulcifer. ""I haven't used one since I was a boy.""
""Don't worry about that,"" said Alric. ""Just point it at the enemy and pull the string.""
""Fair enough,"" said Sulcifer. ""Lead the way then.""
""Right,"" said Alric. ""Follow me.""
""Are you sure about this?"" asked Vaelin. ""I thought you said you weren't planning to kill anyone.""
""I'm not,"" said Alric. ""We're just going to scare them a little. Besides, if we really wanted to kill everyone here, we wouldn't need to hire mercenaries. We could simply storm the place ourselves and slaughter every last person in the place.""
""You sound awfully certain about that,"" said Vaelin. ""Why would you risk your life and those of your men for something like this? Surely you could get more money doing legitimate work.""
""Because I believe in what I'm doing,"" said Alric. ""I don't know why you're asking me these questions, anyway. You're a monk, aren't you? I imagine you know all about the importance of justice and righteousness. So, tell me, brother, do you believe in killing innocent people for the sake of a cause you don't even understand?""
""I don't know,"" said Vaelin. ""I've never killed anyone myself.""
""That doesn't mean you can't,"" said Alric. ""All it takes is a single arrow to end someone's life. A single sword thrust to cut a man in half. Or a fist to smash a skull. The difference between you and me is that I choose not to do such things. But I don't judge you for it. I don't condemn you because you disagree with my beliefs.

244,R_3ebt1P06ZDyw1dW,ACE_HR_10,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The way she moved made every hair on his body stand up straight, from his scalp to the tips of his toes. He could barely breathe when she smiled at him.
He couldn't even speak. His tongue had turned to sandpaper. It took all of his strength not to run out of there, just to get away from that smile and those eyes. But he didn't leave. Instead, he stood by the door until she left. Then he went back inside and washed the taste of her off of himself with soap and water, then scrubbed again.
It wasn't until he heard the sound of her voice that he realized he hadn't been listening to what she said. Her accent was so thick it was almost unintelligible, but the words themselves were beautiful.
She told him she liked his eyes, that they were dark and deep, and he wanted to know how old she was because he thought maybe he could be the father of her child. When he asked if she would marry him, she laughed at him. ""You're too young,"" she said, ""and I'm too old.""
And then she left.
That night he dreamed about her. She came to him in a dream, and he followed her through a forest full of wild flowers. They walked along an endless road, hand-in-hand. At last they reached a castle surrounded by high walls and tall towers. In its shadow, he knew, lay a woman's heart, and he knew that it belonged to her. And he loved her, and she loved him.
In the morning, he woke up sweating and shaking, knowing that she was real. That she was waiting for him somewhere in this world. And he was afraid. Afraid that someday someone else would find her first.
But he was determined to stay here, and he did. For a year, he watched her, waited for her, tried to learn more about her. Then he began to work in the tavern. Slowly, slowly, he got closer to her.
At last she spoke to him, and he understood why she laughed at him. She was older than he had imagined. She was nearly twenty years older than he was. She told him she already had a husband and a family. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, and he meant it. He would have given anything to take her place as the wife of the innkeeper, to give up everything he owned, to live here forever. Anything except his name. He never told anyone who he really was.
""What are you doing?"" she whispered, and her breath smelled sweet and spicy. ""Don't do it, please don't do it.""
He stopped. Stared down into the fire, wondering if he should tell her, or if he shouldn't say anything at all. Finally, he answered softly, ""I've been thinking of giving myself another name.""
She looked up at him. There were tears in her eyes. ""Another name? Why?""
Because he was afraid, he thought. Because he knew he wouldn't ever be able to stop now, no matter what happened next. Because he would always love her.
She nodded. ""If you want me to call you something different, then you can choose whatever you want.""
He smiled at her. ""My mother called me Peter. Is that all right?""
Her lips twitched. ""Yes,"" she said finally, and he felt himself smiling, too.
Then he kissed her.
They spent their nights together, lying in each other's arms beneath the moonlight. They made love under the stars, on the soft grass between the rows of wheat. Sometimes she cried, and sometimes he did, but mostly they simply held each other.
Afterward, they would sit close to each other on the porch swing and talk. They talked about their dreams, their hopes, their fears, and she listened to him without interrupting. He learned things about her; she learned things about him. He told her stories about his life, and she told him stories about hers.
Sometimes, she brought him food and drink from the kitchen. Once, she gave him a cup of tea laced with brandy, and he drank it in one gulp. Then she kissed him, and he felt drunker still, and he lost control of himself completely.
Later, he slept in her bed. The sheets were cool against his bare skin, but he didn't mind. He was warm enough.
When he woke up the next day, he found her sitting beside his pillow. Her hair fell over his shoulder like a silken curtain.
""How long has it been since we met?"" she asked him. ""One month, two months, three months?""
""Four,"" he answered. ""Four months.""
She smiled sadly. ""Will you wait for me, Peter? Will you promise me that?""
He leaned forward and pressed his forehead against her cheek. ""I promise,"" he whispered.
And she smiled. ""Good,"" she said. Then she took his face in both hands and pulled his head down toward hers, and he opened his mouth and let her kiss him.
For a while after that, he forgot all about the future, or at least, he pretended not to think about it. But soon he realized that he couldn't ignore the fact that she would die one day, and he wondered what he would do then. Would he go back to the city and start all over again? Or would he try to find someone new? Someone younger, with fewer wrinkles?
And then he remembered what she had told him before, about having a son. He decided he couldn't just forget about that, either.
So he left the village. He rode his horse out of the valley and away from her, back toward the town where he'd grown up. On his way there, he found a boy tending sheep and told him that he needed to borrow his horse. The boy was surprised to see him, but he agreed.
Peter rode the horse into the city. It wasn't hard to find the inn where his parents lived, but when he arrived, he saw that his father wasn't there. His mother greeted him with a hug. ""Where have you been, my darling?"" she asked him. ""We worried about you. You haven't come home in so very long. What's wrong? Are you well?""
He sat down and told her what had happened. About the woman he loved, and how he had promised to be with her. How he had lied to her, and he told her that it was his fault.
His mother shook her head. ""Oh, my poor boy. I'm so sorry. But you know what? This is exactly what she wanted. She wanted you to be brave, to be strong. To be a man, not a child. Now that you're here, she'll be happy. She will be at peace.",1168,0.16125240808071378,0.0745772926243303,-0.621284799650226,-0.5964803911223204,-0.5130661358698968

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The President had sent us a letter inviting us all to a meeting today, which was unusual. We'd never received anything like that before; he usually just called or texted. But there was something about the way the letter was written, with its formal tone and lack of any signature, that made me think he wanted to talk to us about something important. And since I had been spending most of my time working with Professor D'Agosta to find a cure for the disease, I didn't really know what else the president would want to talk to me about.
My mind was still racing as I walked down the street toward the university buildings where the labs were located. The idea that the president might be able to give us some insight into the virus that had been infecting our people left me excited but also anxious. What if they couldn't help?
It only took fifteen minutes for me to get to the campus and walk up to the administration building where I worked. As soon as I entered, I went straight to the secretary's desk and handed her the note. She smiled politely and put the letter away before telling me that Dr. Sato was waiting for me outside the president's office.
As soon as she said it, I felt my heart begin to pound again. The last thing I needed right now was to run into Dr. D'Agosta in front of the president. There was no doubt that he had noticed how much time I had been spending with him lately, especially because he knew about my condition. If I showed up for this meeting looking flustered and upset, then I would definitely look guilty. And I wasn't ready yet to tell anyone about what I had discovered.
I quickly headed back through the doors leading into the main hallway of the building. I passed several offices until I got to the one belonging to Dr. Sato. When I opened the door and stepped inside, I saw her sitting behind the desk, reading through paperwork. She looked up when she heard me come in and gave me a small smile. Then she pointed to the chair across from her desk so that I could take a seat.
""You've met President Ellis?"" she asked me.
I nodded and sat down. ""Yes, once before.""
Dr. Sato turned to face me fully while continuing to read whatever it was that she was looking at. ""So, you're going to meet him again today?""
I shook my head. ""No. Not exactly.""
She raised her eyebrows and looked surprised. ""What do you mean by 'not exactly?'""
I hesitated before answering. ""Well . . ."" I began, ""President Ellis is sick.""
Her expression immediately changed, and she stood up and came around to sit next to me. ""What?""
I shrugged. ""It's not good news, unfortunately.""
Dr. Sato's eyes filled with tears, and she covered her mouth with her hand to stop herself from crying. She turned to stare off into space as if trying to make sense of what I had just told her. After a few moments, she pulled out a tissue and dabbed at her eyes.
When she finally spoke again, she seemed more composed than I had ever seen her. ""Is he dying?"" she asked quietly.
""Not necessarily."" I tried to keep my voice even and calm. ""But I'm afraid he has cancer, and it's advanced.""
""Cancer?"" Dr. Sato repeated, her voice shaking slightly.
I nodded. ""I don't know the exact details, but I believe it's lymphoma.""
""Lymphoma!"" she cried out. ""That's terrible! Why did he wait so long to let us know about this?!""
I sighed. ""We haven't known about it for very long either. Only for about two months.""
Dr. Sato stared at me. ""Two months? How can that possibly be possible? I thought he was healthy. He looks fit enough.""
""He does,"" I agreed. ""But that doesn't change the fact that he has cancer. In addition, the cancer is progressing quickly, which means that there isn't much time.""
Dr. Sato started crying again. ""How can you say that?"" she wailed. ""There must be something we can do. Surely we can find a cure.""
I reached over to squeeze her shoulder comfortingly. ""I wish it were that easy.""
""But why didn't he tell us sooner?"" she insisted. ""Why did he hide this from us? Wasn't that part of his job? To protect us and keep us informed?""
""Perhaps it was,"" I answered carefully. ""But sometimes people are scared to tell others about things like this, for fear of being judged or misunderstood. You know what kind of stigma cancer carries with it. And even though he knows he wouldn't be judged or misunderstood, I think he may have felt too ashamed to share this with everyone else. That's just my guess, though.""
""Shameful!"" she exclaimed angrily. ""If he's dying, then that makes him human, doesn't it? We should all feel sorry for him, shouldn't we?""
I nodded slowly. ""Of course we should. But there's nothing wrong with feeling sad about his illness. It's natural to grieve for someone who is going to die. And that includes President Ellis, despite his position in society. Everyone wants to live forever, but that's impossible. We all eventually lose our lives.""
Dr. Sato shook her head sadly. ""No, that's not true. Some people have been granted immortality, thanks to the technology we've developed here on Mars. They can live forever, just like in Star Trek. But that won't happen for President Ellis, will it?""
I hesitated before speaking. ""Maybe. Or maybe there's a chance that the disease can be cured. Maybe he'll be able to survive this. We just don't know. And I think that's what bothers him the most. I think he feels as if he's letting us down. As if he failed us as the leader of the colony. And that's why he hasn't shared this with us. So that we don't feel bad about ourselves.""
Dr. Sato wiped her tears away with another tissue. ""And what about our people?"" she demanded. ""Are they going to be okay without their president?""
I leaned forward to rest my elbows on my knees. ""I honestly don't know. I hope so. But I'm also worried about the effect that losing him might have on the morale of the colony. If there's one person who inspires our people to fight hard and to persevere, then that person needs to be alive. If he dies, I'm sure there will be many people who will become depressed and lose hope. And if that happens, I think the whole colony will suffer as a result. And then everything we've built here could collapse.""
Dr. Sato nodded. ""So what should we do now?""",1195,0.18489507154133158,1.1838712077416893,-0.4583101587229072,-0.218119119671597,-1.0373704946425237
246,R_31oOtFNF12d6noR,ACE_HOR_8,Horror,Ace of Spade,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my own face though; this one had red eyes with black rings around them. Its lips were pulled back in what looked like a grin. I tried to scream but no sound came out. The thing smiled at me then opened its mouth wide revealing sharp teeth that glistened in the light. Then it started moving towards me. I ran out of the room as fast as I could and locked myself inside the bathroom. As soon as I shut the door behind me, I began shaking uncontrollably. After about five minutes, I calmed down enough to open the door and peek outside. There was nothing there anymore so I decided to go back to bed. I didn't want to sleep because I knew that whatever had been in the mirror would be coming for me soon. I kept telling myself not to be afraid, but how do you not be when something is going to kill you? Eventually, I fell asleep only to wake up to another knock on the mirror. This time, the face that appeared in the mirror looked just like mine except it was green instead of brown. Once again, I screamed and ran into the bathroom. I locked myself inside and turned off the light. After sitting there for what felt like forever, I finally calmed down enough to leave the bathroom. When I went to check on the mirror, all I found was shattered glass.
It's been almost two weeks since the incident. My parents have been gone ever since they received an emergency phone call from work saying that they needed to take care of some things here in town. I know they're worried sick about me, but I'm still terrified to go outside. Every night I can feel someone watching me through the walls. Whenever I try to talk to anyone, they get weird or look away. I've tried talking to the police, but they won't even listen. They keep telling me it's probably just my imagination getting worse now that my parents aren't home. That scares me more than anything else. If I tell them about the mirror, maybe they'll believe me and send someone over to help me. But if I don't tell them... What am I supposed to do?
My name is Karen Johnson. I live alone with my mom in a small house in the woods. She has always told me stories about her childhood growing up in the old Victorian house we live in now. Her father built it before he passed away. He was a carpenter and worked very hard to build our family home. A few years ago, she moved us to a new neighborhood after we lost her dad. We lived next to a beautiful forest where the kids used to play. One day, the neighbor boy broke his arm falling off of the swing set in their backyard. His mother took him to the doctor and the doctors said that the break was bad. The boy ended up needing surgery and his parents couldn't afford it. My mom offered to pay for his operation and treatment, but the boy's mom refused. My mom called me crying and asking why I hadn't told her about the broken arm. I was embarrassed because I never did anything wrong. She insisted that I tell her what happened. So, I did.
The next day, the boy's mom knocked on my door and asked to speak with my mom. I remember walking to the front door feeling scared and confused. My mom answered and I saw the look in her eyes. She was frightened and angry at once. ""What are you doing here?"" she demanded.
""Mrs. Johnson, I'm so sorry,"" the woman apologized. ""My husband is the one who should apologize to you.""
My mom turned around and stared at the woman. ""Excuse me?"" she questioned.
""Your son, Mr. Johnson's son, broke his arm playing on your son's swing set last week. My husband said he was too busy to fix it himself so he paid me to fix it for him. I fixed it and left the bill on your kitchen table. Your husband must have forgotten to pick it up."" Mrs. Johnson explained.
My mom thanked her profusely and gave her money to cover the cost. Afterward, the lady told us that her husband was working overtime and wouldn't be able to make it home for dinner. ""Would you mind keeping an eye on my little girl while I wait for her daddy?"" she asked. My mom agreed and took the little girl inside. When we got to her house, we sat down on the couch to watch TV. Suddenly, she got a text message and walked into the kitchen. While she was gone, I noticed that the little girl's hand was covered in blood. When my mom came back, the little girl's mother was standing there waiting for her. ""Thank you for watching my daughter Karen. I hope you enjoyed yourself,"" she said.
My mom nodded and then closed the door behind her. I didn't see either of them again until the following morning. I woke up to find a note on the coffee table from the little girl's mother. It read, 'Dear Karen, thank you for taking such good care of my little angel yesterday. I owe you one. Sincerely, Mrs. Johnson.' I smiled at the note and put it under my pillow. I thought it was nice that she wrote me a thank you card. After that, whenever my mom would ask me to babysit for the little girl, I would agree without hesitation. It became a routine for us. I would spend most of my days playing with her. On weekends, we would bake cookies together or go outside to feed the ducks in the pond.
One weekend, I woke up early and made breakfast for both of us. We ate in the dining room and then played until lunch time. Afterwards, we washed dishes together in the kitchen. I loved spending time with her; she was the sweetest child I'd ever met. Then one afternoon, I heard screaming coming from upstairs. I ran to the stairs to see the little girl running out of the living room carrying something in her arms. I followed behind her as I called out for her. ""Hey! Where are you going? What are you doing?"" I asked.
She didn't answer and continued running towards the staircase. I watched as she disappeared around the corner. I ran to the top of the steps and peered down. There, lying in the middle of the hallway, was the little girl. I ran down to her side and checked her pulse. I couldn't find one. I looked around the hall to see what had happened. There were two large pools of blood that had soaked into the carpet. I looked back towards the bedroom to see the little girl's body laid out on the floor. I ran back to the doorway and knelt down beside the dead body.",1230,-1.5962230714939594,-0.630792824274212,0.9923146662620722,-0.008286873244478611,-0.2898871478229664
247,R_wYTWvPlSRyCDJiV,ALL_HOR_1,Horror,All-Nighter,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was one I hadn't seen before. He had bright green eyes, black hair, and an ugly scar that ran across his right cheek. His mouth was wide open, as if he were screaming.
I turned my head to the side and saw another face in the mirror. This one had the same scar as the first man. It also had the same wide-open mouth, but this one seemed more excited than the other guy. His eyes were sparkling, almost like a cat's. He looked at me and smiled with perfect white teeth. Then he laughed so hard he had to wipe tears away from his eyes.
The two faces stared at each other for a moment before the first one disappeared. I heard the second man laughing as well and then I felt him crawling under my sheets. He pulled them off of me and threw them on the floor. He then grabbed me by the shoulders and pushed me down onto my knees.
I was terrified, not knowing what was going to happen next. The man crawled out from under the bed and stood up. He looked me straight in the eye and said, ""Don't be afraid.""
""Who are you?"" I asked.
He didn't answer. Instead, he reached out his hand and took mine. Then he led me through the mirror.
When I got to the other side, I found myself in a large bedroom with a king sized bed and a beautiful, four-poster canopy. A huge chandelier hung in the center of the ceiling above the bed and was covered with candles. There was another man sitting in a chair near the fireplace, reading a book. He looked up when he heard me enter the room.
""Well, look who's here,"" he said.
The man I had just met walked over to the other man and shook his hand. They both seemed to know each other very well.
""This is my brother,"" the first man said. ""We call him Jack.""
""Jack, this is my friend,"" the second man said. ""His name is Ben.""
They both looked at me and smiled.
""What's your name, young man?"" Jack asked.
""Ben.""
""My brother and I were hoping that you'd help us out. We need your help.""
""Why do you need my help?"" I asked.
""We want to find someone that we lost many years ago,"" Jack said.
""And who is this person?"" I asked.
""Her name is Anna,"" the first man said. ""She's my wife.""
""How long has it been since you've seen her?"" I asked.
""It's been a while now,"" Jack said. ""But we haven't given up hope that she'll return to us someday.""
""I think I can help you out,"" I said.
""How?"" Jack asked.
""There are things in this world that don't belong here,"" I said. ""They're not from our dimension and they come from another place.""
""That's right,"" Jack said. ""We've been looking for them ever since we lost Anna.""
""I'm sorry about your wife,"" I said. ""But I don't understand what you're getting at.""
""Ben, why don't you show him?"" Jack suggested. ""He's probably more qualified than anyone else on this earth to help us find what we need.""
""Okay, sure,"" I said. ""But where should we start? There are so many places in the world to search.""
""You're right, Ben,"" Jack said. ""There are millions of places that we could look.""
""Well then, why don't we narrow it down a little bit,"" I said. ""Why don't you tell me what kind of place you think Anna is?""
""Do you have any idea?"" Jack asked.
""I guess I don't know her well enough yet,"" I replied.
""How about the forest?"" Jack said. ""That seems like a good place to start.""
""The forest?"" I asked. ""Have you been there?""
""Yes,"" he replied. ""And I've seen many others like it. We found one near a town called New York, and another near the beach.""
""I haven't been to either of those places,"" I said. ""But I've never heard of any forests near either of those areas. And if they existed, I'm sure someone would have told me about them.""
""I agree,"" Jack said. ""So why don't we try to find one here in Texas.""
""Let's go to Texas,"" I said. ""It might be easier to find what we're looking for in a big place.""
Jack and his brother both smiled. Then Jack looked at me and said, ""If you'll come with us, I think we can help you find what you're looking for. And I think we can help you find what you're looking for as well.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""I'm ready whenever you are.""
""Great,"" he said. ""We'll leave right now.""
""But what about my house?"" I asked.
""Don't worry about your house,"" Jack said. ""We'll make sure everything is fine before we go. We won't leave until you say goodbye.""
I got out of bed and put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. The two men came into the room and stood next to each other. They both seemed happy that I agreed to go with them. Then they took my hand and led me out of the bedroom. We went downstairs and I saw my parents sitting at the kitchen table eating breakfast.
""Hi, Mom,"" I said.
""Good morning, Ben,"" she replied.
""Ben, I hope you don't mind if I ask you to go on a little trip today,"" my father said.
""No problem,"" I said. ""Just give me a couple of days to get packed up and I'll be gone.""
""That would be great,"" he said. ""I was hoping you'd come visit your sister and her family soon. Maybe you could bring some friends along this time.""
""I'd love to,"" I said. ""Maybe next month.""
""I'm looking forward to it,"" he replied.
""We'll call you when we get there,"" Jack said. ""And we'll call you every day.""
""Sounds good,"" my dad said. ""Have fun.""
""We will,"" Jack said. ""And we'll be back soon.""
Jack and his brother walked over to me and gave me a hug. They were both taller than me and looked strong enough to take down an elephant. After they left, my mother came over and kissed me on the forehead.

248,R_YbswhzxV54xdod3,BAS_HSF_2,Hard Sci-Fi,Basic Coherence,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The air felt warm against my face as I walked down the street toward the presidential palace.
The streets were empty except for a few people going about their daily business. I saw one old woman pushing a cart filled with vegetables, another man carrying two large bags of grain across his shoulders, and a young couple holding hands while they walked past me. As I passed them, I could see the girl looking up at me curiously. She had dark brown skin like mine but wore a white dress with purple trim. Her hair was braided tightly around her head, and she looked familiar somehow...
A flash of memory came back to me then. When I'd first arrived on Mars, I'd been taken to a small village where I met a girl just like her. We had talked together for hours until we finally went our separate ways. But what had happened between us? Had she left me or did I leave her? And why hadn't I thought about her since then?
My thoughts drifted away from the girl as I neared the palace. I didn't want to think about her anymore. Instead, I focused on the meeting I would be having later today with President Fisk. He wanted to discuss the possibility of establishing a permanent colony on Mars. At first, I'd been excited by the idea, but now I wasn't so sure. My mind kept returning to the girl from my memories. What if she really was important to me? If I agreed to help build a new colony on Mars, how long would I have to stay there before I could return home again? Would I even want to go back after all these years?
As I approached the entrance to the palace, I noticed something odd. A large group of men wearing black uniforms were gathered outside the gates, talking among themselves. They seemed to be waiting for someone, but no one else was around. Curious, I stopped and watched them for a moment. One of them turned to look at me, and I recognized him immediately.
It was General Stearn!
I couldn't believe he was here. How had he found me? Why was he here? I stood there staring at him for several seconds before I realized that I should probably say something. So I cleared my throat nervously and called out, ""General?""
He turned around quickly and smiled when he saw me. ""Hello, Mr. Smith,"" he replied. ""What are you doing here?""
""Dr. Sato told me that the president wants to talk to me,"" I answered.
Stearn nodded. ""That's right. Come with me. We'll get you inside.""
We started walking toward the front gate, and I asked, ""How did you find me?""
""I've been following your progress ever since you landed on Mars,"" he explained. ""I'm impressed by everything you're accomplishing here. You must be very proud of yourself.""
I laughed. ""Well, I am. I guess I never really thought about it before, but I do feel pretty good about myself. I mean, I'm not exactly like other people. Not everyone can spend five hundred years on Mars without aging a bit!""
Stearn chuckled. ""Yes, I suppose you're right. But don't worry too much about it. Everyone ages differently on Mars anyway. Some of us age faster than others. Yours is just a little slower.""
""Oh, yeah? Well, I still haven't aged a day in all this time, and I don't plan on starting anytime soon!""
""Okay, okay,"" said Stearn. ""Let's drop the whole 'aging' thing. It doesn't matter. All that matters is that you're here. Now, let's get inside.""
Once we reached the gates, Stearn opened them for me. Inside, a soldier escorted me through the halls of the palace and into the president's office. I saw Dr. Sato sitting at a desk near the door, along with several other scientists and engineers who worked for the government. They all looked up as I entered and gave me polite smiles. I waved to them and sat down in the chair next to the president.
President Fisk looked tired and worried. His dark hair was thinning, and his face was wrinkled like an old man's. He had a long scar running across his forehead, which made him look more intimidating than he actually was. The general leaned forward and said, ""Mr. Smith, I have some bad news for you.""
""What kind of bad news?"" I asked.
Fisk sighed and said, ""There's been a terrorist attack on Earth. Several nuclear bombs have been detonated, and most of the population has been wiped out. There are only a few survivors, and they're all hiding underground somewhere. We've lost contact with the rest of the world.""
""What?!"" I gasped. ""But how could this happen? Who could possibly do such a thing?""
""We don't know yet,"" answered the general. ""All we know is that it was done by someone who knew how to use the technology we developed for our colony on Mars. Whoever it was, they managed to sneak onto Earth undetected and set off the nukes before anyone could stop them.""
""So, what does this mean for us?"" I asked. ""Are we safe here on Mars?""
""No, unfortunately not,"" replied the president. ""This means that we need to start preparing for the worst. I've already sent a message to the UN, and they're sending a team of scientists over to investigate the situation. Once they figure out who did it, we'll be ready to move on them and put an end to their evil plans once and for all.""
""Wait a minute,"" I interrupted. ""You said you'd sent a message to the UN? But I thought we weren't allowed to communicate with Earth anymore.""
The president frowned and shook his head. ""Not directly, no. But we can send messages to the UN through the Mars colony. That's how we got word of the attack in the first place. I figured we might as well take advantage of the fact that we're connected to Earth.""
""And what will the UN do?"" I asked.
Fisk shrugged. ""They won't be able to do anything until the investigation is complete. But I'm sure they'll come up with something. They always do.""
The president turned to me and asked, ""Do you have any ideas about how we should respond to this threat? Do you think we should prepare for war?""
""War?"" I repeated. ""With whom? I don't understand.""
""I'm sorry, Mr. Smith,"" said the president.",1147,0.6163554596090903,-1.4575501977855518,-0.5729526093910089,-0.5171499211125222,0.25494822460749605
249,R_b9KIgkIaPCdUsRr,GEN_HR_6,Historical Romance,Genesis,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He didn't know she could sing until she started to. It had been a good voice, soft but sweet with just a touch of wistfulness, and it seemed as if she were singing for herself rather than the crowd. When he realized that, though, he couldn't help but listen.
He looked up from wiping down the table he'd been cleaning when she left, only to find himself staring after her. The woman who had taken her seat hadn't really interested him before; now he thought about her all the time. Her name was Elenor, and she was beautiful in an odd way. His friends teased him mercilessly because of it. ""If you're going to make me look at your new girl, then I want something out of it,"" they said. And what did he get? Nothing! They never paid any attention to her!
It wasn't fair. He knew she was beautiful. She wore her long hair loose around her shoulders, and often her dark locks fell across her face so that it looked as if she was wearing a veil. There was no other color in her dress or jewelry—just black—and yet, somehow it suited her. But he didn't care how pretty she was. What mattered was that she sang beautifully.
When the tavern closed, he went home. He liked being alone. People would ask questions and try to make conversation with him at times, when he was working, and the answers he gave them irritated him. Now, though, he felt more relaxed. At least, until he opened the door to his room. Then he found her there, waiting for him.
""I've been waiting for you,"" she said softly.
She was standing by the bed, her back turned to him. As she spoke, she slowly rolled up the sleeves of her gown. The fine fabric was made of silk, and it shimmered in the candlelight. He stared at the hard muscles of her arms, wanting to reach out and stroke them. Instead, he stepped forward and took hold of her arm.
""What are you doing?"" he asked.
Her voice was low and husky, and it sent a thrill through him. ""Why don't you put down that crossbow and take off those clothes?""
She laughed, and he heard the sound in his ears. ""Oh, you'll be sorry,"" she said. ""You should have stayed away.""
He pulled her toward him. ""Don't play games with me,"" he said. ""I won't stand for it.""
She leaned against him, pressing her body tightly against his. Her breasts were warm against his chest, and he felt their softness. He lifted her from the ground and threw her onto the bed. She gasped as she landed, and he followed her down.
""I'm not playing any games,"" she whispered. Her hands stroked his chest, and he groaned as she moved even closer to him.
His trousers were still on, but he tore them open and slid his hand inside her dress. She moaned, and he pressed himself against her. He wanted to feel her wetness between them. He needed to feel it.
Elenor's hands pushed at his shoulders, trying to push him away. ""No,"" she said. ""Not here!""
But he would have none of it. He pushed her legs apart and thrust into her, hard.
""Stop!"" she cried out. ""We can't do this here! Not like this! You shouldn't even touch me!""
He pulled out of her and grabbed her hands. ""This is how we're going to do it,"" he said. ""And you're going to love it. Just you wait and see.""
He forced her to lie on the bed and covered her with a blanket. She was shaking, but she didn't try to escape. Her eyes were wide, and she breathed heavily.
""There now,"" he said. ""That wasn't so bad, was it?""
She shook her head.
He lay beside her. She was trembling, and he could hear her breathing. ""Are you scared?"" he asked.
She nodded.
He kissed her cheek. ""Then why don't you go to sleep?""
He felt her tense. She tried to move away, but he stopped her. ""I won't hurt you,"" he said. ""Trust me, I wouldn't dream of it.""
She closed her eyes. ""Please,"" she whispered. ""Let me rest.""
He held her close and waited until she slept. Only then did he let her go.
As soon as she woke, she dressed quickly and ran from the house. She didn't stop running until she reached the woods. There, she cried for hours.
After that, he watched her every night. He spent most of his days in the tavern, drinking and singing. Everyone said he was a fool, but he didn't care.
At first, he thought she might leave again. But then she began coming to the tavern each evening, and he knew she was staying. Her eyes were always wide with fear, and he knew she feared him. He didn't care. He didn't even know why he kept watching her. Was it to remind her of what he would do if she ever tried to run? If that was it, then he was right to keep his promise.
But then she smiled at him. He almost dropped the tray of ale he was carrying. For the first time since he'd met her, she actually seemed happy.
Elenor went to the tavern each day. She didn't talk to anyone, but she listened to the songs the men sang. Sometimes they would tell jokes about her, and she laughed along with them.
It was another three weeks before she dared speak to him. He was leaning on the bar, and she came up behind him. She spoke softly, and he couldn't understand what she was saying. But then she gripped his arm and squeezed. Her fingers were cold.
""What?"" he asked.
""They're gone!"" she said. ""My parents, they're dead!""
""I'm sorry,"" he replied.
""Where are they?"" she asked. ""Didn't you kill them?""
He shook his head. ""I told you I didn't hurt them. Why do you think that?""
""I don't know,"" she said. ""I guess I thought you were like them. Like him.""
""Who?"" he asked. ""Your husband?""
She nodded, and he sighed. ""He was a terrible man. He beat me, and threatened to kill my mother and father if I ever told them what he was doing.",1089,-0.9110623536672275,-0.003840910559002085,1.2767879013315544,0.7510058002730683,0.7099738063721318
250,R_3ExOoqg4pLjN5LZ,FAN_HR_5,Historical Romance,Fandango,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been standing behind the bar, wiping glasses and pouring them out. As she came in, he had to look down so he wouldn't make eye contact with her. His eyes fell on the top of her head and he couldn't take his gaze off her. When she looked up, he was horrified that he had seen her from such a close proximity.
She was beautiful. Even though he knew what she looked like, it took his breath away all over again. Her skin was like porcelain, her features delicate. She had long, thick lashes framing large dark eyes. But the most arresting thing about her was the color of her hair. A deep, rich brown, he'd never imagined hair could be that shade.
He watched her as she ordered food, and he became convinced that this must be a dream. No one could be that gorgeous. And then when she turned back to the counter to get some money from her purse, he realized for the first time exactly how short she was. Her legs went on forever, but her torso and arms weren't much bigger than his own.
But it was her voice he remembered most. It was low, smooth, and musical and it made him catch his breath. There wasn't an ounce of self-consciousness in her, not at all. She was just herself, right there in front of him, a real person who didn't think about looking good. In fact, she was probably the only woman he'd ever seen in his life—real women like himself, with all their flaws and imperfections—who seemed completely oblivious to her looks or what anyone thought of them.
When he'd first heard her say, ""I'll have a chicken sandwich with a side salad,"" what he'd been thinking was, Why would anyone want to eat here? If you wanted to eat food like that, you could go to any number of places where they served it. But her voice had drawn him in, and once he knew the truth about her, the more he saw how ordinary she was, the more drawn to her he'd become.
Her name, as it turned out, was Claire, and although she knew he worked at the bar, she didn't seem to have any idea who he was.
And maybe that's why he never thought of her as anything other than a customer. The reason he hadn't given her a second thought was because he'd never met a girl like her before, someone who didn't think about being beautiful, someone who didn't seem to care if she was pretty. He liked that.
That summer, Claire had spent many nights at the Black Dragon Tavern. Most of the time, she sat at one of the tables in front of the bar, reading, while her younger brother, Sean, drank beer after beer at his usual table. Sean was always telling jokes, but she never laughed. She just stared into her book and pretended not to listen to him. It was hard not to stare, though. He was handsome, his black hair falling to his shoulders, his dark blue eyes bright and amused. He was tall and strong, with broad shoulders and powerful hands that always seemed to reach out to help her.
Every night, at the end of her shift, Claire would stop by his table and ask him to walk her home. Usually, he did. One night as they walked through town and past the church, Sean told her about the new priest, Father McBride. He described him as funny and good-hearted, the kind of priest you'd want your kids to marry, and he asked Claire if she liked him.
""I don't know,"" she replied, looking up from her book. ""He seems nice.""
Sean grinned. ""I know you don't like the ones who are holy and righteous. You prefer the priests who drink too much and tell dirty jokes, right?""
Claire shook her head. ""I haven't met any of them yet. But I guess the priest who married us was one of those kinds. Or at least he was at first.""
Sean put his arm around her shoulder and smiled at her. ""Maybe so. But maybe you'll have better luck the next time.""
Claire looked out at the streetlights passing by them and said nothing. After a minute or two, Sean gave her an affectionate tug, pulling her toward his side. Then he kissed her cheek, and together they continued on their way.
Sean had never made a move on Claire like that, even in the eight months they'd been friends. She thought it was because he respected her independence.
As time passed, though, Claire began to wonder if the real reason he didn't make a move on her was because he liked her too much. For Claire, Sean was everything. He was sweet and gentle and protective. Whenever she was sad, he always took her mind off her troubles. When she was bored, he was always there to keep her company.
She'd always felt that way about him. He was so good to her, and she was afraid to lose him. So she told herself she wasn't in love with him. It was just friendship. That was enough, at least for now.
It was only later that Claire learned that Sean had fallen in love with her. By the time he confessed his feelings, however, it was already too late. She couldn't imagine that they would ever be together, and besides, she didn't think he meant it like that.
The first time they saw each other after that, it wasn't the same. The air around them had changed. They'd both been hurt and angry, and it showed on their faces. It was like they were strangers. Claire felt uncomfortable. She couldn't stop looking into his eyes and wondering, Is he still in love with me? What happened?
He didn't say anything, just picked up his glass and took a long gulp of scotch. She noticed it because she was trying to read his expression and it was hard to do from far across the room.
Then Sean set the glass down on the table and left the tavern without saying another word. Claire got up and followed him, and by the time they reached his table, he was gone. There was no explanation, no goodbye, no note. Just a quick exit and the realization that he was leaving for good. And so she stood by the tavern entrance alone, watching as Sean's car drove away.
In her heart, she knew she wouldn't see him again, that their friendship was over. But for a while, she wished she could forget the sound of his voice, forget the way he made her feel. She even went so far as to visit an herbalist in town and buy a bottle of something called Forget-Me-Now. But it didn't work. Every time she saw Sean, he was the first thing on her mind.
After Sean left, it was almost four years before Claire started coming back to live at the Black Dragon again. And every time she did, he was there. She thought about him sometimes, wondering what it would be like to have a friend like him. But she never tried to find out, not for four years.",1252,-0.8372722644438152,-0.2935065472172269,0.7684665841758819,0.15554043429571243,-1.2534962351914225
251,R_vZWXUG2JI991tcJ,ACE_HOR_7,Horror,Ace of Spade,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The eyes were like black holes that sucked in all light. It had no mouth or nose; instead, its skin was stretched tight over its skull, giving it an almost alien look. The hair was long, black and straight as a ruler. My reflection didn't move so much as twitch when I spoke but answered my question with one word. ""Come.""
""Who are you?""
It smiled and said nothing. Instead, it turned around and began walking away. I followed behind. There wasn't any furniture in this room except for a wooden chair and a small table next to it. On the table sat two glasses of water and a bottle of pills. As I took a seat in front of the mirror, he poured a glass of water for each of us before handing mine to me. He then put down the bottle and stood up, facing the other side of the mirror.
The only thing separating him from me was the thin piece of glass. I could feel his gaze burning into my soul while he slowly drank his own water. When he finished, he placed the glass on the table and picked up the pills. ""Take them,"" he said without looking back at me.
Without thinking twice about what I was doing, I grabbed the glass and downed half of the water. The pills were bitter tasting and burned going down. After I swallowed them, I felt a dull ache inside my stomach. ""Why do you want me here? What's your purpose?""
He didn't answer me immediately. Instead, he picked up the glass and stared at me through the mirror. His stare was intense, as if he was trying to see right through my very being. When I looked back at him, he finally spoke. ""You will be the last of the line. You must learn how to survive against the darkness within yourself.""
""How can you say that? I've been doing well since I started college. I haven't killed anyone lately, have I?""
His expression changed to one of sadness as he shook his head. ""No, but that doesn't matter. Your time has passed. Now, take the glass and drink the rest of the water.""
I did as I was told. This time, though, I held onto the glass after taking the last sip. He nodded at me as if approving my choice. ""Good. Now, let me show you something.""
When I turned to look at him, he was gone. In his place, another man stood. This one was tall and lean. His skin was dark brown and covered by thick, bushy eyebrows. His short-cropped hair was a dirty blond color and matched the stubble on his chin and cheeks. He wore a pair of loose pants made from some kind of animal hide. They fit loosely around his waist and showed off the muscles in his legs. A belt hung low across his hips, holding several knives and throwing stars. Overtop the shirt he wore, a leather vest covered most of his chest. Underneath, a black tunic hid everything else. Over the top of it, he wore a gray cape with gold trimmings. It seemed odd because there were no weapons attached to it.
As I studied the strange outfit, he spoke again. ""This is my brother, who is also my best friend. We're twins and our bond goes beyond blood. We've always worked together and we'll continue to do so.""
My heart skipped a beat at the sound of his voice. Even though I hadn't seen his face yet, I knew who he was. ""Is this...?""
The stranger chuckled as he looked down at himself. ""Yes, yes it is.""
""But how can that be? You're dead!""
He gave me a sly grin and laughed. ""And yet, I'm still alive. Don't worry, I won't bite. You don't know where they've taken me either. But trust me, you wouldn't want to meet these guys unless you absolutely had to. They're not exactly friendly.""
""Where are they keeping you?"" I asked.
""That depends. If I tell you, then you'll go after them, won't you?""
I hesitated for a moment, wondering whether it was worth the risk. ""Fine, I'll tell you. Just don't leave me hanging. Where are they?""
He pointed toward the door leading out of the room. ""There.""
""Thanks,"" I replied as I left the room and headed outside.
On the way to the exit, I saw a guard standing watch. When he caught sight of me, he ran forward and opened the door. Without even saying anything to me, he simply pushed me out of the room. As soon as the door closed behind me, the guard ran past me and went down the stairs. I followed him down, noticing the guard didn't carry any weapon. That worried me a little bit but I tried not to think too hard about it. Instead, I focused on getting to the bottom of things.
At the base of the stairs, I came upon a large stone building. The roof was flat and supported by a series of pillars. Each pillar was carved with intricate designs. Some of them depicted scenes of battle and others just showed nature. It reminded me of the temples I'd seen in pictures of Greece. The floor was paved with marble tiles, making the area look like an ancient Greek temple. Several people stood in front of the building, staring at the ground. I noticed a few of them had their hands tied behind their backs. One of the guards motioned for me to come over. I approached him, stopping a few feet away from him. He looked at me, nodding once before speaking.
""They've been here for a while. No one knows why, but the boss ordered us to bring them here. So far, none of them have been able to escape.""
""Who are they?"" I asked.
The guard shrugged. ""None of us know. All we know is that the boss wants them brought here. And the sooner, the better.""
""What happened to the ones that escaped?"" I asked.
The guard shook his head. ""Nothing. We found them hiding in the woods and took care of the problem. They weren't even hurt. It's probably best if you didn't ask questions, though. I doubt you'd want to hear the answers anyway.""
I wanted to ask more, but the guard continued talking.
""The boss will be coming down shortly. He likes to inspect the prisoners every now and then. He might decide to take one of the newbies home with him. I don't know what happens to the rest, though. I guess the boss takes care of that when he feels like it.",1167,-1.2082082718142142,2.3990112369211145,1.6445153073103325,0.5462071605963195,0.1357579577538936
252,R_2WVEm42gz1zKgVb,GEN_HOR_2,Horror,Genesis,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had long black hair with deep blue eyes.
""Hello,"" it said in an eerie voice like only I could hear. There were no words spoken by the person in the mirror. Only a strange voice that seemed to be coming from inside my head. ""My name is Anna.""
""Who are you?"" I asked her.
She smiled and answered, ""We'll get to know each other very well."" She then reached for my hand and held on tightly as she walked around behind me. A moment later, we were standing outside of my house as we watched the sun rise up over the horizon.
It was getting closer to Halloween when my parents decided that they wanted to take us camping one last time before school started again. They rented a big cabin in the mountains so we could have lots of privacy and not worry about people seeing us having sex. We all went out hiking so we could explore the area and enjoy nature while away from home.
""That's a beautiful view,"" my dad said pointing at a couple of trees nearby. He turned his head and looked at me. He always did that whenever he saw me staring off into space or daydreaming. I used to think it was cute how much he loved me but now I just find it annoying.
As we continued walking, we came across a lake hidden in the middle of the woods. It was surrounded by green grass and tall pines. All of a sudden, we heard screaming. When we looked back, the screams stopped. Then we saw someone running through the forest with their clothes torn apart.
""What is going on here?"" my mom cried out. We all stood there stunned by what we had just seen. As the man ran past us, we noticed that he was naked and bleeding. His arms and legs were ripped wide open. He kept falling down and stumbling as if he couldn't find any strength.
Then, as quick as it started, the man fell to the ground and died right in front of our eyes. Everyone stared at him and let out an audible gasp. My dad immediately dropped to his knees and began crying. The rest of us followed suit and we all started weeping loudly.
The man laid there motionless on the ground and he didn't move again. We all stayed there for a few minutes but soon realized that there was nothing we could do for him. We left him lying there in silence and returned to camp to pack up so we could leave early.
My parents walked over to where the body was laying. They knelt down beside him and put their hands over his bloody face. Then they kissed his forehead and whispered something to him. I couldn't hear them over the noise so I looked back at the others. I could see the fear in their eyes and I knew they were thinking the same thing I was; this was some sort of sick ritual.
After that, my parents packed up everything quickly and drove us home. When we arrived, we unpacked and cleaned up before doing anything else. It took a lot longer than usual because everyone was feeling depressed about what had happened. After dinner, my parents decided that we would all spend the night together in the cabin. I wasn't sure if this was a good idea, but they insisted so I agreed.
Once we finished eating, my brother and sister went out and played cards while my parents sat down on the couch. I sat across from them next to my mom as she started rubbing my back.
""I'm sorry,"" she said looking at me.
""For what?"" I asked.
""That man,"" she said. ""He was your father's best friend.""
I nodded my head and said, ""No matter who he was, he is still dead. Let's not talk about him anymore.""
My mom rubbed my back some more and tried to calm herself down. She didn't say another word until my dad cleared his throat.
""Are you okay?"" he asked.
She nodded her head and replied, ""Yes, thank you.""
My dad put his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Don't apologize. This has been very hard for all of us. You've done a fine job holding everything together.""
My mom smiled and thanked him for the compliment.
""You're very welcome,"" he said patting my mother's shoulder.
Then he looked back over at me and asked, ""How was your hike today?""
I shrugged my shoulders and responded, ""It was fun.""
My dad laughed and said, ""What? You weren't afraid to go out alone like that?""
I shook my head and said, ""Oh, no. I wasn't scared at all. Actually, it was kind of nice being away from the city and all the chaos. It made me feel better to be surrounded by nature once again.""
Everyone else joined in on the laughter and they all started talking about what they did during the day. Soon, my mom got up and went into the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator door and pulled out a gallon of milk. When she closed it, there was a loud thud. I jumped up and ran into the kitchen to see what happened.
""What was that?"" I asked her.
""Oh, that's just the door slamming shut,"" she replied. ""Sorry about that.""
Then she took the pitcher of milk out of the fridge and poured it all over the floor. She did the same thing with the butter. When she finished, she threw the empty containers at me and screamed, ""Now clean this mess up!""
I wiped my hands off on my jeans and went to grab some paper towels. Once I had some, I walked into the living room and handed them to her.
""Thanks,"" she said taking them.
She then wiped her hands off and turned towards me, ""I don't care if you went hiking or whatever. Just make sure that you stay close to us when we're out here. Understand?""
I nodded my head and said, ""Sure.""
She smiled at me and said, ""Good.""
Once everyone finished cleaning up, we all went to our rooms to get ready for bed. When I lay down, I felt something cold against my leg. It was the zipper of my sleeping bag. I looked down and noticed that my brother was trying to crawl inside. When I moved toward him, he yelled, ""Get away from me!""
I sat up and hugged him tight. ""Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you. Why don't you tell me what's wrong? I promise I won't judge you.""
He sniffled and said, ""I can't sleep because you keep kicking me.""
I kicked him back and said, ""I was trying to kick off the covers. What's the problem?""",1190,-1.2945481839245367,-0.5225570612051994,1.2482545933208433,0.2859726704437437,-0.9708157613632894

I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. I couldn't see his eyes, but I did see his teeth, which were all black.
""Who is there?"" I asked.
""You know who I am.""
""No, who are you?""
""I am the one who brought you here,"" he said.
""Why did you bring me here?""
""I needed to get the answer that I want from you.""
""What do you want?""
""Do you have a last name?""
""No.""
""Do you know where you are?""
""No.""
""Why not?""
""I was unconscious for a long time.""
I looked at the wall. ""I don't know how long.""
""You were unconscious for a very long time. You were in a coma for a very long time.""
""What does that mean? What happened to me?""
""You were in a car accident. You were in the hospital for a very long time as well.""
""A car accident? What kind of accident?""
""You don't remember? You don't remember anything? You don't remember who you are?""
""No, I don't remember anything,"" I said. ""I don't even know my last name.""
He smiled at me and then said, ""You have one. It is Rourke.""
""So that means I'm a Rourke?""
He nodded. ""Yes, you're a Rourke.""
""Oh,"" I said. ""I guess that's good, right?""
He nodded again. ""Yes, you're a Rourke and that is good. But do you remember what happened before the accident?""
I shook my head. ""No,"" I said. ""I'm not sure I want to remember what happened before the accident.""
He nodded again and then said, ""Maybe it would be best if you didn't remember what happened before the accident."" He looked at me and then smiled. ""Maybe it would be better if you didn't remember your last name either."" He then laughed, but it sounded like he was choking in his throat. ""Maybe it would be better if you didn't remember anything at all.""
He opened his mouth and all of his teeth turned at once, and he screamed at me. He screamed so loud that I couldn't believe it. It seemed like he was screaming for hours and hours. The more he screamed, the more scared I became. Then he stopped screaming and put his mouth to his mouth again and coughed out black smoke, which he started breathing in. Then he turned and walked out of the mirror and disappeared. I watched him walk out of the mirror and disappear into thin air.
I walked to my kitchen and made myself some tea. Then I went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet seat to take a shit. When I looked into the toilet bowl, there was a face looking back at me. The face had black teeth and black hair, just like the man in the mirror did, and he was smiling at me as well. When I looked into the mirror again, the face disappeared, but this time it did so much faster than it had before.
I walked out of the bathroom and went back into my bedroom where I sat down on my bed, still wearing my pajamas. I was still in shock from seeing both faces looking back at me in the mirror. Then something else came into my mind, something I had been thinking about for a while now. Something that had been bothering me for a long time now. Something about what happened earlier today when I had seen that man walking around my house in my pajamas and thinking he was me walking around my house in his pajamas. Something about what happened that made me think I was losing my mind again. Something about what happened that made me think I was going insane once more after having thought I was over it all this time since last year when the accident had happened to me.

254,R_6wWiBrkr8B45JrX,GEN_HOR_6,Horror,Genesis,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. My own, but not my face. The body had been cut in half with one arm dangling off the side of the mirror. It was bloodied and pale white. It smiled at me as if to say ""hello.""
""I'm dead,"" I said, and then I passed out.
When I awoke, I found myself sitting on the floor in front of the bathroom sink. Looking into the mirror now, I saw that it was just an ordinary mirror. There were no more people or monsters staring back at me. Instead, I saw a reflection of myself wearing black jeans and an old t-shirt. I stood up and brushed myself off before walking towards the door.
I opened it to see a man standing there. He was tall with dark hair, a goatee, and piercing green eyes. His shirt was torn open to reveal his bare chest. He grabbed my shoulder and spun me around. A second later, he was knocked unconscious by something falling onto him.
I turned around and saw another man lying on the ground. This time, he didn't look quite human. He was pale as a ghost with a sharp, angular jawline. One eye was covered in gauze while the other one was completely shut. He was clutching at his stomach and moaning in pain.
I ran over to him and pulled my phone out of my pocket. I pressed call button, but nothing happened. The screen remained blank. The man's breath was becoming more labored and his eyelids began fluttering. I panicked and tried to dial 911, but the same thing happened. I tried opening my browser and hitting refresh, but still nothing. Then, I remembered what the woman in the diner said about being in a place where the internet doesn't work.
I went over to the man who fell asleep and touched his wrist. He came to suddenly and clutched at the wound on his stomach. I took my car keys out of my pocket and gave them to him. He put them into his mouth and started chewing on them. Then, he pointed behind me and made a strange noise. I turned around to find two more men standing in the doorway. They were both holding guns and looked very angry.
""You want some too?"" I asked.
The man with the bandaged eye let out a loud scream and pointed his gun right at me. I stepped away from the man and raised my hands. The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye did the same.
""What is going on here?"" I asked.
""Who are you?"" one of the men replied.
""I'm a friend of the lady you guys attacked in the diner.""
""Just stay down for a minute and we'll get answers out of you,"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said.
""Okay,"" I said.
He pointed his gun at me and pushed me backwards against the wall. I didn't fight back. I just waited for whatever they wanted to do. The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye reached into his pocket and pulled out a small knife. He quickly sliced through the rope that was tying my wrists together. I rubbed my wrists where the ropes had dug into them so deeply.
""Why would they attack her?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye asked.
""I don't know,"" I answered. ""But I think she has some sort of connection to what's happening around here. She seemed surprised when I told her about my brother. That's why we were there.""
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye held up his hand and made a fist. A moment later, I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder. Then, I felt my neck being twisted as hard as I could stand.
""What the hell?"" I screamed.
I tried to turn around, but the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye pushed me back against the wall. He leaned down and placed his ear next to my mouth.
""Not so loud,"" he whispered.
I nodded and he released me. I turned around to see the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye pointing his gun at me again.
""I don't have any answers,"" I said. ""I haven't seen anything like this before either. I can't help you.""
""There's a room upstairs,"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said. ""We'll take care of things there.""
I looked up to see two more men coming up the stairs. They were dressed in black suits and carried large guns in their hands.
""Do what you need to do,"" I said.
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye reached into his pocket once again and took out a small bottle. He unscrewed the lid and sprayed some liquid on my face. Then, he picked up the man who was tied up in the corner and threw him at the wall. The man bounced off the wall and slid to the floor. He groaned in pain as he tried to get up.
The man with the gauze wrapped around his eye dropped the empty bottle and pulled out a small syringe. He jabbed it into the man's stomach and then injected something into his veins. The man's skin became red and blotchy and he began bleeding from his nose.
""So, what's your name?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye asked.
""I'm Michael,"" I said.
""Michael, huh?"" the man with the gauze wrapped around his eye said. ""Well, Michael, I guess you're our prisoner for now. We'll be back to talk to you soon enough.""
They all left the room and closed the door behind themselves. I ran over to the fallen man and saw that he was shaking. I helped him up and led him into the bathroom. I washed his face and cleaned the blood from his arms and chest. Then, I sat him down on the toilet and gave him water to drink. After he finished drinking, I wiped his lips clean and removed the gauze wrapped around his eye. It was red and swollen. I pressed my fingers against the wound and he cried out in pain.
""It hurts,"" he said.
""Sorry,"" I said. ""Let me see what I can do to help you.""
I carefully removed the bandage and saw that the skin underneath was very raw and inflamed. The area around the wound had turned bright purple. There was also a large lump sticking out of his cheek.
""Oh, God,"" I said. ""Are you okay?""
""I'll be fine,"" he said. ""It will heal eventually.""
I sat down next to him and rubbed his back. He closed his eyes and sighed.
""I hate needles,"" he said. ""That was the worst pain I've ever felt.""
""I'm sorry,"" I said.
He chuckled and leaned his head on my shoulder.",1199,-1.102407166287414,-0.9278897436015465,0.3941665768066699,0.5576548061873001,-1.1967245069483232
255,R_1Lu583PGwO1tpm2,MOR_HOR_7,Horror,Morpho,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was my own, but the face was distorted and looked haunted.
I screamed and fell backwards into the bed, knocking the bed frame over. I could hear the headboard banging against the wall. I thought I heard a few voices, but I couldn't make out what they were saying.
I sat up and reached out to touch the mirror, but stopped when I felt something on my hand. It was a small spider, just like the ones that had been in my room before. This one was the size of a dime and I screamed again. I pulled my hand away from the mirror and the spider crawled up my arm. It seemed to be crawling up my arm and into my body because it felt like it was crawling inside me. I screamed at the top of my lungs and then fell back onto the bed, unable to move.
As I lay there on the bed, screaming and crying, I could hear a voice. It sounded like my mother's voice, but it wasn't her voice. It was a deeper voice and it scared me further. The voice said, ""Come here little girl, come here."" Before I could say anything else, the voice grabbed me and pulled me out of bed.
The next thing I knew, I was lying on the floor and someone was walking around in my house. The next thing I knew, I was lying in a ditch next to a field with a few other people, all looking down at me. They were all dressed like the woman who had woken me up in the first place. They had their hands pressed against their heads and they were screaming at me to help them.
I heard someone say that they were going to kill me next and then they would all die.
""Help them,"" I begged them. ""Please help them.""
""You're next,"" they said to me. ""They're coming for you next.""
""Help them,"" I begged them again. ""Please help them!""
Then, just as quickly as it came, the voices and everything faded away and I could move again.
I opened my eyes and saw my mother standing over me with a shotgun in her hand. She yelled at me to get up off the floor and put on some clothes. She told me to call 911 and tell them someone had broken into our house and started to kill everyone in it.
""What happened?"" I asked my mother, still not understanding what had happened or why she woke me up so early in the morning.
""Someone broke into our house,"" she said to me as she stared at me with a stunned look on her face. ""I got up to check on you and I found you on the floor with blood all over you.""
""Wh-who did this?"" I asked her, still in a daze as I tried to remember what happened last night to cause all of this.
""I don't know,"" she said as she stared at me with a terrified expression on her face. ""I don't even know what happened.""
The police came out to our house and took our statements while they searched through everything looking for clues as to what might have happened last night. The police asked us if we had seen anything out of place or if we knew who might have broken into our house last night. We didn't have any idea who would have done this or why they would do this to us. My mother was an early riser so maybe whoever did this came into our house while we were asleep and tried to kill us all, but we had no idea why they would have done such a thing or why they would have killed some of us but not all of us. We just didn't know who had done this or why they would have done such a thing. We just didn't know anything about it and we didn't know anything about how it had happened either because we were all still in shock from what had happened last night that everything felt like a dream that we were trying to wake up from, but none of us could remember what had caused us to wake up on our own in the middle of the night with blood all over us. The police left after taking our statements and giving us contact information for a detective who would be in contact with us soon. My mother called her parents and told them what had happened just in case something else happened while we were alone at home so they could come get us if needed.
The next morning they came by to pick us up while my mother stayed behind to clean up some of the blood that had splattered when we were all attacked by some unknown assailant last night. We drove back over there with them so they could help us clean up some of the blood that was still on our clothes without getting blood stains on our cars too. We went back home after that and stayed home all day long while we waited for our detective to contact us about what had happened last night so we could try to figure out if someone wanted to hurt us or if someone wanted to harm us or if someone wanted us dead or if someone wanted us alive but wanted us dead too or if someone wanted us dead just because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us alive just because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us alive because they wanted us dead or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us dead because they wanted us alive or if someone wanted us to live or die or die or live or die or live or die or die die or die or live or die or live or die or live or die or die but not live forever but live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by living now by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so that we can live forever by dying now so

256,R_2zw5a12cw7yro2Z,ACE_HR_5,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He could feel his cheeks redden with embarrassment as he tried to hide himself behind a newspaper, but she had seen him, and she looked directly at him with an expression that said she knew exactly who he was. It was almost more than he could bear, having someone else know what he was doing, and so he rose from his chair and walked away without saying anything. But he couldn't help looking back over his shoulder to see if she would follow him. And she did.
He never went near the bar again after that day—he couldn't bear it if he ran into her there. The only way he could be sure not to run into her was by going home every night early and staying up late reading books on history, which wasn't all that exciting for him anyway. So when she came into the shop he owned, he hid behind a bookcase, pretending to read. When she left, he pretended he didn't know who she was, even though everyone in the town knew. That made things easier, since no one would bother him then.
It's funny how you can get used to something, especially when it's the thing you want most. After a while, seeing her around the town became normal enough that he stopped thinking about her as much. Until one evening when he was walking home through the woods and he heard her voice calling out to him from somewhere nearby. ""William!"" she cried out.
He turned to look at her and found her standing just beyond the trees, smiling at him. He smiled back, relieved to find her alive. But when she reached out to touch his cheek, he felt something sharp beneath her fingertips. He flinched involuntarily, pulling away from her touch, but she took hold of his hand instead and pulled him closer until their bodies were pressed together. He could feel her warmth against his own and wondered if this meant they were friends now. Then she kissed him, hard, and he realized they weren't. They weren't anything except strangers who happened to live in the same place.
""I have to go,"" she told him. ""But I'll see you tomorrow.""
And she disappeared before he could ask her why.
That was two weeks ago, and he hadn't seen her since then. Every day, he would walk down to the river and look for her, but each time she was nowhere to be found. Sometimes, he thought he caught a glimpse of her reflection in the water, but always when he moved towards it, she disappeared. He kept hoping she might show up, or that maybe she had gone somewhere else. But today he decided he wouldn't wait anymore. Today he was going to talk to her.
As William stepped onto the path that led to the river, he felt a chill fall over him. He shivered and glanced around, trying to figure out what was wrong, but the sun shone brightly overhead and there wasn't any wind blowing. Wasn't there? Something was different...
Ahead, he saw her sitting on the ground beside the river, staring into the water, her head bent low, as if she were listening to the sound of its flow. For some reason, she seemed to be crying. Or maybe that was just wishful thinking on his part. He couldn't tell whether she was male or female, although he suspected she must be female because he knew he was a man. Maybe he was mistaken about that too, since he couldn't really see very well. All he could make out was a dark outline, like a shadow. He stood still, watching her, wondering what she was doing there and why she was crying. As he watched her, he began to wonder if perhaps he should leave.
Maybe he shouldn't have come here after all. If she wanted to be alone, maybe he should let her be alone. But he was curious, so he started toward her, intending to say hello. He didn't intend to startle her, but he certainly hoped she didn't mind that he was approaching. Perhaps she'd be glad to see someone else.
When he got close enough, he saw that she had her hands buried deep inside the pocket of her skirt. Her head was bowed, and her shoulders shook slightly as she sobbed quietly to herself.
He frowned, feeling sorry for her. He wondered if he should call out to her, or maybe offer to give her a hug, but she looked so sad, so lost, he hesitated to do either of those things. Instead, he sat down next to her, resting his arm along the back of her seat. His hand closed around hers, and she jerked away, turning her face away.
She sniffed loudly and wiped her eyes with her sleeve, smearing mud across her cheeks. When she spoke, her words were muffled by her lips, making them sound like slurred whispers. ""What are you doing?""
He frowned, puzzled. What was he supposed to do? ""Doing what?"" he asked. ""Why did you cry?""
Her reply surprised him. ""You don't understand."" She sounded angry, hurt, bitter. ""My mother died last week.""
His heart went out to her. How terrible! ""Oh,"" he said softly. ""How did she die?""
""The plague,"" she replied. ""They think she probably picked it up from the rats that infest the sewers under the city. It's spreading fast, and there's nothing we can do to stop it.""
He nodded sympathetically. ""Yes, that does seem bad.""
She looked up at him, and for a moment he thought he saw something familiar in her eyes, like recognition, but then she turned away and stared off into the distance once more.
""Did you ever lose someone?"" he asked. ""Someone you loved?""
She didn't answer right away, but after a few moments she said, ""No. No one I've ever loved has died.""
He wished he knew what to say, how to comfort her, but he didn't. There was nothing he could possibly say that would ease her pain, and so he simply waited for her to finish. When she finally did, he tried to put himself in her shoes and imagine what he would feel like if he were in her situation. He thought about how he would feel if he'd been the one who had lost someone. He imagined that he would be devastated, that he would want to scream and shout and rage against the unfairness of it all. And that's exactly what she did.
She screamed and shouted and ranted and raved, and William tried to calm her, to reassure her, to explain that there was nothing anyone could do. But he knew he was only saying the same thing over again, and that it didn't matter, not to her. Not to anyone. And he knew that he couldn't help her, that there was no way for him to ease her suffering, even though he wished desperately that there was.
Finally, she fell silent and lay back against the ground. She pulled her knees up against her chest and wrapped her arms around them. ""It doesn't matter,"" she murmured, as if talking to herself. ""I'm not important. I never was.""
""Who said that?"" he asked gently.
""I did.""
He shook his head in disbelief. ""Why would you say such a thing?""",1266,0.6366841668152229,2.2943320181507048,0.7954130530512573,0.7720651587901599,0.7873355649006629
257,R_3NKH5um7tC4RupW,ALL_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
As I walked down the sidewalk toward the center of town, I pulled up the message on my wrist computer and started to read it. It was a short message, but it gave me pause. The president was requesting our presence? This had never happened before. He usually just sent a note.
When I arrived at the building where I'd been living for the past two years, I walked into the lobby and waited as a young woman in a white lab coat handed me a visitor badge. I checked in at the front desk, and then went down a long hallway lined with offices until I came to one marked ""President's Office."" I stepped inside, and there sat President Kuklo, waiting for me.
""You're early,"" he said with a smile as I stepped inside his office. ""We were hoping you would come."" He gestured for me to sit in the chair across from him, so I did.
""Thank you for inviting us to your office today,"" I said as I took off my helmet and placed it on the floor next to me. The room was cool, but not uncomfortably cold like some of the buildings back on Earth. The air recyclers were efficient here, and the atmosphere was breathable.
The president nodded and smiled again. ""Thank you for coming, Doctor,"" he replied. ""I know you have a busy schedule, so I'll keep this brief. As I'm sure you've heard, we are having trouble with the colony's food supply. We haven't had any luck growing crops, and the soil is too thin to grow much of anything. Our food supplies are running out, and I need to get our agricultural team working on finding a solution.""
I was shocked by this news. The president hadn't mentioned that he was having any issues with the food supply. If he did, I must have missed it. ""What's your current ration status?"" I asked, trying to sound calm.
""Our rations last about three months, and we've used up half of them already,"" he answered. ""That means that if things don't improve soon, we won't be able to provide for our people for much longer. This is why I wanted to talk to you. I need you to help us find a way to solve this problem.""
My mind started racing. ""I'm afraid I don't have the experience you need for this,"" I told him honestly. ""I'm not trained in agriculture. You should ask Dr. Sato to come down here to Mars.""
""I know she's a scientist,"" President Kuklo said. ""But her job is to research how life originated on Earth, not to find a solution to a problem like this. And she's already working on something else at the moment. That's why I thought you might be a better person for the task.""
""You think I can do this?"" I asked him.
""Yes,"" he said with a nod. ""I have complete confidence in you.""
""Well,"" I said with a smile. ""That makes me feel better."" I paused for a few seconds before continuing. ""But let me tell you what I would need if I were going to help you out with this problem.""
""Go ahead,"" he said as he leaned back in his chair.
""First off, you need to send someone down to Earth to get some help,"" I said. ""They need to bring back soil samples from different locations around the planet. Then they need to mix it together in the labs so we can see if any of it has the ability to grow.""
""And how long will that take?"" he asked.
""It depends,"" I told him. ""The soil sample will only tell you part of the story. We need to do tests to see what kind of plant it might grow into."" I paused and took a deep breath before continuing. ""You're going to need at least one year, maybe two or three, to figure this out.""
""Do you have any other suggestions?"" he asked, leaning forward again.
""Well, another thing you could do is get more people involved,"" I told him. ""Maybe some of your political rivals who aren't currently on the council. If you had enough people working on it, it might make progress faster.""
""You think that's a good idea?"" he asked.
""Sure, why not? It'll get them out of their offices and doing something useful for once,"" I said with a laugh.
""I like it,"" President Kuklo said with a smile. ""We can send a message to the other members of the council and ask them if they'd be interested in helping out. Once they hear about the food supply problem, they'll probably want to get involved.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""But you also need to let them know that it will take a lot longer than one or two months to find a solution.""
""I agree with you on that,"" he said. ""And we'll need to make sure they understand that we can't just start growing crops out here on Mars. The plants need sunlight, which we don't have much of here on the planet.""
""I'll talk to Dr. Sato,"" I said. ""She's already working on some things with plants that can grow without the sun.""
""Good,"" President Kuklo said with a nod. ""Let me know when you've talked to her, and I'll put the word out to the others."" He stood up from his chair and looked down at me. ""Now, I'm going to go tell our agricultural team about this so they can start planning their next move. You can call me back if you have any questions.""
As the president left his office, I took a deep breath and sat back in my seat. I didn't really know what to think about the whole thing. We were going to have to work on a solution to the food shortage, but I wasn't sure how I was supposed to help with it. All I knew was that I would do whatever it took to keep our colony alive and thriving.

258,R_3Gm1u74qDqlN8U5,ACE_HF_7,High Fantasy,Ace of Spade,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Is that where we are?"" Kari asked as she rode beside him. ""It looks so peaceful.""
""Yes,"" he answered quietly. ""And I think you will find it is more than just empty houses."" He pointed down to the water below them. ""That's where the river enters the lake, which leads into an underground cavern system that runs all the way beneath this entire mountain range. That is where the city lies hidden.""
Kari turned her mount toward the left side of the valley where the road led off between tall, thick-trunked pine trees. She could see a long, low wall stretching across the width of the road there and a pair of guards posted atop it. As soon as they came closer, one stepped forward to block their path.
""State your business here, travelers,"" the man said. His tone wasn't particularly threatening; in fact, it seemed almost friendly, if only slightly suspicious.
Kari dismounted and approached him, still holding onto the reins of her horse. ""I am Lady Vanador and these are my companions,"" she told him. ""We were hoping to make our way to the capital and would like to speak to the governor about a few things before we do.""
""A few things?"" the soldier repeated. ""You mean to say you have no particular purpose other than to visit the king? You aren't going to cause any trouble?""
""No trouble!"" she replied sharply. ""If anything, I'm looking for someone who might have been involved in a recent matter. We're not here to steal anything or hurt anyone. All we want is to talk with the king and his council about whatever may have happened.""
The soldier studied her for a moment then nodded and gestured back behind him. ""Follow me. I'll take you to the governor himself.""
They made their way past the village and around to the right side of the valley where another set of guards stood watch over the entrance to the tunnel that ran underneath the mountain range. The soldiers there directed the party into the passageway that wound its way through the stone until they finally emerged outside the palace gates.
Kari noticed immediately how much larger the building appeared once inside the walls. While there had been several buildings scattered throughout the valley, each one of them had been dwarfed by the sheer size of the main structure. This place was immense. She knew it was designed to appear that way because it served as both the seat of government and the home of the king. The great hall alone could probably hold a thousand people at once and still leave room for a dance floor. There were smaller structures nearby, though, that must serve as offices and meeting places for the councilors and the governor. They weren't quite as impressive, but even those were large enough to house hundreds of people.
She followed the soldier through the doors into the main hall, where three men waited near the throne. One wore the uniform of a captain, while the others wore plain clothes, but they all looked well-dressed and prosperous. Two of them stared intently at something on the ground near the dais while the third spoke softly with the king. When he saw them coming, the king rose to his feet.
""Lady Vanador, welcome,"" he greeted them. ""Your reputation precedes you and I appreciate you bringing your friends along with you as well. I assume you've come to discuss a matter concerning Lord Vanador, yes?""
""Indeed we have,"" she confirmed. ""My father has informed us that you know of a woman named Serenjolsa who recently took part in a plot against his life and yours. If you remember anything else about her or her involvement, please tell me now.""
The king rubbed his chin thoughtfully then shook his head. ""I can recall little else, other than what Lord Vanador already knows. Her name was never mentioned directly to me, nor did I hear it spoken by any member of my court. But I cannot imagine she wouldn't have spoken of herself if she had done something wrong. Did she say anything of note?""
Kari shook her head. ""Not really. My father believes she was working for someone else, perhaps trying to get information from him, but he doesn't seem convinced she actually killed him.""
""Well, it is possible she didn't kill him,"" the king suggested. ""He could very easily have survived and fled somewhere. It's also possible he didn't die at all, despite appearances to the contrary.""
""What do you mean?"" Kari asked.
""Serenjolsa has been known to play mind games,"" the king explained. ""In fact, she used to do so with my brother, Jarlaxle, when we were younger. He believed she had poisoned his food, so when he was feeling ill, he went to her chambers to ask her why. She gave him a potion to drink, which made him believe he was dying, so he fell unconscious. Once he woke up, however, he found that he felt perfectly fine. In fact, he was better than ever! So, of course, he couldn't understand why she would poison him without warning him first, so he demanded answers. Instead of giving him a straight answer, she simply disappeared. He spent years searching for her, but it was always just rumors that he'd heard that led nowhere. Eventually, he learned of her death, but that, too, proved false. He eventually concluded that she had faked her own death and lived on to continue playing her games, which she does quite frequently. Even after her death, there are rumors of her sightings everywhere. Some say she died long ago and that this is merely a trick of some sort.""
""So, maybe she faked her own death?"" Kari asked.
""Perhaps, but there is no proof of such a thing. And, as I said, it isn't impossible that she might not have been the one who poisoned my brother. She was, after all, a very skilled liar. Perhaps she just played along to fool everyone. I don't know, but it seems unlikely that she could be responsible for killing my brother. However, there is a possibility that someone else might be.""
Kari nodded. ""Who could it possibly be? Who could stand to gain more than your brother?""
The king considered her question carefully, and Kari could see he wasn't sure of the answer. Finally, he sighed and said, ""As I said, there are many possibilities. Serenjolsa was a very intelligent woman and, as I said, a skilled liar. She might be behind this, but it's just as likely that someone else could have hired her, or that she may have been acting as a dupe for someone else entirely. Or it could just be a coincidence.""
Kari frowned and looked at the two guards. ""And you two, what do you think?""
Both of them shrugged helplessly. Neither one seemed to be able to give a solid reason for thinking the governor was involved, but neither one was willing to outright deny it either.
The king nodded.",1254,-0.3651037609010624,1.2928082297933134,-0.0031303688671655157,0.9138158591191314,-0.06445396384138768

""Where are we?"" Elisabeth asked as they rode towards the settlement.
""We're about halfway between Solanis and Varni,"" Erland replied. ""It's a common stop for merchants travelling between those two cities.""
""Is it safe?""
""I'm sure it is,"" he assured her, keeping his voice calm. His hand had remained around the hilt of his sword ever since leaving the castle and he hadn't let go of it until now.
Elisabeth's eyes narrowed suspiciously at him. ""Are you going to let me finish my question?""
He sighed heavily, though whether he did so in exasperation or just the effort of holding on to his anger was unclear. ""I promise I won't do anything reckless without letting you know first."" He lowered his hand. ""As much as it pains me to admit it, we'll need your help if we want to get inside that tower.""
""And why would I want to help you?"" she asked, the annoyance clear in her tone.
He smiled reassuringly at her and patted the horse's neck. ""Because I can see in the dark.""
""What?""
""Look at my face,"" he said softly. ""Can you see anything there?""
She frowned. ""You look fine.""
He grinned widely at her, then pulled out his lantern and waved it back and forth over his face.
""Oh!"" she cried as the light flashed over him. ""Why didn't you say so earlier?""
""That's because I'm not a complete moron.""
She rolled her eyes but laughed anyway. ""All right. So, what is this place?""
""It's called Portol. It used to be a bustling settlement with several towers around the lake, but they're all deserted now. Some say the land was cursed or that the lord of the area was an evil sorcerer who turned his own people against one another. Most likely, it was just an isolated spot along the trade routes where nobody wanted to live.
""Whatever the reason, the lord abandoned the town a long time ago, leaving the towers as ruins. He built a new manor house in the forest on the other side of the river, but most of the inhabitants have moved to Varni in search of better opportunities.""
""But why would anyone want to move here? What's left to do? Fish the lake or chop down trees?"" Elisabeth asked skeptically.
Erland chuckled. ""Nothing you would be interested in, I imagine. They probably just need more hands for the new farm they're establishing near the lake. That's why they're hiring.""
Elisabeth's eyebrows shot up as she looked at him curiously. ""A farm? Do they plan to start a farm?""
He shook his head. ""No, that was just me reading into the conversation we overheard. The old lord said he was hiring more guards.""
She snorted. ""Why would they do that?""
""Because I don't think the last ones lived very long after he told them about it."" Erland gestured towards the tower to their right with his thumb. ""They were all dead by morning.""
Elisabeth shivered. ""Do you think they came to kill the new guards too?""
He nodded. ""Probably.""
""And there are so many of them that they can afford to hire more?"" she asked, looking around the village suspiciously. ""How much money does this place even produce? There aren't any shops, no stalls. Are they growing anything on those hills over there?""
""I don't know,"" he replied as he kicked his horse forward, keeping it well out of range of the others. ""But I can tell you what they're not doing…and that's fishing. The river Tethys runs all the way to the lake, and the only way to get water is to draw from it."" He pulled the reins and guided the horse over to the tower where the two sentinels stood guard, then dismounted and tied the horse to the hitching post outside the entrance. He reached into a saddlebag he had strapped to the horse's back and pulled out the key, unlocking the door. ""Come on, I'll show you around.""
He held the lantern aloft as he led her through the dark interior of the tower, leading her to the staircase that descended down into the basement. They made their way carefully, in case anyone was hiding inside. The staircase ended at a small hallway with four doors along one side. Two of the doors were closed; one was slightly ajar; and the fourth, directly across from them, was open.
Erland opened the door and stepped inside, Elisabeth following close behind him. The room was bare except for an iron safe, several boxes of candles, and some sacks full of food. In the corner sat a large wooden table with three chairs around it. The floor beneath them had been swept clean of debris, but not cleaned very thoroughly. A single chair had been placed before the table, facing away from the door. The only other piece of furniture in the room was the lone bed positioned against one wall. It was empty and showed no sign that anyone had slept there recently.
""Now, we know that the first group of guards that died weren't attacked by this place itself,"" Erland said softly. ""I'm pretty certain that they were poisoned by whoever was trying to kill us.""
""How do you know?"" Elisabeth asked.
He frowned. ""Because I just did.""
She glanced at him curiously. ""You mean…you think someone is here now?""
Erland nodded. ""Yes.""
Elisabeth swallowed hard. ""I don't suppose you have any idea who it could be? Maybe I could talk to them first. You know, see what they're like, what their goals are.""
Erland shook his head. ""I already tried. Whoever is inside there doesn't want to talk. Not to me at least.""
""How can you tell?"" she asked. ""It's so dark in here; I can't even see your face.""
He pulled down the lantern and pointed towards a small section of the ceiling directly over the table. ""The light's not reflecting off the glass on the lantern. That means whoever is in there is using a different source of light. And you can tell who's talking based on the way their words bounce off the walls, right?""
Elisabeth nodded. ""So?""
He chuckled. ""It means that someone is whispering.""
Her eyes widened slightly. ""They're still alive, then?""
""I'd bet my life on it,"" he replied. ""Though, I'm not sure if I should be pleased or afraid. The last time we went up against an enemy that used magic, you were pretty useless. I hope this is going to be easier for you to deal with.""",1164,0.696450085590544,0.1873626013310371,0.3073523473770459,0.07904552379134891,-0.15249914103579051
260,R_31EMj0jYgJDDHoi,BAS_HOR_4,Horror,Basic Coherence,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my own reflection; it had black eyes and red lips like something out of an old horror movie. The figure reached through the mirror and grabbed me by the neck. My body went limp as its cold hands squeezed tightly around my throat. A sharp pain shot through my chest as I gasped for air.
""You're mine now,"" said the figure in my reflection. ""You belong to me.""
The figure pulled me closer and began kissing my neck. Its tongue licked across my skin before sinking inside of me. I felt myself getting wetter with every passing second.
I opened my mouth wide so that it could have more access to my throat. As soon as I did, the figure's head pushed down and entered my mouth. It was warm and moist, but not too much. Just enough to make me feel good.
It started thrusting its hips against mine. Each time it did, it made my body shake and shiver. It kept going even after I came. Then suddenly, it stopped.
""What are you doing?"" I asked. ""Why aren't you making me cum anymore? You promised!""
""Oh no, sweetheart,"" the figure said. ""That's not what this is about.""
The figure stood up and turned around. It then took off all of its clothes except for one item—a mask. It put on the mask and picked me up by the waist. It carried me over to the bed and laid me down. The figure climbed onto the bed and straddled my stomach. It lowered itself down until it was sitting between my legs.
""Now, we can do whatever we want together,"" said the figure. ""We'll be partners forever.""
As it spoke, the figure placed its hand on top of my thigh. It slowly moved upwards until it reached my pussy. The figure spread my lips apart and began rubbing its fingers against my clit.
""This is how I'm gonna take care of you,"" said the figure. ""Every night. Every day. Forever.""
I moaned loudly as the figure continued playing with my pussy. It rubbed my clit and inserted two of its fingers inside of me. I closed my eyes tight as the pleasure grew stronger and stronger. My breathing became heavier and heavier until I couldn't breathe at all.
""Please... don't stop..."" I whispered.
The figure didn't listen. Instead, it shoved its fingers deeper inside of me. I screamed out in pain as my body tensed up. Then the figure removed its fingers from my pussy. It replaced them with its cock. It positioned the tip right above my pussy and pushed forward. I let out another scream as the figure penetrated me.
""Ahhh! Nooo! Please... please don't hurt me!""
The figure ignored my pleas and began fucking me hard. I cried out louder than ever before. My cries echoed throughout the room until they were drowned out by the sound of the bed crashing against the wall.
The figure fucked me harder and faster until I finally climaxed. I screamed out loud as waves of pleasure coursed through my entire body. The figure kept pounding away at me until it came too. It collapsed on top of me, panting heavily.
""That was amazing,"" said the figure. ""Let's do it again sometime.""
The figure lifted itself off of me and sat next to the bed. I lay there motionless, unable to move or speak. After a few moments, the figure leaned over and kissed me on the forehead.
""Goodnight, sweetheart,"" it said. ""Sweet dreams.""
Then it left the room. I waited for the door to close before I rolled over and tried to get some sleep. But I couldn't fall asleep. All I could think about was that figure. What had happened to me? Why was I being taken advantage of like this?
I thought about calling the police, but I knew that wouldn't help. They'd just tell me that I must have been dreaming. There was nothing I could do. So instead, I decided to try and forget about it. I would pretend that none of it had ever happened.
But that was easier said than done. I couldn't stop thinking about that figure. I wondered if it was real. If it was, where was it now? Did it go home and fuck its wife and kids while I was still lying here in bed?
I tossed and turned all night long. Eventually, I fell into a deep sleep. When I awoke, the figure was standing over me once again. It stared down at me with those red lips and black eyes.
""Hello, sweetheart,"" said the figure. ""How are you feeling today?""
""I'm okay,"" I replied.
""Are you sure you're alright?"" asked the figure. ""Do you need anything? Would you like to talk about last night?""
""No,"" I said. ""I'm fine.""
The figure smiled and nodded. Then it stepped closer and kissed me on the cheek.
""Thank you for letting me stay with you,"" said the figure. ""I promise I won't cause any trouble.""
""Okay,"" I replied. ""I'm glad you're staying with me.""
The figure smiled and gave me a hug. I wrapped my arms around it and held it tight. I felt safe in its embrace.
""Don't worry,"" said the figure. ""I'll always be there for you. I'll never leave your side.""
I hugged the figure tighter and buried my face into its chest. I didn't know why, but I felt safer when it was hugging me like that.
""I love you,"" I whispered. ""Please don't ever leave me alone.""
""I won't,"" said the figure. ""Never again.""
The figure left the room and closed the door behind it. I got out of bed and went downstairs. I fixed myself some breakfast and ate it in the living room. Then I cleaned up the dishes and went upstairs to take a shower. I washed my hair and brushed my teeth. Then I put on a fresh set of clothes.
When I finished dressing, I went outside and sat down on the porch. I watched the sun rise over the horizon. It was beautiful. The sky was filled with bright colors and fluffy clouds. Birds chirped and fluttered their wings as they flew overhead.
I sat there for hours, watching the sunrise. I felt calm and peaceful. I was happy. I was finally free of that horrible figure.",1109,0.07036233528717166,0.7613291530787571,0.7784017534634025,0.5047170882760956,0.5171410847311951
261,R_3EHlXFoGrL93Hy8,BAS_HOR_1,Horror,Basic Coherence,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my own; it had an old man's features. The eyes were sunken in its wrinkled skin, and it was wearing a white robe with a hood pulled over his head.
""Who are you?"" I asked. ""What do you want?""
The face didn't answer right away. Instead, he just stared at me for what seemed like forever before finally speaking.
""You're going to die,"" he said.
It was then that I realized this was no dream. This was real life, and someone was standing behind me watching me sleep. I turned around quickly, but the person was gone. I looked down at myself, but everything was fine. There was nothing wrong with me. My arms and legs felt normal. Then I remembered the voice I'd heard earlier. I went back to the mirror and saw the same thing staring back at me.
""Why did you say that?"" I asked him. ""Do you know something about me? What is your name?""
Again, he didn't respond right away. He just stood there silently as if he couldn't move or speak. After a while, he started moving again and spoke.
""My name is Death.""
Death? That's not really a name. It sounds more like a title than anything else.
""Well, why don't you tell me who you are instead?"" I asked. ""If you're going to be telling me I'm going to die, shouldn't we get to know each other first?""
He didn't respond right away, so I waited patiently. Finally, he answered.
""I am Death,"" he said. ""And you will die tonight.""
Then he disappeared. I turned around to see where he went, but he was nowhere to be seen. I shrugged my shoulders and headed back to bed. Maybe he was just some kind of hallucination brought on by the painkillers I'd taken. But when I closed my eyes, I could still feel him staring at me through the mirror.
I woke up to another knock on the glass. I opened my eyes and sat straight up in bed. I looked over at the clock beside my bed. It read 5:30 AM. I looked back at the mirror and saw the same old man standing behind me.
""Is this a joke?"" I asked. ""Are you trying to scare me? If so, it isn't working.""
He didn't respond right away. Instead, he just kept staring at me. His face was expressionless. I decided to try and talk to him again.
""Look, I'm sorry,"" I said. ""But I don't have time for your games. You can go now.""
That's when he moved. He stepped forward and grabbed hold of my neck. Before I knew it, he was choking me. I tried to fight back, but I couldn't even breathe. I reached out for the lamp next to my bed, but I missed. As soon as I let go, he released me. I fell to the floor gasping for air. I looked up and saw him standing over me.
""Now, I'm going to kill you,"" he said.
Before I could react, he punched me in the stomach. I doubled over, and all I could do was gasp for breath. He grabbed hold of my throat again and squeezed until I passed out.
When I awoke, I was lying on the ground. I looked up and saw the same old man standing over me.
""Hello, David,"" he said. ""I've been waiting for you.""
I wanted to ask him how he knew my name, but I was too weak to get up. All I could do was stare up at him.
""You're going to die tonight,"" he repeated.
I nodded my head. I couldn't speak. I was too tired.
""Good,"" he said. ""Because you're mine now.""
Then he disappeared.
I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed. I looked over at the clock beside my bed. It read 7:00 AM. I hadn't slept long enough to feel rested, but I felt better than I had in days. I got up and went to take a shower. I needed to wash off the blood and dirt that covered my body. I took a quick look at my reflection in the mirror. I didn't recognize myself. My face was pale and gaunt. I looked like I'd aged ten years since yesterday.
I finished getting dressed and headed downstairs to make breakfast. When I walked into the kitchen, my mom was sitting at the table drinking coffee. She looked up at me and smiled.
""How are you feeling today?"" she asked.
I shrugged my shoulders and sat down across from her.
""I think I'll live,"" I said. ""Where's dad?""
She shook her head.
""He hasn't gotten up yet,"" she replied. ""He's been sleeping in the living room ever since you came home last night. Do you remember anything?""
I looked down at the table.
""No,"" I said. ""I don't remember anything.""
""Maybe you should call Dr. Greenfield,"" she suggested.
I nodded my head and dialed the number. After a few rings, he picked up.
""Dr. Greenfield, this is David,"" I said. ""I need to talk to you about something.""
He sighed and put down the phone.
""David?"" he said. ""What happened to you?""
I told him everything that had happened. When I was done, he was silent for several seconds.
""I see,"" he said. ""Well, I guess we'd best get you to the hospital then.""
""Wait, what?"" I asked. ""Why?""
""Don't worry about that right now,"" he said. ""Just come over here and let me examine you.""
I hung up the phone and headed back upstairs. I packed my things and waited for my mom to come home from work. When she arrived, I helped her carry my father to the car. We drove to the hospital and checked him in. They ran some tests, and they found nothing wrong with him. A couple hours later, the doctor called us into his office.
""I'm afraid your father has suffered a severe stroke,"" he said. ""We're going to run some more tests, but I'm pretty sure he won't make it through the night.""
My mother started crying. I held her hand and wiped away the tears that were streaming down her cheeks.",1081,0.30065023165250265,0.7770858413772112,0.5499766256642327,-0.45061862292371346,0.5697363567065467
262,R_23gE2gf2686tdSF,GEN_HF_2,High Fantasy,Genesis,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They circled around one tower before landing near the shoreline where they were met by three men wearing leather armor and carrying spears. Their faces were hidden behind steel masks that had been painted black.
""Welcome to my village,"" said the tallest man, his voice deep and rumbling. ""What do you want?""
""We seek your help.""
The tall man's eyes narrowed as he studied them. ""Why would I help you? You're strangers with no reputation among us.""
""Because we have something that belongs to you.""
All three warriors stiffened at this, the taller man stepping forward. ""Who are you?""
""I am called Zephyr,"" said Nia, lifting her chin proudly. She gave him a quick bow then turned to look at the other two. ""This is Ryn and Vaelin.""
Zephyr eyed them warily. ""And what do you have that belongs to me?""
Nia gave him an impish grin. ""A dragon egg.""
The warrior's eyes widened momentarily before narrowing again. ""You wouldn't dare… no, it must be true. How did you find it?"" He nodded at the basket hanging from Ryn's back.
Ryn shrugged. ""It fell down from the heavens.""
""As if there were such things,"" muttered the nearest warrior.
""I'm not joking,"" said Nia. ""There are dragons living in the mountains south of here. We found the egg washed up on the shore after a rainstorm and brought it here."" She paused to take a deep breath before continuing. ""We need your help retrieving it from the mountains.""
One of the warriors stepped forward, pointing a spear toward the sky. ""Come away now! This is no place for you!""
""Stay back!"" Nia shouted.
Her warning was too late as the tallest warrior leapt forward, swinging his spear at her. Nia's arm moved faster than anyone could follow, her fingers curling into a fist and snapping outwards, catching the spear-wielder across the face just below his mask. The impact sent the man stumbling backward, both hands grasping at his head, blood flowing freely from a split lip.
Another of the warriors recovered quickly and swung his spear at Nia again, this time aiming for her legs. She sidestepped easily though, her feet moving swiftly beneath her as she spun to meet the attack, her foot slamming into the warrior's groin before he could get his spear fully upright. His scream reverberated off the surrounding cliffs as he doubled over, clutching at his injured privates while Nia kicked him in the ribs and sent him collapsing to the ground.
She glanced at the third warrior, who had backed away from the scene and was staring at her with open disbelief. ""Are you okay?""
He nodded numbly. ""Yes, thank you.""
""Well, let's go then.""
The three of them hurried toward the village as fast as they dared without looking like they were trying to run. As they drew closer, Nia could see several more warriors standing in clusters around the buildings. None of them made any move to approach them but she still felt nervous. It was clear these men weren't going to give her the benefit of the doubt and she didn't blame them. Not after what had happened to the last person who tried to steal an egg from their village.
They entered the village and headed toward the largest building which appeared to be the only inn. Several villagers were gathered outside, talking quietly together. They stopped speaking when they saw the newcomers and watched silently as Nia and Ryn dragged the unconscious warrior inside the building. The other warriors approached the inn door cautiously, spears held ready, their faces hidden behind their masks.
The interior of the inn was dark and smoky, a fire pit burning brightly in the center of the room. Two tables had been pushed together at one end with a few stools placed around them. There were a handful of people seated at the tables, all watching the newcomers with suspicion. One man stood from his seat and walked over, holding a jug of wine and a cup. Nia recognized him as the innkeeper.
""What are you doing bringing trouble like this into our home?"" he asked. ""Take your friend and leave before I call the others.""
Ryn glared at him. ""Do you really think you'll be able to stop us?""
The man smiled grimly, placing the jug and cup on the table. ""Try me.""
""If you don't let us sit down and drink first, there won't be anything left for you to try.""
The innkeeper chuckled. ""Very well then, you can have whatever you wish.""
Ryn took a stool beside the table and gestured for Nia and Vaelin to join him. ""Thank you.""
""Don't mention it.""
""So, how did you find this place?"" asked Ryn, pouring himself some wine.
""It was mentioned by someone we encountered on the road.""
""How far are you from the mountains?""
""Not far. About two days' journey.""
""Good, because it seems the egg is about to hatch. We've seen signs of activity in the area.""
""Activity?""
""Dragons. Lots of them.""
Nia stared at him in surprise. ""You mean you're expecting a baby dragon?""
""That's right.""
The innkeeper placed a wooden platter on the table and brought over three steaming bowls of stew, setting them down before the travelers. ""Eat, eat. I'll bring another pot of stew later.""
Ryn thanked him and helped himself to some stew, helping himself to a second bowl after Nia finished hers. ""Tell me, how big is this egg?""
""It has yet to hatch so it's hard to say for sure. Judging from size and shape, I'd guess it will be somewhere between three and five meters long. That's pretty average for an egg from one of the larger species.""
""A dragon?"" asked Nia.
""No, not exactly. They're actually half human and half dragon. The offspring of a dragon and a human.""
""Where do they come from?""
""From eggs. Like the one you have with you.""
""I thought they hatched from live dragons?""
The innkeeper laughed. ""Sure, in stories. But the truth is that the eggs of most species are laid by the parents in caves or under rocks. When they're ready to hatch, the mother moves them to a safe place, often a cave or a nest high up in a tree. Then she leaves to hunt, leaving the father to fend for himself until the young emerge from their shells.""
""Fend for themselves?""
The innkeeper nodded. ""Most of the time it's just a matter of waiting.",1156,0.7709264435622428,1.4587175272804598,0.0889368008361583,0.12920707244592192,-0.23803364050981146

A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is where we'll find them,"" said the captain as he led his men down the path leading toward the shore. ""They're probably holed up in one of those towers.""
As they approached, they could see that there were several buildings clustered around the base of each tower. They seemed to have been constructed hastily, without any real care put into their construction. Most of the windows had holes punched in them while others were boarded up entirely. Some of the walls had collapsed completely, leaving only piles of rubble behind.
""I don't know if I'd call this place 'hospitable',"" said Vaelin.
""It's not much better than a prison camp,"" agreed the captain. ""But you can't blame them for being wary after what happened here last night.""
Vaelin followed him as he walked among the ruins until they reached a building which appeared to have survived intact. He peered inside and saw a large room with wooden floors and walls made from stone blocks. There were no furnishings save for a few rickety tables and chairs scattered about and a fire pit in the center of the floor.
""Looks like someone's still living here,"" said the captain. ""We should get moving before they notice us.""
He led his men back outside and began walking toward the nearest tower. As they neared the structure, Vaelin heard voices coming from within.
""What do you think?"" asked a woman's voice.
""Not good,"" replied a man's. ""There's too many of them. We won't stand a chance against so many.""
""Then we need to move quickly,"" she said. ""If we don't leave now, we might never make it away from this place alive.""
""You're right,"" he conceded. ""Let's go.""
The door opened and four armed men stepped out onto the walkway. Two of them carried bows while the other two held spears. All four wore leather armor and carried short swords. They were also carrying packs stuffed with provisions.
""Who are you?"" demanded one of the archers.
""Just travelers passing through,"" said the captain. ""My name is Captain Alric. What's yours?""
""Sulcifer,"" said the man. ""And these are my friends. We've come looking for work.""
""Well, Sulcifer, looks like you found it,"" said the leader. ""Come inside, we'll talk business.""
Inside the building, Vaelin noticed a number of doors leading off the main hall. Each had a crude sign nailed to its surface. One read 'Food', another 'Bathroom' and yet another 'Bed'. He wondered how long it would take for the inhabitants of this place to realize that they needed to add a 'Death' option.
""So, what sort of work are you offering?"" asked Captain Alric.
""Anything you want,"" said Sulcifer. ""We're mercenaries, so we can fight if you need us to but we prefer not to unless absolutely necessary. We'll do whatever you ask us to. Just give me an opportunity to earn enough coin to buy passage home.""
""That's very generous of you,"" said Alric. ""But I'm afraid we can't pay you anything. This is a military operation, nothing more. You're going to be fighting alongside our troops.""
""Against who?"" asked Sulcifer. ""Is there a war going on? If so, I'd love to join in.""
Alric shook his head. ""No, we're just trying to keep order in the kingdom. The people here aren't happy with the way things are run, so we're going to teach them a lesson. That's all.""
""Sounds like fun,"" said Sulcifer. ""What's the plan?""
""We're going to attack the town,"" said Alric. ""Once we've done that, we'll march on the palace. Once we're inside, we'll burn the king and queen alive. After that, we'll round up the rest of the royal family and hang them from the castle walls.""
""How will we know where they are?"" asked Sulcifer.
""We'll send scouts ahead,"" said Alric. ""When we reach the gates, we'll set fire to the city. Anyone left in the streets will die. It's that simple.""
""Sounds easy enough,"" said Sulcifer. ""Do you have any weapons?""
""Aye,"" said Alric. ""We have plenty of swords and shields. And I suppose you can have a bow if you like.""
""I don't know if I can use a bow,"" said Sulcifer. ""I haven't used one since I was a boy.""
""Don't worry about that,"" said Alric. ""Just point it at the enemy and pull the string.""
""Fair enough,"" said Sulcifer. ""Lead the way then.""
""Right,"" said Alric. ""Follow me.""
""Are you sure about this?"" asked Vaelin. ""I thought you said you weren't planning to kill anyone.""
""I'm not,"" said Alric. ""We're just going to scare them a little. Besides, if we really wanted to kill everyone here, we wouldn't need to hire mercenaries. We could simply storm the place ourselves and slaughter every last person in the place.""
""You sound awfully certain about that,"" said Vaelin. ""Why would you risk your life and those of your men for something like this? Surely you could get more money doing legitimate work.""
""Because I believe in what I'm doing,"" said Alric. ""I don't know why you're asking me these questions, anyway. You're a monk, aren't you? I imagine you know all about the importance of justice and righteousness. So, tell me, brother, do you believe in killing innocent people for the sake of a cause you don't even understand?""
""I don't know,"" said Vaelin. ""I've never killed anyone myself.""
""That doesn't mean you can't,"" said Alric. ""All it takes is a single arrow to end someone's life. A single sword thrust to cut a man in half. Or a fist to smash a skull. The difference between you and me is that I choose not to do such things. But I don't judge you for it. I don't condemn you because you disagree with my beliefs.

264,R_2amZuxuPDM4hSWO,OUR_HR_7,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her blond hair, pulled back into a braid, hung over her shoulders; the two brown pigtails hanging below her ears made his hands twitch with wanting to touch them.
She'd had a wreath of flowers on her head that morning, but now they were long gone from her dark tresses and tangled in a mess of braids. She didn't seem to care about how she looked, though; she ate from the common bowl in front of her, wearing only a peasant's dress—thin woolen strips sewn together with string. The sleeves had been rolled up to the elbow so that her slender arms could move freely. A copper ring pierced each of her nostrils and another one was embedded in her lower lip.
But it wasn't those piercings or her clothing that drew his attention. He had noticed the way she moved, like a wild thing, glancing around at the people who passed by while she chewed at a piece of bread with gusto. No wonder she never touched water. There was a taut, lean body under her coarse clothes. He'd thought so the moment she came into the tavern, but then the man beside him, who he recognized as her escort, had spoken to her in a voice full of kindness and she had turned away, not looking at him again.
Her escort, he knew, was a merchant from one of the northern villages. He'd come to see her; what for, he couldn't say. It didn't matter, though. What mattered was that he hadn't been able to meet her gaze. That she had kept her eyes fixed on her own plate, so that no one but him could tell how much she hated him.
It had taken him a long time to understand why. Because she was different. Because she had a mind and spirit unlike any other. She was beautiful, but more than that, she was mysterious. He wanted to know more about her, but there wasn't anything to learn. Her eyes would always keep him at bay.
When his shift was over, he had gone back to his family's house, where his mother greeted him with a smile, a hug, and a kiss on the cheek. She made him dinner and told him that she loved him. He smiled and looked out the window into the garden.
In the moonlight, he could see his father, seated in a chair beside the stream, watching the fish swim against the current. The wind carried their voices away into the night, and everything around him was calm, peaceful. But he couldn't feel the same way. Not when the girl was standing near his house, looking in through the windows with a longing look.
After dinner he sat down at the table and said, ""I want to go away. I can't live here anymore.""
""You'll get yourself killed,"" his mother warned him.
He went on. ""But I need to do this, Mother. For the sake of my future, for the sake of you and Father. And for me. I can't live like this. I won't be satisfied until I'm living somewhere else. In a different place, far from here.""
""All right,"" she agreed. ""As long as you promise to come home soon.""
The next morning, he rode away from home. When he reached the forest, he left his horse at the foot of an oak and hid among its branches, then climbed to the top of the tree, where he could see the village. It seemed smaller than it used to, even though it wasn't more than a week since he'd last looked. There were fewer lights in the houses; most of them were dark. People were moving slowly, like old people who are too tired to go about their business. He could smell smoke in the air. He wondered how they would feel if he came down and offered to help them.
His legs ached, so he climbed back to the ground and walked north into the forest. When he reached the river, he followed its course upstream and then turned south. After a long time, he finally came to a small settlement and made camp beside it, by the edge of the road that ran between two rows of fields.
That evening, when the sun set, he went to the settlement and asked the people there if he could buy something to eat. They were surprised to see him, but he managed to tell them how he had been living in the forest for the past few days, trying to find his way out of the woods and into the rest of the world. When he finished talking, they invited him to stay with them, but he refused. He didn't want anyone else to know how lost he was. He had enough problems already without bringing others into his life.
So he slept outside in the cold that night, on the grass in front of their house, wrapped up in a blanket that he had brought with him. The next morning, he thanked them and left. After walking for a while, he found another settlement and went to the inn there to ask if he could have some food. The innkeeper let him sit and drink until the day grew old, then told him he could sleep in the back room.
He thanked the man and walked on. In the afternoon, he came across a village, where he went to the inn, as usual, and asked for food and drink. A short time later, he asked the innkeeper for a bed for the night. It was the same thing every night.
In the morning, he thanked the man, ate what was given to him, and left.
Every time he did this, he was hoping to find himself somewhere new, but no matter how far he went, he always came back to the same places: to the forest, to the river, to the road, to the villages, to the inns. Each day, he made a little money from selling his knife at the inn. He would keep most of it and use it to buy more food, which he could eat on the way. If he was lucky, someone would give him a place to sleep. Every day he bought himself another piece of cloth—this one red, like the color of her eyes. When he found something good, he would hide it in his pocket and forget about it.
When he reached a city, he didn't go straight to an inn. Instead, he stopped in front of the buildings where people were working and begged for food or money. Once he got a few pieces of bread, he wandered around, looking in the windows, and when he saw something that he wanted, he would take it out of its hiding place, hide it in his bag, and go on his way.
He thought about going to the city again, where he might be able to earn a living, but whenever he tried to move there, his feet refused to walk forward. It took a long time before he understood why.
A week after leaving home, he reached a city called Avaldsnes. It was big and lively, with wide streets and tall buildings. In the middle of town, he came across a big house with a garden surrounded by a wall. The front gate was locked, but he found a door on the side, hidden behind a bush, and managed to climb over the wall. He walked down a path between the flower beds and saw a young couple standing on the other side of a low stone wall. A little farther ahead, he saw another one, and then two more.",1325,0.5206093046783584,0.6711727004408296,0.5390943237306909,-0.5823770633274716,-0.2127516404538804
265,R_ZyDPC2KBSi8DrJn,GEN_HR_4,Historical Romance,Genesis,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been working on cleaning up the beer spilled by some of the drunks who came in before closing. The girl's gaze had locked onto him as she sat there drinking what looked to be a cup of wine. A man stood behind her, a tall, handsome fellow with dark hair and bright eyes. For a moment he thought it might have been an escort, but when he spoke to the woman and turned his back to the room, Kip realized that this must be the mysterious stranger. The two were talking quietly. Kip heard only bits of their conversation. It seemed they were both searching for someone. When the man rose from his seat, the girl followed him out of the tavern without looking back at Kip or saying anything more to him.
This encounter had happened several weeks ago, but it still haunted Kip's dreams. He couldn't get the image of the woman out of his mind. Her long brown hair fell over her shoulders and down her back. His fingers itched just thinking about brushing through those soft strands. And her eyes—he could see himself buried beneath them for days. They were a pale gray color, almost silver.
Kip knew he was no good for anyone. He was not wealthy; he wore cheap clothes because he couldn't afford better ones. He wasn't particularly handsome. In fact, most people would probably describe him as plain. But he did have a certain charm. He was tall, strong, and quick-witted. He also had a great sense of humor. He didn't take life too seriously. People liked him. That's why his father had sent him here in the first place.
He rubbed his hands together nervously. It had been five years since he arrived in this city, and he hadn't found a job yet. But he didn't really care about that. What he wanted was to meet someone like the mysterious woman who'd walked into the bar. Not someone like his father or mother, whose marriages were miserable and ended in divorce. Or someone like his brother, who married the wrong woman and lived a joyless life. No, what Kip had been hoping for all these years was to find someone like the mysterious stranger from the tavern. Someone beautiful and smart and strong enough to stand beside him against everything.
At least he had met one person like that once. He had been twelve at the time, and her name was Cinda. She had loved animals like he did, and she had teased him mercilessly, even when they weren't alone. He remembered how her smile would light up the whole world around him. The way he felt when he saw her had made him feel as if nothing else mattered anymore.
So when he saw her again, sitting at the same table in the tavern, he was ecstatic. If she recognized him, he was sure he would lose his chance forever. He had to act quickly. He had to speak to her before she left. If he could get close to her, maybe somehow convince her that she should stay here with him, then perhaps he would finally have a chance to show her what life was supposed to be like.
""I'll buy you another drink,"" Kip said loudly.
She looked up at him, and her eyes widened slightly. ""Are you offering me a bribe?"" she asked in a throaty voice.
He grinned. ""No, I'm buying my friend a drink."" He pointed to the man standing next to her.
The man laughed. ""Not much of a friend if he won't buy me a drink, is he?""
Kip shrugged. ""Perhaps not. But he's a nice guy, so let him buy you a drink.""
The man smiled and nodded.
Cinda's eyebrows rose. ""You're not going to order anything?"" she asked.
He shook his head. ""Not tonight,"" he said. ""We've got work tomorrow. We need our sleep.""
She nodded. ""Well, thank you for your kindness. Maybe you should come by later.""
Kip gave her a big grin. ""I will,"" he promised. ""And I promise to spend every last coin in my pocket just to be with you.""
Cinda smiled back at him. ""Is that a promise?""
He nodded. ""It's a promise."" He leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek.
Her eyes lit up. ""Oh, very well!"" she exclaimed.
Kip took a deep breath, wondering if he would ever see her again after she had gone from the tavern. He glanced at his friend and tried to hide his disappointment.
But that night, the stranger returned to the tavern. She and her companion sat at a table in front of Kip, and they ordered drinks. Kip waited until the man was busy with another customer. Then he walked over to her and touched her hand.
""Hello,"" he said. ""Did you enjoy your drink?""
She pulled away, and her cheeks turned pink. ""Yes, thank you,"" she answered. ""Your friend was quite kind to offer. Thank you for coming to the rescue.""
He smiled. ""It was my pleasure.""
She looked into his eyes. ""I think you are very brave, coming to see me today. You aren't afraid of me?""
""Afraid? Of course not. Why would I be?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Do you know who I am?""
He shook his head. ""No, but I do know who you are. I don't believe we've met, but I can tell by your eyes.""
""My eyes?"" she asked. ""What does my eye color have to do with anything?""
He chuckled. ""I told you, I know who you are.""
She tilted her head to the side, studying him. ""How do you know who I am?""
His heart thumped in his chest, and he couldn't help but notice how her fingers moved lightly across her mouth as though she was imagining kissing him. ""Because you're the mysterious woman from the tavern.""
She blushed again. ""You mean … ?""
""Yes, the one who sat at the table in front of me.""
A flicker of embarrassment passed over her face. ""I'm sorry. I didn't realize you would remember us from such a short time ago. You probably think I'm some sort of strange lady who frequents taverns.""
""No, no! It's just that …"" He paused, trying to find the right words. ""It seems like I saw you somewhere before. Perhaps in a dream. That's all. Just a dream.""
She studied him carefully. ""Where did you see me before?""
He squirmed. ""In a dream.""
""You saw me in a dream?""
He nodded.",1127,0.8001770548703305,-0.21178075958094844,-1.5814271980393368,-0.8812324633385342,0.5905978209962868
266,R_2Scc5AaI8ByUObC,LOW_HOR_4,Horror,Low Rider,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The man's mouth moved as if he were about to say something. Then another head popped through the mirror.
""Help,"" said the second person in my dream. ""You have to help us."" It had been three days since I met them. They hadn't told me their names or where they were staying; only that I was to follow them wherever they went so I could help save a life. They wouldn't tell me any more than that, but when you see someone die in front of you like I did, you can never forget it. That's what happened last night. A guy came running down the street toward an alley and stopped right before he turned around to look at something behind him. In an instant, he ran straight into one of those monsters that you sometimes see out at night. Before I knew it, everything had disappeared except for blood splattering across the concrete. It all happened so fast. I was frozen with fear. My hands were shaking so much that I dropped the flashlight that was strapped to my waist. It hit the ground hard and cracked.
""What is happening?"" I asked myself. I didn't know who the people were. How do you know somebody just by seeing their face? Maybe they're friends of mine and they've come here looking for me.
The next morning, I found the flashlight. Someone must have picked it up and brought it back to me. It was still broken and no longer worked. I left it lying on the floor. Then, I started thinking maybe I should leave town for awhile and find somewhere else to live. But, that's not easy for me because of my mother. She needs someone around to take care of her, but she also has a habit of getting herself into trouble. I guess you could say I'm always stuck between two bad decisions.
When I got home, I heard the TV turn on. Mom was already awake and watching it in the living room. I put my bag down next to the couch and took off my shoes while trying to catch the sound of what she was watching. I couldn't get any information from the static. Finally, it came clear that it was a news report about the monster attacks. The anchorwoman talked about how a woman had survived the attack and was being treated at the hospital now.
My mom turned off the TV. ""Did you hear?"" she asked. ""It's all over the news. A group of students got attacked by the monsters. One of them managed to run away. We're lucky that this lady came back alive.""
""What?"" I asked her. ""What are you talking about?""
Mom stood up, opened the refrigerator, and took out a carton of milk. ""I read it in the newspaper today. There was an article in the paper about it. This girl was walking down the street near school when these things appeared out of nowhere. She saw them coming at her, but they were moving so fast that she wasn't able to outrun them. They caught up to her and dragged her into an alley. She fought them as best she could until she lost consciousness, then they finished her off.""
That really scared me, but I didn't say anything back. What would I say? How does a daughter respond to news like that? All I could do was think of how she could have survived. How did she get away? Did she kill one or more of them before getting away?
""They're hunting people, Mom,"" I said. ""People don't go missing every day without some sort of reason.""
""Maybe they got sick from eating bad food,"" she offered. ""Some of those kids might be sickly and weak from malnutrition.""
""No,"" I answered. ""These weren't normal people. These things aren't human, and they shouldn't even be allowed to live. They shouldn't be here in our world. They should just disappear into the darkness and be forgotten. The government should do whatever it takes to get rid of them. They shouldn't be allowed to keep attacking innocent civilians!""
""You sound crazy, dear,"" my mom said. ""There's nothing we can do about it. You don't need to worry about it, okay?""
I tried telling her the truth. If there's anyone who would believe me, it would be Mom. Unfortunately, she wasn't going to listen unless there was proof. And I couldn't provide it. I had no way of proving that monsters really existed. So, I kept quiet instead of arguing back and just walked upstairs to my bedroom. I closed the door behind me and went over to my desk and sat down in front of my computer, which was connected wirelessly to my TV set. I opened my web browser and typed in the address for the website called Monster-Earth.org.
It took about five minutes before the screen displayed. On it was a huge image of an alien looking creature, its eyes shining brightly beneath black holes with white rings circling around them. The image was so large that I wondered if it was a picture taken from outer space and zoomed in on this planet for us to see. There was no title on the image, but there was a message below it that read: ""This is what you'll see if you go to your nearest monster attack location, so keep your eyes open and be careful!"" The message ended with a link to the site's homepage.
I clicked on it and began reading through the contents of the website. Some parts were written in English, while other parts were in different languages. I figured the author probably wanted to spread his information to as many people around the globe as possible, so they could all learn about what was happening. The more people who were informed, the better chances they would have at surviving an attack. It was almost like a game of survival, and if you wanted to make it all the way to the end of this journey, you needed to be prepared. That meant knowing exactly what to do, and being aware of everything around you. That was why the website contained such detailed information. It was designed to teach people how to survive a monster attack and how to protect themselves against them, so the people living near each attack location would know exactly how to avoid being attacked. The author didn't want anyone to get hurt or killed. He made sure everyone knew that monsters weren't dangerous. They just wanted to live their lives peacefully and without hurting others. That was their main goal. Monsters only ever attacked humans who were doing harm to others in the same way that humans did when they harmed one another. That was it. If you stayed out of their way, they'd stay out of yours. It was that simple. But, unfortunately, most people didn't understand the difference between a monster and a human, so the author wanted to explain it to them.
The author of Monster-Earth was a man named Dr. Thomas H.",1238,-0.5800099111251624,-0.4591495309480475,-0.4889575370946632,-1.2605539525419136,0.3098910113992569
267,R_3O2HKaF3aNCQAk6,ALL_HOR_5,Horror,All-Nighter,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a man's face and he had no eyes. The skin was dark blue, like someone had thrown paint on it. His hair was long and gray. He wore black clothing that had been ripped off him in a struggle.
The face spoke through the mirror. ""Hello, son. It is nice to finally meet you.""
I screamed when I realized what it meant. My father had died in a car crash five years ago and this man was his ghost. He knew who I was, but didn't know my name.
""Please,"" he said, ""don't be afraid of me.""
""But I'm not!"" I yelled at him.
He smiled and nodded. ""Of course, I understand you are new to this sort of thing. I will explain everything once we get started. You can call me Mr. Smith.""
I shook my head. ""You're dead! How do you know who I am?""
Mr. Smith sighed. ""It is hard for me to explain, son. Let me start with a little history.""
He began to speak, telling me about how he died and where he came from. He explained that he had died because of the accident on the highway, which was why his body was found by a local farmer. He told me that the farmer buried him and left flowers at his grave.
When I heard all this, I was shocked. Mr. Smith was my dad? But what did that mean for me? What does it mean to be a ghost? Is he going to haunt me or something?
He took a deep breath and looked at me. ""Now that we have covered that, let me tell you about your future. You will be fine. I will look after you until you find a way to deal with this problem.""
""How am I supposed to deal with it?"" I asked, feeling confused. ""I don't want to be a ghost!""
Mr. Smith chuckled. ""Well, it isn't that bad, son. In fact, you may like it here. We can spend time together if you like.""
I didn't like the sound of that. ""What do you mean?""
""Your father is in love with you,"" Mr. Smith said as he stood up and walked towards me. He was only an inch away from me when he spoke. ""In fact, he loved you very much.""
My heart was pounding in my chest. ""I don't understand what you mean!""
""You see, I was a soldier who served your father long before you were born. I was part of his platoon and I fought along side him. He was one of my closest friends. After I was killed in battle, I was given the opportunity to return to life if I agreed to serve him in this afterlife.""
""But how could that be possible?"" I asked, still confused.
""Your father was the only one who could save my soul. He gave me a chance to live again.""
I felt a chill run up my spine. ""But why would he do that? He doesn't know me! Why would he help me?""
Mr. Smith smiled. ""He did it because he knew you would make a better person. He was right. You are a good boy, aren't you?""
I nodded. ""Yes, sir.""
He patted my head and smiled. ""Good. Now, I need you to listen carefully to everything I tell you. I will guide you through your new life and give you the knowledge you need to survive. You have a lot of responsibilities now. Don't worry; I'll teach you all that you need to know. If you follow the rules, then everything will go smoothly for us both. Is that clear?""
""Yes, sir,"" I said, not sure if I could believe him or not.
He looked at me sternly and then smiled again. ""Now, let's get started. First, you must learn how to use your abilities. Once you master those, then I will explain how to control the rest of your power. It is going to be a lot to learn, so don't expect to figure everything out immediately. But we can start now. Go ahead and try to move something.""
""Okay,"" I replied. I closed my eyes and concentrated. Then I reached out and grabbed Mr. Smith by the shoulder.
His body began to shake as he yelled in pain. ""What are you doing?"" he shouted.
""I'm trying to move you!"" I told him. ""Can't you feel it?""
He nodded slowly. ""I can feel it, but I can't stop it!""
""You can't?""
""No."" He sighed and shook his head. ""It feels like I am being pulled apart.""
""Then let me show you how it works,"" I said as I reached out towards him again. ""Try to grab me again.""
This time, he didn't resist. When I felt him pull, I grabbed on tight. ""See? You just have to hold on tight until you learn how to control it.""
""How long will this take?"" he asked.
I shrugged. ""As soon as I figure out how to control it, I can teach you.""
He frowned. ""What happens if I can't learn to control it?""
""Then I'll be stuck here with you until someone finds me.""
""That isn't going to happen,"" he said. ""You will be able to do this. I know that you will.""
I laughed nervously. ""Maybe you're right.""
Mr. Smith smiled and patted my shoulder again. ""Now, let's try something else. Close your eyes and reach out towards the lamp next to your bed.""
""Okay,"" I replied.
I closed my eyes and tried to feel what Mr. Smith was feeling. Then I reached out and touched the lamp. The moment my fingers touched it, it turned on.
""Good job,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Now let's see if we can turn off the light.""
I tried, but nothing happened.
""That's okay,"" he said. ""Just try harder.""
I concentrated as hard as I could. Then, when I thought I was going to pass out from exhaustion, I finally made it happen. I reached out and turned off the light.
""There!"" Mr. Smith shouted as he clapped his hands. ""That wasn't so hard, now, was it?""
""No, sir,"" I replied.
Mr. Smith nodded and looked at me with a smile.",1084,-1.6882851986936218,-1.6027519995845043,-0.68959531687665,-0.15687578502446312,-1.6090803799991036
268,R_3DwEMa2vKzHTFQ8,LOW_HF_7,High Fantasy,Low Rider,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""This is what we're looking for?"" Kari asked as she walked down the dirt road leading toward the town's gate. ""I don't see anyone.""
Kari followed after her companions, who had come out of the wagon ahead of them. ""Maybe this isn't the best time for you to visit,"" she said. ""Or maybe there aren't any people around because they know the king's soldiers are coming.""
""If that were the case,"" said Vlora, ""then I'd think we should find the king already, wouldn't you?""
They made their way to the front entrance of the village, which was guarded by two men wearing heavy chain mail and carrying spears at the ready. They both eyed them suspiciously as they approached. As soon as Kari stopped in front of them, one stepped forward and spoke to her. She couldn't understand his thick accent but understood him well enough when he started speaking again. He pointed toward her and said something about a dragon, though she didn't catch it all. He motioned back toward the other man and said something else, then waved Kari and her group forward and opened the gate for them.
The gates closed behind them before Kari turned her attention to the village proper. The streets were empty except for some scattered refuse, and most buildings seemed to have been abandoned long ago. A few of the larger structures still showed signs of being inhabited once upon a time; the roof of a large house had collapsed completely while others had fallen in halfway. She looked across to the tower on the northern edge of town and could see that the stone structure had also suffered some damage but wasn't completely gone. There was little doubt in her mind that the people who had once lived here had fled during the siege at the city of Alik'shan. Kari looked down the length of the road, taking in everything around them.
""How do we get to King Zavyr?"" Kari asked as she turned back toward the men.
One of the guards shrugged and said, ""You can't. Not anymore."" He motioned back over his shoulder with an open hand as if asking for silence, then whispered to Vlora and Gifford. ""It's too dangerous.""
""Dangerous? What kind of danger?"" Gifford asked quietly as Kari nodded for him to follow suit.
""There's a dragon here,"" the guard replied softly. He looked around to make sure no one else was close enough to overhear them, then said more loudly, ""A very powerful one that killed everyone who came here after us. We thought it was dead, but now… Well, I guess it must have found shelter somewhere nearby. The only reason we're still alive is because we left it alone.""
Gifford and Vlora looked at each other. Vlora shook her head as she looked away. ""Well, I'll be damned.""
Kari turned to look at Vlora, who shrugged and sighed.
""Is there a place I can rest?"" Gifford asked, looking around as if afraid someone might be watching them.
""Sure,"" said the guard, pointing at a house near the edge of town and saying something else that Kari couldn't understand. He gestured to the building with an open palm, then turned and ran off into the crowd before she could ask him to repeat himself. Kari turned back to Vlora, who was staring at her curiously.
""What's wrong?"" she asked.
""That guard said he heard a dragon. I'm not surprised. But why would you be worried about dragons now?""
""Because the gods told me to kill them,"" Kari said quietly. ""And I haven't seen one yet since I've gotten here.""
""So, what?"" Vlora asked. ""Do you think they were talking about some mythical creature that doesn't actually exist? Or do you think it's just another trick?""
Kari let out a sigh as she watched the guard return from inside the empty building, carrying a sack of supplies with him. ""Vlora, you're going to have to trust me on this. You saw what happened with the kwarrasti queen – and you even got bit by a dragon yourself. That was no myth. This isn't some random encounter or coincidence. I think something is trying to tell us where that monster is hiding.""
""We could take a boat across the lake,"" Vlora offered, nodding toward the far side of the village. ""I don't think I'd care to meet that monster in a fight, either!""
Kari shook her head. ""I have to go up against whatever that thing is if I want to kill it. I need to know if it's really out here somewhere, so I'll try to talk to whoever's running this place. If I can convince them to help me, maybe we can work together. Otherwise, we can always get a boat and cross over later, when things are safe again.""
She started walking toward the door of the nearest building, wondering if the old guard had lied or was simply mistaken.
They found the guard outside, sitting down with his back to the door and apparently having a nap. He awoke when he noticed they were standing nearby, and stood up to welcome them. The man was clearly much older than the young soldier that had spoken to Kari, with deep lines carved into his face and gray hair hanging nearly to the middle of his back. His clothes were simple leathers and breeches with a short vest, but he wore several pouches and holsters on his waist and shoulders.
He introduced himself as Hylas and said that he was the village elder, which Kari didn't understand at first. When she looked around, however, she realized that there were none of the other adults living here; only children. There were no men, women, or elderly people present at all. She tried to ask what had happened to them, but no one in the village spoke the language. They pointed to a building farther up the road, however, and Kari understood them better. She wondered if the building was some kind of school or orphanage, and hoped the kids there weren't orphans themselves.
When they reached the building, she recognized it as the inn that they had stayed in before leaving Alik'shan. It had obviously been repaired at some point after their stay, but it still bore signs of age and decay. The wooden planks of the flooring were split and warped, and the roof sagged badly. Kari wondered how many years ago it had last been used.
Hylas led them upstairs to one of the rooms on the second floor and motioned for Kari to enter first. The room was surprisingly nice, compared with what they had seen so far; clean sheets covered the bed, a small fireplace provided heat, and fresh water flowed from a bucket in a corner. She was glad they could get some rest at least until someone returned with news of the dragon, if they were even still alive.
When Kari entered, she discovered Hylas and his son, Ryn, sitting at a table by the fire. Hylas introduced the boy to Gifford and Vlora as he poured wine into three glasses.",1266,-0.11091812719583553,-1.2104020875400228,-1.4408825533952894,-0.7442170332534845,-0.9787238643126538
269,R_Dk1BQOi5odYWxgZ,OUR_HF_7,High Fantasy,Ouroboros,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""A forest?""
Gavin gave her a long look. ""Why? I don't remember forests.""
She rolled her eyes and waved at the buildings before she turned back to him. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""
He ignored her, instead staring off towards the lake as he let out a long breath.
""We can't do anything here,"" he finally said. ""There's no way we can take down those guards and get into that tower.""
Larajin glanced around them again, then pointed to the two towers. ""Those will be our best bet."" She smiled when he frowned at her. ""Don't worry—we won't have to go in there. We'll find an entrance closer to ground level and climb in.""
He narrowed his gaze at her but nodded slowly.
They made their way to the base of one of the towers. The tower itself had been built with a solid base that ran about twenty feet out from the base of the mountain. Above it, a round balcony extended around most of the circumference of the building and jutted out at random intervals. Larajin tried to spot any kind of door or other access point, but nothing appeared obvious.
Gavin moved closer to the wall. He tapped the stone with his hand, looking for a weak point or perhaps even something to hold on to. His fingers pressed into a gap between two stones and he pulled back his hand, looking at it with surprise.
""What is this?""
She moved next to him and ran a hand along the wall. ""This is a door.""
""You're kidding me,"" he murmured, then reached out and touched the stone once more. ""It opens?""
""No, but I think it's meant to be held open."" She pushed at the stone with her hand, then laughed when it swung open without resistance. ""I guess it's magic after all.""
He stepped through and she followed, the door swinging shut behind them.
They were standing in a long hallway with several doors leading off to the sides. Gavin looked at them carefully, taking them all in as he tried to figure out which one might lead to the inside of the tower. They weren't marked by any markings—which meant the door probably opened to some kind of hidden mechanism.
Larajin shrugged and turned away from him. ""So much for your stealth skills.""
He grinned and took another look around before he glanced at the floor.
""There should be some sort of markings here. A symbol or something.""
He stepped over to the nearest door and ran a hand down its surface. Nothing happened, of course, so he turned towards Larajin. She was still waiting for him, her arms crossed.
""Are you sure we can't just walk around? I'm getting hungry.""
She nodded slowly. ""Okay, whatever. But hurry up already. I'll keep watch.""
She started off towards the right while he moved in the opposite direction. He found a door that was similar in appearance and stepped back from it, looking closely at its surface. The pattern appeared to be carved into the wood, but the letters looked more like numbers than letters. He tapped at the door with his finger.
He stepped back from the door and let out a frustrated sigh, then looked down at the markings on the floor again. A few feet away from the door stood another one of the symbols from the first room—only this time it was marked with the letters ""QHV"".
He glanced at the door once more and shook his head. It didn't look like there was anything to do here.
""Why didn't you try that last door?"" Larajin asked as she approached him.
Gavin gave her a dirty look, but held up his hands in surrender.
""Fine. Go ahead.""
She grinned. ""Don't worry. We'll take it down together.""
He rolled his eyes and continued to stare at the door, then shook his head and turned towards the next one. This time he went to the door on the right and repeated the tapping, only this time he switched to the numbers. He repeated this a few more times before turning away.
""What's wrong now?""
He sighed. ""It doesn't work.""
Larajin frowned. ""Try going up instead of down this time,"" she suggested.
Gavin did as she asked, but once again he couldn't make it open. He turned away from the door and started to walk towards the other side of the hallway when he saw her watching him with amusement.
""What?""
She waved her hand at him. ""Come on, just give up already! It's not worth your energy. Let's go back.""
""I'm not giving up yet.""
Larajin laughed. ""I told you it wasn't worth it!""
""But it's still not working. And you're right. There's no point in wasting energy.""
She shook her head and pointed to the door in the middle. ""Try that one. It should be different, but I don't know how much different. Come on.""
He stepped closer to the door and tried one last time to tap it with his finger. This time, though, he concentrated on the number ""QHV"". Once again, nothing happened. He turned back towards the door he'd come out of and looked at the floor, then hissed in frustration and turned towards Larajin.
""Maybe the order matters?""
She frowned at him. ""Are you kidding me? How can you figure something like that out?""
""Let's go back and try it the other way.""
She rolled her eyes but nodded slowly. ""Fine.""
They made their way back to the door on the left and stepped through.
The door opened easily enough, revealing a long hallway that extended into darkness. Gavin stared down the hall and glanced at the door to his right. He couldn't see anything except the walls of the hallway, which were clearly carved out of the stone around them. The air in here was cool and heavy, but the humidity in the air had been noticeably lower than what they'd encountered before.
Larajin walked past him and took off running.
He blinked, then looked back at her with an incredulous look on his face. ""What?""
""I don't want to find out where this leads,"" she told him as she ran away from him. ""Let's get out of here already!""
He frowned and followed after her, catching up to her just outside the door. She grabbed his arm and pulled him close to her.
""Just follow me,"" she hissed in his ear.",1149,0.8350204658760211,0.3208707535042984,-1.3720260755404472,-0.5834711603505945,-0.648659229813005
270,R_1SRUUAArZg8TIKl,OUR_HR_3,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her dark hair was pulled back severely from her face and held there with two pins. Her face was painted heavily in a pale yellow and black that made her look as if she were suffering from leprosy, which she wasn't. The paint looked very odd against her black gown, especially since it was so transparent. He thought she looked like someone who should be serving tea to some old dowager.
She hadn't ordered anything, and neither had anyone else. He was waiting on his employer and two other men. As he watched the newcomer, he knew instantly that she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. She didn't even belong in a tavern; she belonged in a palace, and not just any palace, but a royal one. Even though her dress was plain, the color of her hair was exquisite, and there was something about the way she moved...
He wasn't supposed to notice such things. His father was a priest who had left their village long ago to find a position as a courtier. He'd brought home enough silver coins for all three of them to live comfortably, but his wife didn't have the same expectations. He'd been away so much for years, leaving the family in the care of servants, that she'd started to complain. When he did come home, it was often in a foul temper.
""I'm tired of being treated like a servant,"" she would say. ""And the children are never going to be taken into service when they're older. They need to know how to run a household.""
The boy and the girl were fourteen and thirteen now. They were just old enough to understand what was happening, and their mother's words made them both miserable. The boy went to work in the village's blacksmith shop, while the girl worked for the landowner on his farm. The boy took pride in his job and learned how to be a good blacksmith. The girl took every chance she got to do the chores that weren't hers, and her work was always sloppy. Her employer complained to him constantly.
One day, after the third time he'd heard this particular complaint, he put an end to the girl's mischief. ""If you want a daughter who is a better worker than you are, then I'll leave,"" he said, in a very quiet voice. The girl didn't say a word, but she looked at him as if she'd seen him for the first time.
""We wouldn't be any poorer,"" the woman said, and she reached out to take his hand. ""She's our only child, and we can't afford to lose her.""
For some reason he couldn't explain, he wanted to believe her. So, he told her, ""Then she has to learn to work hard.""
He gave the girl a look of disapproval and turned away, telling himself that it would be a punishment. He hadn't meant for her to stay. But when he returned home two days later, the girl was sitting on the bed, looking at him as if she'd expected him to come back. She smiled, and he couldn't help himself. He thought her smile was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. And he felt so guilty about what he'd done to her, but at the same time he knew that she understood.
""Why did you do that?"" she asked, still smiling.
He shook his head. ""I didn't think...""
""You're not going to punish me?""
He smiled. ""No. You're free.""
She touched his face. ""You know, there's no need to run away from home anymore.""
""Why would I do that?"" he asked, surprised.
""Because we could have each other,"" she said.
""There's someone else there.""
She smiled. ""Oh, yes, I've been meaning to tell you that I'm engaged.""
He stared at her. ""To whom?""
""A soldier,"" she said, and her eyes seemed to say, ""You already know who I mean, don't you? He was in the tavern the day you arrived.""
The girl never explained how they met or who her fiancé was, but she did go with him. After that, he never saw her again. He waited for her every day, but she never came, and then, one morning, the landlord called him into the kitchen. The girl was sitting there, looking very sad and lost. She looked up at him, her eyes brimming with tears. ""I can't marry him,"" she said. ""He wants to kill you.""
He stared at her, horrified. He was only a man, and he couldn't understand why she'd done this to him. It hurt too much. He turned away.
""I had to say something,"" she told him. ""Please forgive me.""
He hadn't known whether to cry or laugh. He thought about telling her that he would leave and that she could come with him. But instead, he just walked out of the kitchen and went back to his work.
His father was shocked when he found out what the girl had done. ""What were you thinking?"" he asked, his voice angry.
The girl's parents had tried to take her home, but she refused to go. ""It was the right thing to do,"" she told him. ""You don't need me now. You can hire servants, and I can get married.""
""No!"" he said. ""I will not let you leave.""
""Then you can stop me,"" she said.
So, they took her to the border and made her cross into the forest. They put an iron chain around her waist, so that she could never come back to the village again. She became one with the woods. The people in the village wondered why she didn't come to see them anymore, but they assumed she must have had another reason for leaving. And if they thought about it at all, they decided that she'd left because of what had happened between her and the man who worked in the tavern.
When the soldier returned from his latest war, the people in the tavern talked about him and wondered how he looked. Some even claimed that he'd changed. There were stories circulating of him stealing the hearts of women and young girls. And then they would talk about the girl who was gone and how strange it was that she hadn't returned to them.
One day, the soldier came to the tavern, and he told the landlord about a woman who was looking for him. He said he knew she wasn't a thief and that she wouldn't be able to hurt him. And the landlord nodded his head and told the girl's story. Then, he asked the soldier if she were his lover.
The man smiled. ""She's more than my lover,"" he said. ""We're going to marry.""
""I hope it's a happy marriage,"" the landlord said. ""It's a pity about the girl, though. I don't think she deserves to suffer anymore.""",1185,-0.7060807579489646,-0.30257820082907094,0.294775182820662,0.1122448968048415,-0.6322652747742751
271,R_6VRGnQcVsIbKOGZ,FAN_HR_7,Historical Romance,Fandango,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He hadn't recognized her at first, not until she spoke to the man beside her. Then it all came back to him-the day she had saved his life. The same day he'd lost hers.
Now she was here again, in the village where he lived, the very village that he hated because she had lived there, too. It made no sense. She must have moved away after the fire burned their family home, after he'd left to find work in another town. He would have remembered if she had stayed behind. But now she was back and he couldn't escape the thought that everything had led up to this moment.
This woman had ruined the rest of his life. Why should he care that she had returned? It would only make matters worse, as though the fire and the loss of his family had not been bad enough. Still . . . she was beautiful.
She looked much younger than he remembered, but she still had a kind of innocence about her eyes. They were large and blue and framed by thick dark lashes. Her skin was flawless, pale almost white, as though she never ventured out in the sun. Her hair was as black as night, the strands twisted up off her head so that only her face was visible, but it fell down over one shoulder and brushed her breastbone. Her dress was simple brown, long enough to touch the ground. There was nothing in it to attract attention, but then, why would she need to attract anyone's attention? She'd never be able to marry anyone in the village because everyone knew what she'd done.
And yet, even knowing all that, she was still very attractive. How could he have let her go? And now he wouldn't be able to stop thinking about her; he would always see her when he closed his eyes. And in his dreams, he would have her again and feel that terrible pain she had caused.
It was the wrong sort of woman for him. She was too innocent, too trusting. The way he felt today—he would never be able to keep himself from using her and then leaving her when he got what he wanted. It went against his nature, but that didn't mean he could control it.
""I'm sorry I kept you waiting,"" she said, coming around the table and dropping into the chair next to him. ""You're sitting on my knee. My name is Isabella.""
He was surprised; she hadn't given him time to reply before she started talking.
He looked at her in surprise. ""Your knee?"" His own voice sounded flat, empty of passion. How could he feel anything toward this woman? He was a rake and she was a saint.
There was a note of challenge in her voice. ""What do you mean?""
He shook his head. How could she possibly want him? What she did was wrong. Wasn't it, though? Everyone else seemed to think so. But he wasn't going to argue. He was a rake, and he had been raked.
Isabella smiled. ""I'm sorry if I've offended your sense of propriety. It's just that I don't want you to think I'm trying to seduce you, or any such thing. I don't want to frighten you.""
""Why would you do something like that?"" he asked. He had to know. She was too intriguing a creature for him not to want to hear her story. He was still young and strong and virile. Why shouldn't he enjoy a little diversion before he married someone proper and settled down to raise children?
Her brow furrowed. ""That's what you're wondering, isn't it? That's why I asked you to meet me here. I thought you might ask that question. It's important that I answer it.""
""I'm not sure I understand.""
She smiled a bit shyly. ""When you asked to see me, it wasn't so much out of desire, although that helped, I suppose. I didn't plan this when I first met you.""
""You planned on seducing me?"" He laughed, but there was nothing funny about his laughter. It was just a release, to get rid of the pain.
""I didn't plan on having my hand burned.""
""But you still came to see me.""
""Yes.""
""Why?""
""I don't know,"" she admitted.
He shrugged. If she'd had her hand burned because of him, what did that matter? It wasn't as though she would remember anything once he left her.
""I wanted you to tell the village that I'm not a witch."" She spoke almost hesitantly, as though afraid he would somehow know who she was.
""So that's what it was all about?""
She nodded.
He looked at her and suddenly realized how strange their relationship had been up to this point. There had been an attraction between them the first time he'd seen her, before she saved his life. They seemed to have some sort of understanding, as if they'd known each other from somewhere before this, but neither of them had spoken a word to the other until the night of the bonfire.
They had never actually shared a conversation. He couldn't remember what she had looked like and she couldn't remember how he had looked. There had been a bond between them, though, an intangible something that was there whenever they were together. Now it was broken.
""All right. Tell them whatever you want.""
""Thank you."" She seemed embarrassed.
He looked around. This wasn't a place to talk. There were too many people here, listening to every word. ""Let me buy you a drink,"" he suggested. ""We'll talk more privately later on.""
She smiled. ""That would be wonderful.""
They stepped into the bar and ordered drinks. They were served by two girls who were serving beer and ale to some customers. As they waited for their drinks, the girl with the empty pitcher leaned over the counter.
""Hey, Isabella,"" she called to her. ""Did you know there's a big snake in your garden?""
Isabella laughed, as though it was funny. ""I'm not sure. Do we have a snake in our garden?""
""Yeah. It's huge, bigger than a wolf. It's been in the yard for three days now. You better check on it.""
Isabella laughed again. ""That's funny. Thanks for the warning, though. Maybe you should tell Mr. Jenkins about it.""
The girl looked confused. ""What do you mean?""
""Mr. Jenkins lives right next door to you."" Isabella smiled at the girl.",1116,-0.5154023686761937,-0.1203463491468843,-0.7265391005152666,0.7176812241975222,-0.26910646971435426
272,R_2Eh0yUl1whbnGgd,LOW_HF_3,High Fantasy,Low Rider,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. There were no signs that anyone lived there save for a few wisps of straw left over from the last hay harvest and the faint smell of wood smoke lingering in the air. They had been traveling so long that everyone smelled like smoke now and the villagers who were still alive would probably soon start smoking if they didn't stop somewhere soon.
As they approached the town, the first thing that caught his attention was the riverbank itself. It seemed to have been recently cleared of debris but he could not tell whether this was because people were coming back after being driven away or merely because whoever controlled the land hadn't cared enough about the appearance of their home to make an effort to keep it clean. Either way, there was little evidence that any one person had ever owned anything here. It was more akin to a large cave than a house; tall and thick and made entirely of rock rather than wood or stone. The houses on either side were similar in size and shape but different in construction. One appeared to be a wooden structure while the other was more like a tent made of leather and fur. Both buildings appeared to be well-made and sturdy even if they looked as though they were constructed using simple tools rather than magic.
""Do you think the people of this place can help us?""
He looked up at her. ""I'm not sure, Lyrna. I don't see what we can do if they are unwilling to let us stay.""
She smiled at him. ""You're right, but maybe they haven't noticed yet that we are travelers. If we can get a good night's rest and then leave before dawn, perhaps it will work out okay.""
It seemed to him that she had come up with this idea on purpose. He had always found it amusing how her ideas tended to change based upon whatever she was doing. Sometimes, she acted like an older sister, giving him advice and telling him what to do while at other times, she acted like a lover, encouraging him to relax and enjoy himself. Today, however, he sensed that she was simply trying to find the best solution possible and so he did his best to ignore it as the three of them went down a dirt path toward the village.
They entered the center of town through a gate flanked by two guards. The gates were solid and strong looking, built out of thick timber and iron bars. The walls surrounding the town were also very sturdy although they looked as though they might be made out of stone rather than wood. This wasn't surprising since the mountain they stood atop was covered in rocks of various sizes. At their feet, they saw a single man working on something inside the largest house, his back turned to them. They walked up behind him and waited until he turned around. His face was hidden under a hood pulled low over his head but his clothes were well made and he smelled faintly of smoke. When he turned, he stared at the women and then turned away again without speaking.
Lyrna spoke to the old man who stood before the gate. ""My name is Lyrna of the Dvergar clan of the Forestfolk and these are my friends, Gwyn and Alusair. We've just arrived here from another village but we need help because our horses are sick and we cannot continue on by ourselves. Would you please help us? Please?""
The old man frowned. ""I see."" He looked at them closely. ""Are you certain your men aren't diseased?""
Alusair laughed. ""Of course not! Why would you think that?""
The old man nodded slowly. ""I suppose not. Perhaps it is only that I have seen such things before.""
He looked back at them with a serious expression and then pointed at his own eyes. ""If you want me to help, then tell me what you know of the sickness that has been spreading throughout these lands. Do you know why it happens?""
Alusair shook her head. ""I've heard stories that it is caused by demons or something terrible and I have even seen a demon myself but that was before I met you and your kind."" She held her hands out. ""I am sorry if I offended you but it is true. Before I met you, I knew nothing of demons but now I know that the world is much bigger than I thought and that there are many kinds of people in it. That is what makes it exciting!""
Gwyn smiled at her. ""It's nice to hear you say that because it means that you understand the importance of knowing about those outside your own group. We have learned much from other groups and tribes. It is important to share our knowledge and learn theirs.""
The old man looked at each of them in turn. ""That is true and I believe that I can help you. Tell me about your beasts. What sort of creatures were they?""
Alusair took a deep breath and started to explain everything they had been able to discover about the strange plague affecting the horses, sheep, and cattle. When she was finished, the old man looked at her with a stern expression.
""So it appears that it is a disease spread by demons rather than a natural occurrence or a curse cast by a god. It would appear that the gods care very little about human life in this region."" He looked at her. ""You said that you have seen a demon?""
She nodded. ""Yes, I did. In fact, I fought one once and it nearly killed me.""
The old man looked at her skeptically. ""Is that so?"" He paused and then pointed to his own eye. ""Tell me, girl. Do you see the mark of a demon upon my face? I would have expected to see one there given all that you have told me about demons and curses.""
Alusair laughed. ""No, but then again, I wouldn't expect to find a demon in a small village in the middle of nowhere either.""
The old man nodded. ""True enough. You must have been very close to the demon if you saw it clearly enough to recognize it."" He sighed and shook his head. ""But I don't suppose it matters much anymore. Even if there was some truth to what you said, it is unlikely that anyone would be willing to help us now unless we are desperate enough for food or medicine that we would eat or drink poison in order to survive.""
Lyrna looked at him in surprise. ""What do you mean?""
Gwyn answered before the old man could respond. ""Look at the village."" He gestured at the houses and then to the fields that stretched out around them. ""We have seen similar things in many places across the land. A few of these houses appear to be lived in but they are not tended as often as they should be. Most of the crops have withered and died leaving only weeds behind which will grow even less quickly since the soil is depleted. Some people here seem healthy but most do not, and those who do are too weak to help us much. There is a reason that people like us tend to stick together despite all that divides us.""",1315,0.27174256061998064,0.08888216895143575,-1.0432933932342798,-0.9872358640661879,-0.3294737230315843
273,R_2dz0opdwfKY8uYH,OUR_HOR_2,Horror,Ouroboros,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't mine; it was one that I had never seen before. I knew that it didn't belong there because I couldn't recognize it. That was why it had frightened me. It scared me to no end when I realized that I hadn't put it there. There was nothing inside my head that could have done this. There wasn't any curse or spell cast upon me that would have made me do that to myself in the first place. So then who was it? Who had done it?
When I finally found my voice, I called out ""Who's there?"" but still no one answered me. In fact, no one could answer me. This was something new entirely and I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. If the mirror were to speak, then it would only say nonsense. I know this because when I called out for help, not even an echo returned. Even if someone had heard me calling out, they wouldn't be able to find me because I wasn't anywhere to be seen. Not even a single piece of hair was there as proof that I ever existed. My whole body was covered in nothingness. This made me think that maybe whoever this was, they knew more than they were letting on about their identity. They wanted to keep themselves hidden for whatever reason, which was making everything even more confusing and bizarre.
I kept staring at the mirror waiting for someone to come out of it so that we could start talking, but there was no one else to be seen. It was just me standing there staring at the mirror wondering where I would go next. What would I do now? Would I stay here forever? Was there a way that I could get back home to where everyone was and live a normal life again? It felt like everything was closing in around me, leaving me no choice but to give up on the thought of going home. Then suddenly, my reflection started moving and turned its face toward me. It stared into the glass with empty eyes.
""Don't you recognize me?"" asked my reflection in a cold voice. ""Aren't we friends? Aren't we together?""
It sounded almost like it was pleading, but I wasn't quite sure what that meant or why it would sound that way. I wasn't quite sure how I could trust anything it said either because I didn't know who it really was. It had already gone too far for me to be able to believe anything it said anymore. Maybe it was one of those people that used their voices to disguise themselves. I don't know what they're called. I had heard of them before, but I couldn't tell if this person was one of them. I could only think about the words that it spoke.
""What happened?"" asked the voice. ""Why are we separated? How come I can't see you?""
""What's wrong?"" I asked in response. ""Are you hurt?""
My reflection started moving around in front of the mirror as it began speaking more loudly. ""Is this some kind of joke? Why is my body all alone in here? Have I gone insane? No, I don't think so! This has to be a nightmare!""
I kept staring at my reflection and waited for an answer, but there was nothing that came back to me. I had never been in such a situation before. I wasn't quite sure what to do. I didn't want to talk to myself because I knew that it wouldn't help. That was what had gotten me into this mess in the first place. There was no point in talking to myself. I looked back up at the mirror again, still hoping for a miracle. But all it had in response were tears. It continued to cry and weep without giving me any answers as to why I was being left out of what was going on. I felt like I should be the one crying instead because I had lost everyone I knew and loved, but I didn't. Instead, I just stood there in silence staring at the glass. I didn't know what else to say or do, which left me feeling even more confused. Then, when I turned around to look at the other side of the mirror, it wasn't there anymore. The only thing that was there was a cloud of smoke that was floating there. When I moved closer to the mirror to try and see inside of it, my reflection didn't seem to notice. I don't know what to make of it yet. Maybe I'll figure something out later, but until then I have to go back to where I'm staying. I think it's time that I tried to find out what this mirror is supposed to be for. It was too strange for me to ignore. If anything else strange happens, I'm sure that I'll figure it out then. For now, I guess I'll start from the beginning.
I was walking down the street heading toward my house when I suddenly saw an old lady fall and lose her balance. She fell right onto the ground in front of me. I helped her up by putting my arms under her armpits. When I did, I noticed that her skin was dark like pitch. In fact, she had a face that was almost as black as charcoal. It looked almost like she had been carved out of coal. As soon as she came back to her senses, she started asking me some weird questions that I didn't understand. Her voice sounded as though it belonged to a person that was dead. At least that's how I felt about it anyway. She asked me if I could see my reflection and if we were friends. I told her that I couldn't answer any of those questions because I didn't know the answers myself. The only thing I knew for certain was that I wasn't dreaming or anything. She told me not to worry because I wasn't crazy and neither was she. I kept looking at the old lady's reflection to see what would happen and all of a sudden it vanished from my sight. That left me more confused than I already was. I figured that maybe she was just one of those people that used their voices to disguise themselves so that they could hide themselves better. Then, she began talking about something else.
""Do you want to play?"" she asked me.
I was confused. I couldn't understand a word that she said and I was still worried about what had happened to the old woman on the street. ""I can't understand you,"" I answered back to her in a panic. ""Can you speak properly please?""
My reflection didn't seem to care one bit and continued to talk to me without getting upset about it. ""Play?"" she repeated. ""What do you mean by 'play'?""
She took a step forward toward me and pointed right into my face. I tried to keep her away from me by moving backward, but she kept coming closer. When she spoke again, I heard a voice coming out of her that was much deeper than before. It was like she was trying to imitate something and ended up sounding more like an animal instead. I didn't know what it was that I was hearing, but I knew that I didn't want anything to do with her. All I wanted was to get as far away from her as I possibly could. My reflection suddenly grabbed me by the throat and began shaking me around. I looked into its eyes and saw that they were completely black.",1340,0.503242132065466,-0.2933100179378801,-0.9750861727819544,-0.972835297192325,0.40688515657732444
274,R_6XtpyqTABUEyypH,GEN_HR_4,Historical Romance,Genesis,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He had been working on cleaning up the beer spilled by some of the drunks who came in before closing. The girl's gaze had locked onto him as she sat there drinking what looked to be a cup of wine. A man stood behind her, a tall, handsome fellow with dark hair and bright eyes. For a moment he thought it might have been an escort, but when he spoke to the woman and turned his back to the room, Kip realized that this must be the mysterious stranger. The two were talking quietly. Kip heard only bits of their conversation. It seemed they were both searching for someone. When the man rose from his seat, the girl followed him out of the tavern without looking back at Kip or saying anything more to him.
This encounter had happened several weeks ago, but it still haunted Kip's dreams. He couldn't get the image of the woman out of his mind. Her long brown hair fell over her shoulders and down her back. His fingers itched just thinking about brushing through those soft strands. And her eyes—he could see himself buried beneath them for days. They were a pale gray color, almost silver.
Kip knew he was no good for anyone. He was not wealthy; he wore cheap clothes because he couldn't afford better ones. He wasn't particularly handsome. In fact, most people would probably describe him as plain. But he did have a certain charm. He was tall, strong, and quick-witted. He also had a great sense of humor. He didn't take life too seriously. People liked him. That's why his father had sent him here in the first place.
He rubbed his hands together nervously. It had been five years since he arrived in this city, and he hadn't found a job yet. But he didn't really care about that. What he wanted was to meet someone like the mysterious woman who'd walked into the bar. Not someone like his father or mother, whose marriages were miserable and ended in divorce. Or someone like his brother, who married the wrong woman and lived a joyless life. No, what Kip had been hoping for all these years was to find someone like the mysterious stranger from the tavern. Someone beautiful and smart and strong enough to stand beside him against everything.
At least he had met one person like that once. He had been twelve at the time, and her name was Cinda. She had loved animals like he did, and she had teased him mercilessly, even when they weren't alone. He remembered how her smile would light up the whole world around him. The way he felt when he saw her had made him feel as if nothing else mattered anymore.
So when he saw her again, sitting at the same table in the tavern, he was ecstatic. If she recognized him, he was sure he would lose his chance forever. He had to act quickly. He had to speak to her before she left. If he could get close to her, maybe somehow convince her that she should stay here with him, then perhaps he would finally have a chance to show her what life was supposed to be like.
""I'll buy you another drink,"" Kip said loudly.
She looked up at him, and her eyes widened slightly. ""Are you offering me a bribe?"" she asked in a throaty voice.
He grinned. ""No, I'm buying my friend a drink."" He pointed to the man standing next to her.
The man laughed. ""Not much of a friend if he won't buy me a drink, is he?""
Kip shrugged. ""Perhaps not. But he's a nice guy, so let him buy you a drink.""
The man smiled and nodded.
Cinda's eyebrows rose. ""You're not going to order anything?"" she asked.
He shook his head. ""Not tonight,"" he said. ""We've got work tomorrow. We need our sleep.""
She nodded. ""Well, thank you for your kindness. Maybe you should come by later.""
Kip gave her a big grin. ""I will,"" he promised. ""And I promise to spend every last coin in my pocket just to be with you.""
Cinda smiled back at him. ""Is that a promise?""
He nodded. ""It's a promise."" He leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek.
Her eyes lit up. ""Oh, very well!"" she exclaimed.
Kip took a deep breath, wondering if he would ever see her again after she had gone from the tavern. He glanced at his friend and tried to hide his disappointment.
But that night, the stranger returned to the tavern. She and her companion sat at a table in front of Kip, and they ordered drinks. Kip waited until the man was busy with another customer. Then he walked over to her and touched her hand.
""Hello,"" he said. ""Did you enjoy your drink?""
She pulled away, and her cheeks turned pink. ""Yes, thank you,"" she answered. ""Your friend was quite kind to offer. Thank you for coming to the rescue.""
He smiled. ""It was my pleasure.""
She looked into his eyes. ""I think you are very brave, coming to see me today. You aren't afraid of me?""
""Afraid? Of course not. Why would I be?""
She looked at him curiously. ""Do you know who I am?""
He shook his head. ""No, but I do know who you are. I don't believe we've met, but I can tell by your eyes.""
""My eyes?"" she asked. ""What does my eye color have to do with anything?""
He chuckled. ""I told you, I know who you are.""
She tilted her head to the side, studying him. ""How do you know who I am?""
His heart thumped in his chest, and he couldn't help but notice how her fingers moved lightly across her mouth as though she was imagining kissing him. ""Because you're the mysterious woman from the tavern.""
She blushed again. ""You mean … ?""
""Yes, the one who sat at the table in front of me.""
A flicker of embarrassment passed over her face. ""I'm sorry. I didn't realize you would remember us from such a short time ago. You probably think I'm some sort of strange lady who frequents taverns.""
""No, no! It's just that …"" He paused, trying to find the right words. ""It seems like I saw you somewhere before. Perhaps in a dream. That's all. Just a dream.""
She studied him carefully. ""Where did you see me before?""
He squirmed. ""In a dream.""
""You saw me in a dream?""
He nodded.",1127,0.8128365805857088,0.07810098628372826,0.30552552867600485,0.7958249403834858,1.0226253071821823
275,R_1QtlVZX6GozE8w0,MOR_HR_9,Historical Romance,Morpho,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The tavern was almost empty, with only a few patrons scattered around the room. She was a young, pretty thing, perhaps nineteen or twenty years old. She wore a plain brown skirt and a white blouse with a blue ribbon at her neck. A small purse hung from her shoulder. He could see that she had auburn hair and green eyes.
She was young, but she was beautiful, and he knew at once that he would love her. He didn't say anything to the young man who brought him his ale, but he had been watching her for a while, and he knew that she didn't belong there. He watched her for a while longer, thinking about what he would do when the tavern closed and she left. As it turned out, she was the only person to remain in the tavern after everyone else had left. He watched her closely as she drank her ale. He was fascinated by the way she moved. She looked so delicate, so graceful. He could see her clearly even though the room was dark and his eyesight was poor.
He wondered how she could possibly be there by herself. She didn't fit the tavern's usual clientele; no one like her came there. No one like her ever had. He tried to imagine how it could be that she had ended up in the tavern of all places. It just didn't make sense.
He thought about asking her about herself, but decided against it. He had never been very good at conversation, and he wasn't sure that he would have been able to carry on a conversation with her anyway. He was too shy, too awkward, and he didn't have the proper words to use in conversation. All he could think of to say was that she seemed so unusual for someone who had ended up in the tavern.
He knew that if he were to say that to her, she might just laugh at him, although he wasn't sure what kind of a reaction he would get from her if she actually did laugh at him. He would probably be embarrassed at having spoken to her at all, which would probably make him even more awkward than before. But he had to say something to her; he couldn't just let such a lovely woman sit there by herself any longer than he had already let her sit there for. Besides, it was almost time for him to close the tavern for the night, and if she were still sitting there when he closed up shop, he would be forced to stay open longer than usual in order to keep an eye on her. He really didn't think that would be good for business, and he didn't feel right about doing that anyway.
The young woman drank her ale quietly for a while longer. Then she stood up and went outside into the cold evening air. As soon as she stepped outside, she paused and looked around the street. Then she quickly went back inside the tavern and disappeared into one of the back rooms. The young man came back with another ale; the man waved him off before he could pour it down the young man's throat, which was almost empty anyway. Then the man picked up a wooden bowl and went over to a box on one of the tables where the young woman had been sitting earlier in the day. He took some coins from her purse and placed them into the box, then picked up the box and carried it back into his room at the back of the tavern.
The man watched as the young woman stood up and approached him again. She looked frightened; he could see that clearly now that he could see her face clearly in the light from the windows. She looked frightened because he was a stranger to her; she didn't know who he was or where he had come from. She probably thought that he was going to hurt her somehow or do something bad to her. She probably thought that she ought to run away from him right then and there and get away from him as quickly as possible. But she didn't run away; instead, she came closer to him for some reason.
""I'm sorry I scared you,"" he said gently to her as soon as she came close enough for him to see her face clearly without having to squint at her because of what little light there was in the tavern that night. ""I'm afraid I startled you when you came out of your room earlier today.""
The young woman looked up at him curiously, as if she had never seen him before in her life or maybe not even known that he existed before that moment that he had spoken to her inside the tavern earlier in the day. ""It's all right,"" she said softly as she sat down again at one of the tables near him. ""I guess I haven't been spending enough time at home lately.""
""Where are you from?"" asked the young man cautiously as soon as she seated herself once more at the table in front of him. He realized that perhaps his tone sounded too abrupt for his liking but decided not to worry about it right then because it wasn't like it was really his fault anyway, considering how strange he'd felt when she had come out of nowhere earlier in the day and scared him half out of his wits. ""I've never seen you before.""
The young woman shook her head gently again as if she were trying to shake off an unpleasant memory from somewhere deep inside of herself. She looked down at her hands as if they were suddenly completely unfamiliar objects to her. ""I can't remember,"" she said softly as tears filled her eyes once more as they usually did when she thought about where she had come from or who she had been before she'd arrived here in this world or wherever it was that they were now together in this strange place together together in this strange place together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange world together in this strange place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place place situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situation situatio
""Are you sick?"" asked the young man gently as soon as he saw that tears were forming in the corners of her beautiful eyes once more because they usually did whenever she thought about where she'd come from or who it was that might have raised her or brought her here or brought her here or brought her here before this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world or this world

276,R_1ieuSYZZA3nVhQE,GEN_HF_10,High Fantasy,Genesis,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
The road led them past the lake then down a steep incline into the valley beyond where the river bent sharply before flowing away from it. There, a bridge had been built and a large building sat upon it. From this vantage point, one could see that the bridge was made of stone while the building was constructed of brick. It was a simple structure, lacking any ornamentation whatsoever. The walls were white-plastered and there were no windows visible on the first floor, making it look more like a fortress than an inn.
""I don't think we'll find anyone here,"" said Miral as she looked around cautiously. ""This place is certainly not what I expected.""
""That's because you're a princess. They tend to get things wrong when dealing with royalty. We'll have to ask around until someone can help us.""
They walked across the bridge and approached the building. No sooner had they set foot inside than a man appeared before them. He was dressed in red robes and he stood easily as tall as Kari. His long silver hair flowed behind him and his blue eyes seemed to pierce right through them.
""What can I do for you?"" asked the priest without preamble.
Miral turned to face him. ""We need passage eastward.""
The priest nodded. ""Why do you want to go so far? Are you pilgrims heading to the holy city of Eathinian?""
""No, we are headed farther east to the land of the Dragon King.""
""Hmm…"" the priest mused. ""The only way to get there is to journey by boat along the Great Ocean. There is a port town on the southern edge of the sea called Olandis. From there, you will likely have to take a ship down the coast to Othir, which lies in the center of the continent. Once you reach the city, you should look for an inn or tavern known as The Dragon's Claw. Tell them that the royal family sent you and they will provide you with the best accommodations. For a price, of course.""
Kari eyed the priest carefully. ""And why would you know this?""
""My order has ties to the king. I am bound to serve him in whatever capacity he requires.""
""But not as a spy, I hope,"" Kari said.
""Of course not!"" the priest exclaimed. ""We have no interest in spying on your kingdom. All we wish to do is offer our services to those who require them. You may rest assured that if you stay at The Dragon's Claw, you'll receive the utmost discretion. Good day, Princess Miral.""
With that, he bowed once again and vanished back into the building. Miral looked uncertainly toward Kari, and she gave her a reassuring smile. ""He seemed nice enough.""
""Well, we have to trust him somehow,"" Miral replied.
""It seems odd to me that a place like this exists in a world full of dragons,"" Kari noted. ""Doesn't the dragonkin live on the other side of the ocean?""
""Yes, but there are many more humans than there are dragons,"" Miral explained. ""There is also the fact that humans seem to have a connection with the dragons, even though they don't live in the same place. I suppose there might be some sort of mystical bond between them that I'm just too ignorant to understand. Anyway, I've heard stories about the Dragon Kings. Some say they're really dragons themselves, while others suggest that they're simply human kings pretending to be something different in order to fool people. Either way, they're supposed to be very powerful.""
""Sounds like you've done a lot of research on them,"" Kari commented.
Miral shrugged. ""Maybe a little bit. But this is all I know. If we're going to get to Olandis, we'll have to find transportation soon. Do you think we can afford to stay here tonight, or will it cost us?""
Kari pulled out a few coins and counted them. She had brought quite a bit of gold with her from the North, and she'd sold off most of it in Citaria to fund the trip south. Her stash remained, however, and she knew that it would be enough to keep them afloat for a time. She handed Miral a couple of coins and told her to pay for their lodging if they decided to sleep here.
""Let's see what we can learn,"" Kari said. ""If we decide to spend the night here, perhaps we'll have more luck asking around.""
""You think we should stay here, then?""
""I'm not sure,"" Kari admitted. ""We haven't seen any other people and I don't like the feeling I get from this place.""
They went upstairs and found a room on the second floor. It was furnished with a bed and a table with chairs, both of which were made of wood rather than cloth or leather. The room itself was simple, but clean and well kept. As they settled in, Miral turned to Kari. ""Do you believe in spirits?""
""Not particularly,"" Kari said.
""Oh, I thought you might like to hear my story.""
Kari smiled. ""Go ahead.""
""While I was in the capital, I met someone who claimed to have seen a ghost. He said he didn't know whether the spirit was male or female, and that it was wrapped in chains and dragging them along. It came to him while he was walking near the palace.""
""It sounds like a nightmare,"" Kari said. ""Are you sure there wasn't anything else about it?""
""Well, he claimed that it took the form of a woman, but that she was wearing armor, and the armor was covered in blood. She was carrying a sword and shield, and she had no head. I didn't want to be rude and ask how the man knew all this, but it sounded very strange indeed. And it got worse. Apparently, the ghost was watching him from a distance while he talked to a friend and when he turned to leave, it grabbed hold of his leg and dragged him into the shadows. That's when the man ran away and tried to tell everyone what happened, but no one believed him.""
""Did you ever meet this man again?""
""No, but I did ask if I could see the place where it happened. It's a small alleyway, barely wide enough for a carriage to pass through. It's right beside the palace, but few people walk by it. Well, he showed me and it was empty. I don't know what to make of it. I mean, the man's story sounds incredible, but I never saw anything like that myself. Then again, I suppose I wouldn't. There aren't many places in the capital that I don't know of. Maybe it's nothing and maybe it isn't.""
""Perhaps you should consider it a warning,"" Kari suggested.",1210,-0.04457776498351049,-0.4338956852043529,-0.9493211139064508,0.4438064318447614,-0.06470528326835152
277,R_yBWPy0tKj9482MF,ALL_HOR_1,Horror,All-Nighter,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was one I hadn't seen before. He had bright green eyes, black hair, and an ugly scar that ran across his right cheek. His mouth was wide open, as if he were screaming.
I turned my head to the side and saw another face in the mirror. This one had the same scar as the first man. It also had the same wide-open mouth, but this one seemed more excited than the other guy. His eyes were sparkling, almost like a cat's. He looked at me and smiled with perfect white teeth. Then he laughed so hard he had to wipe tears away from his eyes.
The two faces stared at each other for a moment before the first one disappeared. I heard the second man laughing as well and then I felt him crawling under my sheets. He pulled them off of me and threw them on the floor. He then grabbed me by the shoulders and pushed me down onto my knees.
I was terrified, not knowing what was going to happen next. The man crawled out from under the bed and stood up. He looked me straight in the eye and said, ""Don't be afraid.""
""Who are you?"" I asked.
He didn't answer. Instead, he reached out his hand and took mine. Then he led me through the mirror.
When I got to the other side, I found myself in a large bedroom with a king sized bed and a beautiful, four-poster canopy. A huge chandelier hung in the center of the ceiling above the bed and was covered with candles. There was another man sitting in a chair near the fireplace, reading a book. He looked up when he heard me enter the room.
""Well, look who's here,"" he said.
The man I had just met walked over to the other man and shook his hand. They both seemed to know each other very well.
""This is my brother,"" the first man said. ""We call him Jack.""
""Jack, this is my friend,"" the second man said. ""His name is Ben.""
They both looked at me and smiled.
""What's your name, young man?"" Jack asked.
""Ben.""
""My brother and I were hoping that you'd help us out. We need your help.""
""Why do you need my help?"" I asked.
""We want to find someone that we lost many years ago,"" Jack said.
""And who is this person?"" I asked.
""Her name is Anna,"" the first man said. ""She's my wife.""
""How long has it been since you've seen her?"" I asked.
""It's been a while now,"" Jack said. ""But we haven't given up hope that she'll return to us someday.""
""I think I can help you out,"" I said.
""How?"" Jack asked.
""There are things in this world that don't belong here,"" I said. ""They're not from our dimension and they come from another place.""
""That's right,"" Jack said. ""We've been looking for them ever since we lost Anna.""
""I'm sorry about your wife,"" I said. ""But I don't understand what you're getting at.""
""Ben, why don't you show him?"" Jack suggested. ""He's probably more qualified than anyone else on this earth to help us find what we need.""
""Okay, sure,"" I said. ""But where should we start? There are so many places in the world to search.""
""You're right, Ben,"" Jack said. ""There are millions of places that we could look.""
""Well then, why don't we narrow it down a little bit,"" I said. ""Why don't you tell me what kind of place you think Anna is?""
""Do you have any idea?"" Jack asked.
""I guess I don't know her well enough yet,"" I replied.
""How about the forest?"" Jack said. ""That seems like a good place to start.""
""The forest?"" I asked. ""Have you been there?""
""Yes,"" he replied. ""And I've seen many others like it. We found one near a town called New York, and another near the beach.""
""I haven't been to either of those places,"" I said. ""But I've never heard of any forests near either of those areas. And if they existed, I'm sure someone would have told me about them.""
""I agree,"" Jack said. ""So why don't we try to find one here in Texas.""
""Let's go to Texas,"" I said. ""It might be easier to find what we're looking for in a big place.""
Jack and his brother both smiled. Then Jack looked at me and said, ""If you'll come with us, I think we can help you find what you're looking for. And I think we can help you find what you're looking for as well.""
""Okay,"" I said. ""I'm ready whenever you are.""
""Great,"" he said. ""We'll leave right now.""
""But what about my house?"" I asked.
""Don't worry about your house,"" Jack said. ""We'll make sure everything is fine before we go. We won't leave until you say goodbye.""
I got out of bed and put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. The two men came into the room and stood next to each other. They both seemed happy that I agreed to go with them. Then they took my hand and led me out of the bedroom. We went downstairs and I saw my parents sitting at the kitchen table eating breakfast.
""Hi, Mom,"" I said.
""Good morning, Ben,"" she replied.
""Ben, I hope you don't mind if I ask you to go on a little trip today,"" my father said.
""No problem,"" I said. ""Just give me a couple of days to get packed up and I'll be gone.""
""That would be great,"" he said. ""I was hoping you'd come visit your sister and her family soon. Maybe you could bring some friends along this time.""
""I'd love to,"" I said. ""Maybe next month.""
""I'm looking forward to it,"" he replied.
""We'll call you when we get there,"" Jack said. ""And we'll call you every day.""
""Sounds good,"" my dad said. ""Have fun.""
""We will,"" Jack said. ""And we'll be back soon.""
Jack and his brother walked over to me and gave me a hug. They were both taller than me and looked strong enough to take down an elephant. After they left, my mother came over and kissed me on the forehead.

It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature would be around eighty degrees Fahrenheit, with clear skies and not much wind. I could feel some humidity in the air, but I had long gotten used to dealing with it. My clothes were all made from thin synthetic materials that would dry quickly, so there wasn't any reason for me to bring along an umbrella or raincoat.
As I walked down the street toward downtown, I thought about what President Hachiro might want. The last time he summoned us together, it was to inform us that our mission on Mars was being extended for two years. That meant I'd be spending most of my life here until then.
I'm a doctor by trade, specializing in surgery and emergency medicine, but since coming to Mars I've been mostly working as a research assistant for Dr. Sato at the medical laboratory where she has set up shop. She and I are both members of the Mars One project team. We're trying to build up enough supplies and equipment here on Earth that people can stay alive for one year on the planet. But our goal is really just to get people through their first year, which will hopefully lead to establishing a permanent human colony on Mars. If they can survive that long, after that it should only be a matter of time before we can settle into a real routine of living in space. I still don't know how long I'll be able to remain here once my initial assignment ends, but even if I'm stuck on Mars, it looks like I'll be able to live pretty well.
The Martian colony has no money, so we aren't allowed to work for a salary; instead, we receive a monthly stipend that's based on the number of days we've spent here. As of today, I've been on Mars for six months, and according to my records I've earned five thousand and forty-four days' worth of money. So far, my earnings total more than seventy million yen. Not bad for a job that's considered part time, right? And I haven't actually done anything that impressive yet. There are no doctors here, so Dr. Sato has basically turned me into a lab technician who does research.
When I got to the main square of town, the city center known as the ""Plaza,"" I saw Dr. Hachiro sitting at a table on the sidewalk, surrounded by a group of people wearing white protective suits and helmets. He stood up to greet me as I approached, then shook my hand and led me to a nearby café. ""Dr. Hachiro, thanks for meeting with me. I was worried you'd already gone back home.""
""That's not why I asked you to come,"" he replied, taking his seat across the table from me.
I smiled nervously. ""Then, um . . . what did you want to see me about?""
There were several large monitors mounted on the walls behind him, showing a variety of images from all over Mars—satellite views and pictures of the surface taken by rovers. A few of them showed the area where I lived, so I assumed these were photos taken by satellites orbiting the planet.
One man was standing off to the side next to Dr. Hachiro; I hadn't seen him when he arrived, but as soon as I noticed him he began speaking into his earpiece. I couldn't hear what he was saying, but he didn't look too happy.
Dr. Hachiro turned his attention toward the monitor showing the view from Mars. ""You're aware of course that the mission to colonize the Red Planet has been suspended?"" he said quietly. His voice seemed to catch in his throat and break at the end of the sentence.
My stomach tightened. The news had only been announced a few hours earlier, but now that it was actually happening it felt real. Of course I knew it would eventually happen someday, but hearing it said aloud made it seem final.
He sighed and looked at me. ""As you probably know, the president's original plan was to send four hundred settlers to Mars within ten years. Now, because of budget cuts and other issues, they're only sending twenty-three. That means there won't be any new settlers arriving here anytime soon.""
Dr. Hachiro leaned forward and lowered his voice even further. ""In fact, unless things change drastically in the near future, the entire colonization project may be scrapped entirely. That's what I just found out myself. But before that happens, it seems there are a lot of loose ends to tie up here in Japan. I've been told to take care of them.""
I tried to hide my surprise. The mission to colonize the Red Planet is a government program, and the funding for it comes from the Japanese taxpayers, but that doesn't mean I'm personally responsible for its success or failure. All I do here is work in the medical facility, which is funded by the Japanese military. So if they don't need my help anymore, then it shouldn't matter whether or not they keep paying me. Right?
""Well, what's so important that you had to ask me to join you here?"" I asked. ""I'm sure everyone else is already working on their assignments.""
Dr. Hachiro shook his head. ""We have one more person we need to find a place for. That's all.""
This sounded suspiciously like what they told us would happen when we left Earth: Once we arrive on Mars, we'll each have our own specific task to complete in preparation for settling the planet. But it had never really been made clear exactly who would be assigned what jobs. We'd always assumed that everyone on board would pitch in to carry out various duties.
""And how am I supposed to figure out which of those tasks I'm going to be doing?"" I asked.
The president leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms across his chest. ""Well,"" he said, ""it's possible you'll be assigned your own task, but it's also likely that you'll be helping the others with theirs. I think that's better, actually. After all, you know the colony best.""
The man in the white protective suit continued talking into his device. He was still standing beside the president, but now he was looking directly at me. ""Who is this person you wish us to locate?"" he demanded. ""We must determine his or her identity and whereabouts immediately!""
The president glanced back at him sharply. ""What do you mean 'who'?""
""It matters little if we know 'who,' "" the man answered coldly. ""All we need to know is where they are.""
I frowned, feeling uncomfortable with this man's aggressive tone. The president's eyes narrowed, but he said nothing in response. Then he turned back to me and spoke again. ""If the rest of the team doesn't return before the next supply ship arrives from Earth, then I think it's time we find someone new.""
I sat staring straight ahead. There wasn't much I could say right then. I just kept thinking over everything I knew about the mission, trying to make some sense of what was happening. When I realized that no one was saying anything else to me, I started packing up my things to leave. But before I could stand up, Dr. Hachiro put his hand on my arm and gently pulled me back down into my seat.
""Please wait,"" he whispered. ""Let's finish what we came here to do first.""",1315,-0.2844671761898021,-0.7154816741509225,-0.5987916420735973,0.5669361303142165,-0.6083921427541669
279,R_3I0IN19AEPuFayU,MOR_HF_6,High Fantasy,Morpho,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""I thought the name meant that there was a city here,"" said Jirril.
""There's a city, just not one that's accessible by land,"" said Karigan. ""Come on.""
She led them along the shore of the lake, the water lapping at her shoes, and toward the mountains. She knew this area well, having spent several months here as a child, but it had changed quite a bit since then.
""It's beautiful,"" said Jirril.
""Yeah, you'd think it'd be more lively,"" said Grady.
""I don't know what I'd expect from a city called Tethys, but this isn't it.""
They followed her around a bend in the mountain range where trees clung tenaciously to their rocky crags. As they got closer to the water, the sun shone through the trees and Jirril could see that there were people on the other side. She took out her staff and waved it in the air. ""Stop!""
The people looked up and she saw that they were children. A man and woman stood with them.
""What's going on?"" asked Jirril.
""You're not welcome here,"" said the woman. ""Go back.""
""I don't think so,"" said Karigan.
""You're not welcome,"" said the man. ""Go back.""
""We have business here,"" said Karigan.
The man stepped forward and drew his sword, a blade as long as Karigan's arm, and stepped in front of the children. ""Get back.""
Karigan hesitated, then said, ""I'm sorry, but I'm not leaving anyone behind."" She stepped forward and raised her staff. ""Stop."" The sword swung toward her and she dodged it easily. ""Stop.""
The man was much more skilled at swordplay than she was, but he was no match for Karigan's ability to move without warning and to focus her will on her weapon. She struck him in the side of the head and he dropped his sword and fell to one knee, blood gushing from his forehead. The woman screamed and pushed the children behind her until they were behind a tree, then she drew a knife from her belt and held it out at Karigan. ""Get back.""
Karigan shook her head at her stupidity and sent a burst of energy into her staff. The blade shattered and fell to pieces on the ground. The woman screamed again and threw herself at Karigan with her knife raised high but before she could bring it down on Karigan's neck, Jirril pulled her back and away from the woman, who stumbled back against a tree trunk, her arm twisted viciously behind her. A cry escaped from her mouth as she fell to the ground. Karigan felt a stab of guilt, but it was fleeting. She'd had no choice. She turned back to the man who still lay facedown with blood soaking into his tunic and trousers. She walked over to him and he didn't move, so she kicked him in the side of the head to make sure he was dead. He didn't move again.
Jirril knelt beside the woman and rolled her over onto her back so that she could see what had happened to her left arm. She was bleeding profusely from a wound in her upper shoulder that appeared to have severed an artery. She stared up at Jirril with wide eyes before she passed out again, but Jirril didn't leave her side until she had recovered enough to walk back to town herself.
""It wasn't nice to do that for no good reason,"" said Jirril as he walked with her, his long tail dragging behind him on the ground. He looked around in confusion at all of the people who stared at them in silence as they made their way back down the path to town. Jirril's clothes were torn in places and he had dirt under his fingernails where he'd been dragged along the ground and bruised in places where he'd been kicked or hit by rocks when he'd fallen down out of a tree or out of a bush, but he looked no worse for wear than Karigan did except for a few small cuts that were already healing on his face and arms where branches had cut him when he'd fallen from a tree or out of a bush. He looked more like an adventurer who had been in a fight than a wizard who was supposed to be protecting them from harm during their journey along the river valley.
Karigan looked back at him and smiled slightly. ""I told you I'd protect you if you'd help me get back home.""
Jirril nodded. ""But you didn't need to do that for no good reason.""
Karigan couldn't help but feel relieved that Jirril had come with them when he had helped them get to where they were going without being asked. He had fought for them when he didn't have to, even though he knew it meant certain death for him if he'd been caught doing so by the people they were here to help, and he'd been willing to do all that even though they were strangers he had never met before or ever expected to meet again, much less on this journey together, which was not how things were usually done in his village, at least not how they were normally done with strangers who came asking for help from his village.
""Well, I can't keep everyone out of my city forever,"" said Karigan, ""and if we don't go now while there are still some people around, we'll have no choice but to go back tomorrow or even later this afternoon."" She turned to Jirril once more before she entered town but found him staring at himself in a patch of sunlight streaming through an opening in a building's doorway or window frame. A few flecks of dust floated in front of his face as if suspended in midair by magic, but then they quickly disappeared as if they had never been there at all. He stared at himself for several seconds more before looking up at Karigan questioningly—or maybe suspiciously—then ducking back into shadows as if he didn't want anyone else seeing him like that, or even thinking about him for that matter while he was looking at himself in that way. Karigan shrugged off her embarrassment and entered town herself, leaving Jirril alone on the street corner where she'd left him standing guard over their bodies as she thought about what had just happened between him and himself—because she knew what it was like for people to do that sort of thing—and how strange he was acting now with everyone staring at them while they entered town so that they could find what they sought—not because they needed assistance—but because they had come looking for assistance—but then she thought that perhaps they actually did need assistance after all after all those people had seen them fight and had seen what she had done with that knife.",1224,-0.31506396200005654,-0.48072205495324855,-0.81762923802064,-1.1276389134073983,0.4715842544788873
280,R_1mKkggUwvCMljMB,LOW_HR_1,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He knew she wasn't someone from around there—he recognized her from somewhere, but couldn't put his finger on it. Her eyes were so bright, almost golden in color, that they had captured his attention right off. When he spoke to her, she answered in an accent that sounded more British than Irish or Scottish, and though his accent was very much Irish, he couldn't quite place what sort of place she might be from. She seemed familiar, too, but he just couldn't figure out where they'd met before.
She asked for food and drink and then went about drinking as well. She was beautiful—and she could see that he thought so too; she even smiled a little when he stared at her. The way she carried herself reminded him somewhat of the women who danced in his uncle's tavern back home, only this woman didn't have a dancer's body but had breasts and hips that would've made most any man drool. His eyes kept going to those breasts, which were clearly on full display beneath the short dress she wore. It also appeared she had no panties under it, which caused him to swallow hard and look away. She noticed that and smirked.
""You want me,"" she said with a smile. ""And I know you want me, too.""
He nodded, unable to speak through the lump in his throat.
Then she leaned over the table toward him and looked at him intently as if memorizing every detail of his face. Then she touched the corner of her mouth and licked it suggestively. He swallowed again, this time not because of the lump in his throat, but because of the lump in his pants.
""I think I'd like to take a walk with you sometime soon,"" she said softly. ""Would you like that?""
""Yes,"" he stammered, nodding rapidly.
She giggled slightly. ""Well, then. Come with me. We can leave our things here. If anyone asks, I'll say we left together, and then I'll say that I saw your face in my mind all day yesterday and I wanted to see it up close. And maybe we could share a kiss later, after our walk? I'd love to taste your lips.""
As she said this, she looked straight into his eyes, causing his heart rate to accelerate. He knew without a doubt that he wouldn't be able to resist such an offer if given the chance. She stood up and he did as well. They walked down the street together, talking about nothing really—just sharing information about themselves and getting to know each other better. As they got closer to her house, he began to get excited, thinking that they would be able to kiss. But instead she took him into her bedroom.
They made love on her bed and he came inside her several times before she fell asleep, leaving him alone. He was disappointed, but at least he now knew she was real—and he felt something stirring deep within his chest.
A few days later, he ran into her again at the tavern where he worked, and this time she sat at the opposite side of the room from him. She ordered another ale and some bread and cheese before asking for his help with a problem. The woman had just moved to Ireland and had been robbed by two men who'd attacked her and stolen the money she had with her at the time. One of them had threatened to kill her unless she gave him what money she had in her purse, and she hadn't known how to deal with that kind of threat, since she knew nothing of these people. She didn't even know their names.
So she'd asked him, ""Do you have any idea how to protect yourself from men like that, who are violent?""
He told her he probably didn't, but offered to teach her some things anyway. And over the next week, he showed her several moves, including a hold called ""the sleeper."" By the end of the week, she was able to do the move herself.
She thanked him for his help and asked if he might come to her house the following day so she could show him something else that might help him with his fighting skills.
He agreed, and they arranged to meet there later that day. When he arrived, she greeted him warmly. They spent a few moments chatting and drinking and then she showed him how to disarm a man and then used her knowledge of his size to determine which of the many weapons they had at hand that would fit him best. Finally, she showed him how to use those weapons against another person. He practiced those moves until he felt confident enough to try them on her, and when he did, she laughed at him.
""Why don't you practice on me?"" she suggested, holding her hands out to him. ""Let's see if you can beat me.""
He grinned at her challenge and went to her. They fought each other in various ways and then she finally admitted defeat. She hugged him and kissed him lightly on the cheek.
""I'm sorry,"" he said, still smiling. ""But I will get stronger if we keep practicing.""
She kissed him again and then pulled away, looking thoughtful. ""We should go for a walk tomorrow,"" she said quietly, ""so I can give you the details of what I was telling you. We can talk about why I need to know these things.""
""Okay,"" he agreed and then watched her leave the tavern and continue walking down the street.
Two weeks later, he met her at a different tavern and they talked some more as they drank ale. She had been waiting for him and was surprised to find that he'd beaten her to the location. She grinned at him and took a seat on a stool at one of the tables near him.
""That was fast,"" she said. ""Is something wrong?""
""No, I'm just happy to be here,"" he told her.
""I'm glad to hear it,"" she replied. ""What did you want to talk about today?""
He smiled at her question. ""Well, there is something that I'd like to learn more about.""
She looked interested. ""Really? What is it?""
""How to get rid of a man once he has you tied up and gagged,"" he explained. ""And what I'd like to know is how he managed to tie me up in the first place.""
She nodded, looking intrigued now. ""Ahh…I see. You mean the way that the men who attacked me did it.""
""Yes, that's exactly what I mean,"" he confirmed.
""Well, then,"" she said with a sly grin. ""Let's start with the way they held me while tying me up with rope.""
He looked puzzled at her words. ""What do you mean?""
""If you'd ever been tied up and gagged like that, then you'd understand,"" she told him, grinning at his obvious confusion.",1200,-1.2357309296703904,-0.3919378351040576,0.7449397657548904,-0.16614194844101796,-0.32678585567300716
281,R_1eLc7XSAoC8EBde,BAS_HSF_4,Hard Sci-Fi,Basic Coherence,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The president had been very busy since our arrival. He'd held press conferences every other day to talk about what was going on in the city, as well as what was being done to get things back up and running again. The Martian government had declared a state of emergency after the attack by the Chinese, which meant that all nonessential personnel were sent home and the military was called in to help clean up the mess. As a result, there weren't many people around. Most of the residents who hadn't evacuated had gone into hiding until things settled down. There wasn't much else they could do anyway.
My first stop was the café where I worked part time. My boss, Mr. Koshikawa, had left instructions for me to go straight there after leaving Dr. Sato's house. When I got inside, he was sitting behind the counter reading through a stack of papers while sipping some coffee. He looked up when I came in, smiled, and then gestured toward one of the tables.
""Sit down, Kenji,"" he said. ""You look like you're in a hurry.""
""Sorry, Mr. Koshikawa,"" I replied. ""I've got something important to take care of today.""
Mr. Koshikawa nodded and returned to his paperwork. I sat down at the table and opened the envelope. Inside was a note written by the president himself.
Dear Kenji,
Thank you for your hard work during the crisis. You are doing a great job in helping us rebuild the city and get everything back to normal. I want to thank you personally for your efforts. If you would please come see me this afternoon, I will be more than happy to reward you for them.
Yours truly,
President John F. Kennedy
I folded the note up and put it away before standing up to leave. Mr. Koshikawa gave me a smile and said, ""Have fun!""
It didn't take me long to walk to the president's office. Once I arrived, I went inside and handed over my ID card to the guard at the entrance. Then I walked past him and entered the main room. A man wearing a dark suit stood next to the president's desk. He was holding a tablet computer in front of him, but turned to face me when I approached.
""Kenji?"" asked the man. His name tag read ""John Smith"".
""Yes, sir,"" I said.
Smith glanced at the president and then motioned toward me. ""Please wait here for a moment. We'll let you know if the president is ready to see you.""
I nodded and waited for him to return. After a few minutes, he reappeared and told me to follow him. He led me into another room and pointed at a chair. I sat down and watched as he spoke with someone on the other side of the glass window. They were speaking English, so I couldn't understand most of what they were saying. Finally, the man nodded and left.
A minute later, President Kennedy came in. He was wearing a blue suit and tie, along with a white shirt. He looked just like any other American politician you might see on television.
""Hello, Kenji,"" he said. ""How are you?""
""Fine, sir,"" I replied. ""And yourself?""
Kennedy shook his head. ""Not good. Not good at all.""
We both fell silent for a moment. I didn't know how to respond to that, so I decided to change the subject.
""What can I do for you, sir?"" I asked.
""Well, I wanted to ask you to join my cabinet,"" said Kennedy. ""I need someone to lead the reconstruction effort.""
I blinked several times. ""Sir, I'm not sure that's possible,"" I replied. ""I don't think I have the experience or qualifications for that sort of position.""
""Don't worry about that, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""This isn't a political appointment. You won't be answering to anyone but myself. This is strictly volunteer work. All I want you to do is help me rebuild the city. That's it. Nothing more. Is that okay with you?""
I hesitated for a moment. I liked working for Mr. Koshikawa, and I didn't really want to give that up. But at the same time, I knew I had to accept the offer if I wanted to keep living here.
""Yes, sir,"" I finally replied. ""If you think I can help, then I guess I should do it.""
""Good,"" said Kennedy. ""Now, I'll tell you what I've been thinking about. First, I want to make sure everyone knows we're safe again. So, I've ordered the military to start patrolling the streets. They'll be keeping watch over the city 24/7. Second, we're going to have to rebuild the power grid. I'm sending a team of engineers to figure out how to do that. Third, I want to build new housing for the homeless. And lastly, I want to find ways to bring in money. I'm going to have to call a special session of congress to discuss the situation. Hopefully, they'll pass legislation to allow us to sell off some of the land. Once that happens, I plan to use the money to rebuild the city.""
""Sounds like a lot to deal with, sir,"" I said.
""That's why I'm asking for your help, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""I want you to be my point man for all of these projects. You can handle it, right?""
I thought about it for a second. I did feel confident in my ability to manage the reconstruction project, but I wasn't sure I was cut out for the rest of what he was talking about.
""I guess I can try,"" I said. ""But I still don't think I have enough experience for this kind of thing.""
""Don't worry about that,"" said Kennedy. ""I don't expect you to know everything. Just do the best you can. That's all I ask. Okay?""
I nodded. ""Okay, sir.""
""Great,"" said Kennedy. ""Then let's get started. Let's go talk to Mr. Koshikawa.""
He led me back into the main room, where I saw Mr. Koshikawa standing next to the door. The president introduced me to him, and then the three of us headed outside.
""So, Kenji,"" said Kennedy. ""What do you think? Can you handle the reconstruction project?""
""I don't know yet, sir,"" I replied. ""I haven't had a chance to study the details yet.""",1119,0.9666511205312166,-1.4048847938818103,-2.0174138892181364,-0.9436725267651156,-0.05649390295131845
282,R_w6jOsJXwiAEqcHD,FAN_HOR_5,Horror,Fandango,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had eyes that looked like they were made of liquid, with a long tongue coming out the side and a mouth full of teeth. It spoke in a hissing, gurgling voice that sounded like snakes in a box, ""You know you want this."" The face continued staring at me as the lips moved, ""All you have to do is give in...""
I couldn't move, couldn't scream. This thing had paralyzed me. I tried everything to stop whatever it was doing, but nothing worked. I wanted it to go away, but instead, it became more aggressive, its voice rising in pitch.
""Oh yes...Give in...""
It reached out for me and pulled my hair, which it did by the roots. Then it bit down on my throat and tore the skin off me. Blood poured from the wound, coating me like I was a child again at the dentist's office.
I woke up screaming, covered in sweat, shaking. For a moment, I felt like I was going crazy. It must be the heat getting to me. I went to get some water to drink and cool off. After that, I lay back down in the bed, hoping I would go back to sleep.
But before I knew it, I heard the same voice in my head. ""You know you want this.""
I sat straight up in bed, sweating and terrified. There was no mistaking it. I heard it clearly now. As soon as I thought about it, the voice was right there. I felt my heart pounding inside my chest. It was like it was talking directly to me.
""Don't be afraid,"" the voice said. My body shivered. I reached for the knife on my night stand but was too afraid to touch it. I didn't know what could happen if I did.
The voice spoke again, ""Just imagine how good it will feel when you're buried under all of this."" It started laughing. I saw the reflection in my room begin to change into a nightmare landscape. There was a forest in the mirror, the trees and brush bending towards me. I could feel the leaves of the bushes tearing my clothes off.
Then the voice changed. It said, ""I'm going to rip your throat out slowly.""
I stood up and stumbled out into the hallway. My mind was racing. Why had it done that? Was this a hallucination brought on by the heat?
I was still trying to figure it out when I heard the knocking sound again. I turned and ran back into my room. I grabbed the phone and hit speed dial.
A voice answered, ""Hello?""
My mind was still foggy. I was trying to focus on what I wanted to say but couldn't remember any word that seemed to fit. I was about to hang up when it came to me. I just had to keep saying the same thing over and over.
""I can't remember what I'm supposed to say!"" I screamed, then hung up.
As soon as I did so, I heard something behind me. It wasn't the knock at the door. It was closer. It sounded like someone was crawling through the mirror. I turned around and looked into my mirror, which was now shattered into thousands of pieces. There was a man, a dark haired, handsome man in a black suit with a red tie, reaching out to me. He said, ""Don't be afraid, little girl.""
The mirror exploded behind him, and there were other reflections. There were dozens of them. All of them men, all reaching out to me, calling my name.
The voices came again. ""Come out, come out, wherever you are. We have what you want, and we're gonna take you where you've never been, where nothing is safe!""
I ran into my bathroom, locked myself in, then began throwing objects at the mirror. Glass flew everywhere, crashing against the wall and floor. I picked up the bottle of vodka and smashed it against the mirror. It broke apart and fell into a thousand pieces across the floor.
""No,"" I whispered. ""Please, no.""
I began to cry uncontrollably. I felt sick and scared. I was so thirsty and hot. I needed water. I needed something to drink. But I was afraid to leave the bathroom, afraid that whatever had been in my mirror would show up in real life.
It was a long time before I finally calmed down enough to look at myself in the mirror. I looked horrible. My face was covered in blood, and I was trembling. My clothes were torn, and my hair was hanging in disheveled strands.
I couldn't believe what I saw. That wasn't me.
I ran to the mirror and slammed it shut. The glass broke, and it fell to the ground, shattering more. I stood in front of it and stared at myself. I was still terrified, and I didn't know what to do.
When the knocking came again, I turned around. This time, it wasn't in my head. It was real.
""We have to get together. It's the only way to survive,"" the voice said. ""Come out! Come out!""
I couldn't move. I couldn't make myself run. I was terrified. The voices were louder. It was coming closer. I looked up to see an image of me standing in front of me. It was blurry and hard to understand. The voice said, ""If you don't, we'll break your door down and take you.""
Something pushed me from behind, then I heard the shattering of glass. The mirror fell on top of me and cut into my arm. I screamed, but the voices were still coming at me. Someone took hold of my arms, and I screamed again, thinking it was them. But they held me down.
There was more breaking glass. And another voice. This one was stronger and clearer.
""I told you to come out!""
He was right next to me, the man in the suit with the red tie. He was holding my wrists, but they were tied tightly together. I was terrified. I kept trying to turn around, to see who was attacking me. But whoever it was held me down easily. I looked up at the man's face.
""I told you to come out!"" he repeated. It was the same voice I'd heard before in my mirror.
I struggled and yelled, ""What do you want?""
He released my hands and grabbed my face again. There was something inside it moving, like it had a mind of its own.
""I have a gift for you. You don't understand, and it won't make sense to you right now, but I promise you, everything will be better once you join us. Trust me.""",1173,1.0997561987216504,0.8903547625309521,1.1641445248827649,0.5912249502902642,0.7928865833209066
283,R_2a8iYtF7ulc4uJj,ACE_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,Ace of Spade,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I made my way across town to the presidential palace where I would be meeting with the president himself. As I approached, I saw a small crowd forming outside of the gates, but no one was actually waiting there. Curious, I walked up and asked what they were all standing around for. One man told me that he had heard the president had arrived yesterday.
""You mean the president is here?"" I asked, surprised by the news. He nodded.
""Yes. We've been expecting you,"" he replied.
I shook his hand then turned towards the front doors when another person stepped forward and told me not to go any further. I looked back at him confused as he handed me a badge with a number printed on it. ""This will get you through security. You'll need it to enter the inner circle,"" he said, pointing to the line of people who had gathered behind me. I put my hands inside my pockets, trying to figure out why they'd give me a badge if they didn't want me to go in. When I thought about it, it made sense. The only reason anyone would ever be given a badge like that was because they were expected to show up somewhere. And since they were giving them away now, obviously someone had come to see me today.
That was enough for me. I put the badge on and went into the palace, walking past several armed guards who eyed me warily as I passed. Inside, I was greeted by two other men wearing similar badges, which meant I could proceed deeper into the compound. Once inside, I followed the signs until I came to a set of double doors that led to the president's office. I walked in, passing several more security checkpoints along the way, finally arriving at the president's office.
The room was large and well decorated, filled with paintings of historical figures, sculptures of important scientists, and various artifacts of ancient civilizations. It wasn't quite as impressive as some of the rooms in the White House or even Buckingham Palace, but it still held its own. A man in a black suit stood next to the door, looking at me expectantly as I approached. ""Good morning, Mr. Smith,"" he said as I entered the room. His voice sounded familiar, though I couldn't place it. ""I'm President Theodore Roosevelt.""
""Hello, Mr. President,"" I said, shaking his hand. ""My name is Peter Smith, and I believe you know my father.""
The president smiled warmly. ""Of course I do. I understand your family has been very supportive of our efforts here on Mars.""
""Yes sir, we certainly have. That's why I'm here today,"" I explained.
President Roosevelt nodded, motioning to the seat across from his desk. ""Please, take a seat. There's something I wanted to discuss with you.""
""What did you wish to speak with me about, Mr. President? Was it something related to the work I'm doing on Mars?"" I asked.
""Not exactly, though I think you might find it interesting. First, let me apologize for making you wait so long for my arrival,"" he began, sitting down in his chair. ""It's just that we've received a lot of attention recently, both positive and negative, and I felt it best to avoid unnecessary distractions while we're dealing with everything else going on here.""
I sat down too and nodded. ""No problem, Mr. President. I can appreciate how busy you must be right now. Is there anything I can help you with?""
The president smiled again. ""Actually, yes. I was hoping you might be able to assist us with a new initiative.""
""New initiative?"" I repeated.
""Yes. I've spoken with many of my advisors about this idea, and they all agree it would be beneficial to humanity, particularly if implemented early enough,"" he explained.
""Early enough?"" I questioned. ""For what purpose?""
""We're working hard to prepare for a future where humans may have to leave Earth entirely,"" he answered.
""Leave Earth…you mean go to another planet?"" I asked incredulously.
""Precisely,"" he confirmed. ""Right now, we don't have any plans to abandon our home world, but we're always prepared for such an eventuality. In fact, I think it would be wise to begin preparing for such a move immediately rather than waiting until we absolutely have to make the decision to evacuate. If we start moving things off-planet now, it should make things easier when it comes time to relocate.""
""Moving things off-planet…that sounds expensive,"" I remarked.
""Well, it would be. But we are talking about a much larger undertaking than simply relocating a few hundred thousand people,"" he noted.
""How big?"" I asked, curious.
""Let's just say there's no shortage of people willing to invest in the endeavor. We'd also need to build a ship capable of carrying millions of people, and there are plenty of companies and private investors who are interested in participating,"" he said.
""A ship…carrying millions?"" I asked. ""I thought the first mission to Mars only carried a couple of dozen astronauts.""
""Those were test missions. We needed to make sure the technology worked before sending humans there permanently. Our current plan calls for launching a fleet of ships, each carrying thousands of passengers and cargo,"" he explained. ""Once the ships arrive on Mars, they'll unload their supplies and equipment then send the remaining passengers to the surface. They'll be joined by additional ships as the population grows over time.""
I shook my head, thinking it all seemed incredibly risky. ""If the colony fails, everyone dies,"" I pointed out.
""Yes, I suppose you're right,"" the president agreed. ""But we believe the risks are worth taking. Not only would it give us a second chance at life, but it could also pave the way for the expansion of human civilization beyond our solar system. After all, once we've established ourselves on Mars, there's nothing stopping us from exploring the rest of the galaxy. We'll be free to travel anywhere in the universe.""
I shook my head. ""That's a lot to ask of anyone. Even if the risk is worthwhile, it seems like it would take a significant amount of money to pull it off.""
""We already have a good chunk of the funding,"" the president replied. ""In addition to the investments I mentioned earlier, several major corporations and private investors have pledged to contribute. I just need you to get the word out and encourage others to join the cause.""
""I'll do what I can,"" I assured him. ""Though I imagine the president of the United States isn't the best person to be asking for donations.""
The president chuckled. ""You're probably correct,"" he admitted. ""But I've got a feeling you'll come up with a solution to that problem soon enough.",1192,0.5561333202764439,-0.09174700723533398,-0.9423502253799944,1.4802251223532863,0.9585610262035513
284,R_1o6jgCjxJNVCyL3,ALL_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I had spent most of yesterday helping my friend and former colleague, Professor Matsuoka, get settled in with his new team of researchers, but now I was back home to grab lunch before heading back to the lab.
The day was still warm and dry, as it often is here in summer on the planet. I took a seat at one of the tables outside of a small food stall near the university's main entrance, where students were buying their lunches and chatting about their plans for the long weekend. As I waited for my order, I noticed Dr. Sato watching me from across the street with a curious expression on her face. I waved and smiled at her as she approached, but she seemed hesitant to talk to me.
""Are you busy right now?"" she asked when she reached me. ""I know we're not supposed to talk during our breaks, but I thought maybe there was something else I could do for you.""
I looked at her carefully, noticing that her hands were shaking slightly. I'd been working with Dr. Sato for over five years now, and I knew that she was always very careful with what she said around other people, especially those she didn't trust completely. She had been with the university for almost thirty years, and she wasn't just a colleague—she was also a close friend of mine. I was worried about her, so I decided to tell her the truth.
""Actually, Dr. Sato, I've got some good news,"" I told her, handing her the envelope. ""There's a job opening in my department. I think you should apply.""
She looked at the envelope in surprise and then stared at me suspiciously. ""Why are you telling me this?"" she asked. ""You don't have any reason to be nice to me right now, do you? I'm sure your boss doesn't like it if you spend time talking to me.""
""It's no big deal,"" I reassured her. ""I've just found out that the university needs someone to work in our lab on Earth. It's an assistant position, but it would be a great opportunity for you. And I thought maybe you might want to go home to Japan for a while. You've been here a long time, and I know that you miss your family and friends. I just thought...""
Dr. Sato shook her head angrily. ""I don't want to leave Mars,"" she said. ""And I'm not going to move to Earth. Not after what happened to me there. No way!""
""But the president wants us all to return to Earth for the next round of research,"" I argued. ""We have to find out why the Martians attacked our colony last year. He's planning to send the entire faculty back to Earth, so it makes sense that he'd want one of his top scientists to lead the team.""
Dr. Sato glared at me as I spoke. ""Don't talk to me about the president,"" she snapped. ""I think you should be ashamed of yourself for trying to get me to betray the trust I placed in you.""
She turned away from me and started walking quickly down the sidewalk, leaving me behind with my lunch. As she disappeared around the corner, I looked down at the envelope in my hand and frowned. The president had told me that Dr. Sato was one of the most promising young scientists on Mars, and he wanted to keep her working with him. I was sure that the job would be a great opportunity for her, but she didn't want to take it. That's when I realized why.
She had been here on Mars for almost thirty years, and she wanted to stay because she believed in the project. She loved Mars and everything it stood for—the people she worked with, the research she did, the work she was doing to make Mars a better place for future generations. And now she was going home? It wasn't fair to her, or to anyone else who cared about this place. If we were going to leave Mars, then we should do it together, not as a group of people who had nothing in common with each other.
As I sat there watching Dr. Sato disappear into the distance, I knew that I couldn't just sit back and watch her go. I had to tell her how I felt, and I had to do it right away. But where could I meet with her without raising any suspicions? I had only been home for an hour after helping Professor Matsuoka move in, and I didn't know where she would have gone already.
That's when I remembered a small café near the university where we often went to grab coffee together. The place was owned by a friend of mine named Akio, who also happened to be the best barista in all of Japan. I knew he would understand what I was going through, and I could trust him to keep our conversation private.
I walked up to the café and found Akio sitting at his usual table, sipping his coffee and reading the newspaper. He looked up as I approached and smiled warmly.
""You're late,"" he teased. ""I've been waiting here for over thirty minutes.""
I laughed and shook my head as I sat down across from him. ""Sorry,"" I said. ""I got caught up helping my colleague move into his new lab. Do you mind if I wait for a little while? I promise I won't take too long.""
Akio nodded, and we spent the next half hour talking about our favorite foods, TV shows, and movies. Finally, he sighed and pushed away from the table.
""I've got to get back to work,"" he explained. ""But I wanted to talk to you before you left today.""
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small box wrapped in shiny paper. I took it from him and opened it carefully. Inside was a silver ring, made from the same metal used on the rings that the colonists wear to mark their status. It was a symbol of the colony—the first of its kind ever created outside of Earth. And there was only one person in the colony who would ever give me a ring like this.
""Thank you, Akio,"" I whispered. ""I love you.""
Akio smiled and put his arm around my shoulder. ""I'm happy to hear that, Ken,"" he said. ""And I'm even happier to see you wearing it.""
He leaned closer and kissed me gently on the lips, and I closed my eyes as I felt his arms wrap around my waist and pull me close against him. He pulled away after just a few seconds, and we both stared at each other for a moment, smiling. Then he turned away from me and headed toward the door, leaving me alone with the ring.",1213,0.7559425493838764,0.9437482300750396,0.5860331447212476,0.12254334456405218,0.11781360585293668
285,R_2f24HBOlAU3d8QT,MOR_HR_10,Historical Romance,Morpho,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd watched her, his gaze drawn to her like a fish to light. Her hair was a mass of curls, her eyes the deepest blue he'd ever seen and her lips red and full.
She'd been looking at him, too, and it wasn't until he caught her watching him that he realized she was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.
She'd taken off her hat and her hair fell in waves down her back. She wore a long, brown dress, the fabric so fine it was almost see-through. Her dress wasn't even dirty. It was as if she'd been born in it.
A man at the table across from her had leaned over and said something to her. She hadn't looked at him, she'd just smiled at him, and the warmth of it had spread from his chest to his groin.
He'd been so embarrassed by that reaction that he'd left the tavern without taking a drink. He hurried down the street to an alley, his heart pounding so hard he could barely breathe.
He hadn't been able to go back to work for three days after that. He'd spent that time at home, watching the window, waiting for her to reappear. When she finally did, he was determined not to let her out of his sight again.
She was still beautiful to him after all these years. He wasn't sure if that made him a complete fool or a complete fool, but he'd never once stopped thinking about her.
He didn't know how old she was. He didn't know where in Ireland she was from or what name she had. He didn't know anything about her at all, except that she made him feel things that were too intense for him.
He didn't know how long he would stay away from his family and friends before he couldn't stand it anymore and went back to face them again. At least this way, he had someone waiting for him when he came home.
He thought of her often now when he missed her. It was always when he needed a reminder of what it felt like to be young and carefree again.
He tried to tell himself that this was just a temporary thing that would end when she went back to her own life, but the truth was, he'd never met anyone like her before or since.
He knew he was going to see her again when he saw the house she'd rented for herself on his way into town. He remembered the way it looked from the window of the tavern and smiled at the memory of how different it looked from this perspective.
The house wasn't large by any means, but it was obviously taken care of well. It had two stories and an attic, and there were small gardens off to either side of it that were full of flowers he hadn't seen before in Ireland.
He pulled up in front of the house and got out of the car, closing the door behind him with a sigh of satisfaction. He was home.
""It's good to see you,"" she said as she stepped out of the house and looked up at him with open arms.
He wrapped his arms around her and held on for a moment before stepping back so he could look down into her face again. ""It's good to see you.""
""Are you going to tell me what you've been doing all these years?"" she asked as she stepped closer and looked up at him questioningly.
""It's a long story,"" he said as he slid his hand around to the small of her back. ""I think we should go inside for that.""
""I thought you said you were going to tell me."" She frowned as she looked up at him again, clearly annoyed with him now that she knew what he wanted from her.
He put his hand on her shoulder and laughed gently as he looked down at her again. ""I will tell you everything,"" he promised her as he placed his other hand over hers on his shoulder in an attempt to stop her from pulling away from him again. ""But I'm hungry and I want something to eat first.""
""I'm sure I have some food in there,"" she said as she looked up at him again and smiled sweetly at him.
""You have some food in there?"" He frowned as he thought about all the days he'd spent watching her through the window in the tavern before finally stopping by one day to see if she was there. ""Are you sure?""
""Yes,"" she said as she nodded enthusiastically at him before stepping back and reaching up to touch the buttons on his shirt with long fingers. ""Why don't you come inside with me and I'll show you.""
""Why don't I come inside with you?"" He grinned at her as he looked down into those dark blue eyes again. ""I think I might like that.""
She laughed softly as she nodded vigorously at him, clearly pleased that he wanted to come inside with her after all this time. ""I'll go get some food ready while you get your things from the car.""
""I'm not going,"" he said as he pulled her hand down from the buttons on his shirt and held it in his own palm instead. ""I'm staying here with you.""
She smiled up at him as if she thought that was wonderful news and leaned forward to kiss his cheek before walking inside ahead of him. He followed behind her, watching as she moved gracefully around the small house, carrying things from the kitchen out into the small yard in front of it where there was a table and chairs set up for eating outside on nice days like today.
It was an idyllic scene with the bright sun shining down on them through the trees outside while they ate their lunch together on the table off to one side of the house instead. She'd made some sandwiches for them after they'd finished eating the bread and cheese slices they'd gotten from town earlier in the day. He'd had no idea how long it had been since their last home-cooked meal until then.
They ate in silence for a few moments before she cleared their plates away and went back inside again with them while he waited for her to come back outside again so they could walk back into town together again instead of having to drive separately now that they were home instead of being away on business or somewhere else like they used to do when they were younger.
""Have you always lived here?"" He asked when she came out of the house again with their empty plates in hand this time instead of leaving them out in the yard for someone else to find later.
""No,"" she said as she sat down next to him on one side of the table instead of across from him this time like they had been doing every time they ate together before they left Ireland all those years ago together today instead. ""I lived here for a while after I got married but then I moved back here after I divorced my first husband."" She paused for a few moments before shrugging slightly as she looked up at him with a smile on her face once more. ""I've never lived here before.""",1281,1.1698159791490188,1.097455161627337,-0.44657539608920455,-0.1348317585161544,0.5217552907167573
286,R_1EY7sNRLKXir5nt,GEN_HF_3,High Fantasy,Genesis,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They were both drawn to this place as if pulled there by an unseen force.
""This is the place,"" said Ancaladar. ""I can sense it.""
""It looks deserted,"" said Caledor. ""Should we go around?""
""No! This is where I am meant to be!"" cried Cilarnen. He ran down the slope toward the village.
Ancaladar flew ahead of him, his talons clicking against stone as he landed on the battlements of one of the towers that flanked the entrance to the village. He hopped onto the next tower and was gone so quickly that his shadow vanished almost before it had formed on the wall. Cilarnen took off after him, flying low over the rooftops until he reached the ground.
He was met by a pair of guards who stood outside the gates to the village. They watched him approach warily, but not with any real alarm. When he got close enough for them to see him clearly they relaxed visibly. One of them stepped forward and bowed slightly.
""Welcome to our humble home,"" she said. ""My name is Elsra, and I am the matriarch of this village. Who are you? What brings you here?""
Cilarnen's heart beat faster. He could feel the power emanating from the walls of the village; it made him shiver with excitement, even though he knew in his mind that it wasn't magic. He had felt this kind of power before, many times. It was the power of the natural world, the power of the earth, and the animals that lived upon it. The power of the wind, and the rain, and the sun, and the stars in the sky. And he was part of it now! He didn't know how or why, but he knew that he belonged here.
""I'm Cilarnen,"" he said, ""and I've come home!""
Elsra smiled warmly. She was a pretty woman, dark-haired and strong-featured, her face framed by long, wavy hair tied back behind her head. Her eyes were grey and bright, and she carried herself with the air of authority that came from having been born to command.
""Come inside with me, child,"" she said. ""You must be hungry after your journey. We'll get you something hot to eat.""
She turned and beckoned to the second guard, a tall man whose beard was braided, then led him through the gate. He followed obediently, his hands clasped behind his back as he walked beside her.
Cilarnen followed them, his eyes fixed on the ground in front of him as he tried to think of what to say.
They entered the village through a narrow alleyway between two houses, which opened out into a courtyard. In the center of the courtyard stood an old well, surrounded by a low wall. The roof of a house was built over it, providing shelter from the elements and making a pleasant spot for people to gather. There was a fire burning in a pit set before the well, casting its warmth over the gathering. Cilarnen recognized it as being a common feature of human habitations—the fire was used for cooking, and also served to keep away predators that might otherwise attack a group of people gathered together in one place.
A large cook pot was suspended above the flames. The smell of freshly baked bread filled the air, and Cilarnen's stomach growled loudly. Elsra saw him eyeing the food and laughed.
""Do not worry about the food, my young friend. My husband and I will feed you. Come sit with us.""
She picked up a wooden spoon and began stirring the contents of the pot, adding more water from a clay jug sitting nearby. A few moments later she poured the mixture into a heavy iron skillet and placed it on the hearth.
""We make our own bread here,"" she said. ""It's very good, and it doesn't cost much. But we don't have much to trade. You won't find many men who would come here willingly. The only reason we haven't become extinct is that we live in peace with our neighbors and never steal from anyone.""
Cilarnen looked up at her, surprised. ""But you're not alone!"" he exclaimed. ""You have other people living here, don't you? Other than yourself, that is.""
Elsra smiled again. ""Yes, there are others. Most of them are older than I, and they spend most of their time in the fields, tending the crops, or the animals, or the forest. There are a couple of women my age, too, and a few younger men. That's how we survive. We help each other, and the children learn to work early. It means we have no time to be idle.""
She lifted the skillet out of the fire and set it on a table, then sliced a large chunk of bread from the loaf that rested on top of it. She gave it to Cilarnen. He took it gratefully, and bit into it hungrily. It was soft and fresh and warm, and tasted wonderful. Cilarnen felt suddenly ashamed of his earlier rudeness toward Elsra.
""Thank you,"" he said.
She laughed softly. ""We do what we can,"" she said. ""That's all any of us can ever do.""
Cilarnen nodded, and finished the last piece of bread. He felt full, but his stomach still rumbled.
Elsra handed him another slice of bread, then brought him a cup of water. ""Drink this, and let me know if you need anything else. I'll tell my husband that you're here.""
Cilarnen thanked her and sat down on a bench near the fire, watching the villagers as they worked. He couldn't remember the last time he'd seen so many people working together in such harmony. The townspeople seemed content, and happy even, though there was a sadness in their faces that told of hardships long past and sorrows yet to come. But they were friendly, and curious, and willing to talk to him.
Elsra returned to him a short while later, carrying a tray laden with several bowls of stew. She put it down in front of him and smiled.
""I hope this is to your liking,"" she said. ""It's a little plain, but it should be filling enough for now. If you wish, I'll have my maid prepare some porridge for you later; it's better for digesting meat.""
Cilarnen stared at her. His mouth watered as he thought of the delicious-looking stew on his plate, but he shook his head firmly. ""I'm fine just as I am,"" he said.
Elsra smiled again, then left him to finish eating in peace. He found himself relaxing; the peaceful atmosphere of the village reminded him of home, and the people here reminded him of his father.",1190,-0.2245315658459596,1.2942322752726771,0.1452610958849464,-0.6560710229084278,0.5527369362622798

A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. As soon as the city had come into view, the others on the road cheered. They'd seen nothing like it since crossing the river, and to see one so far away from the mountains made them think that there would be no danger of being caught by orcs.
""I'll leave my bow at the inn,"" Breena said, ""so I can ride with you.""
""We're not going to make any progress if we have to watch our back every moment,"" Marcus replied, ""especially not with how tired everyone is. I'll stay here, just in case something unexpected happens.""
He pulled his cloak tightly around him before turning toward the woods on the other side of the road and disappearing into the trees.
""Well then,"" the rest of the group said. They dismounted and began walking toward the settlement.
""Shouldn't we warn them?"" Breena asked. ""There could be a horde of orcs waiting for us, after all.""
""We're only five,"" Fennel said, ""and I know for a fact that the last time an orc horde came this far south they were stopped by the dragon king. Not to mention we are supposed to be the defenders of this land, and those who live here aren't going to take kindly to anyone trying to take over their home.""
""It's better if we don't draw any unwanted attention to ourselves,"" Vlora said. ""If they are still around, and if they even noticed what happened to them, then we will find out when it's too late.""
They reached the shore of the lake without incident. It was the same flat water that filled the rest of the valley, but there wasn't anything around it for miles. The buildings that dotted the area looked abandoned, and there were no signs of life.
""It doesn't look like anyone lives here,"" Breena said.
""Doesn't mean they aren't around somewhere,"" Vlora said. She raised her voice a few octaves and said, ""Hello, anyone home? Anyone?""
The forest was silent.
""Maybe you're just not friendly enough,"" Vlora said. She took the lead as she led them toward the village, and pointed to a house with smoke rising up from its chimney. ""That one.""
It was smaller than the others, but also in better shape. There were no holes or cracks in the walls. Its windows were clean. It had been well cared for over the years.
""Someone lives here,"" Fennel said. ""Or at least someone is watching out for them.""
Vlora knocked on the door, and waited a minute before it was answered by a young girl who could have only been a few years younger than Fennel. She was thin, with long hair tied into braids. Her arms were covered with embroidery, and her dress was a simple affair made out of white cloth. She looked very much like Vlora remembered seeing women like that back in her days in the city.
""I'm looking for some help,"" Vlora said.
The girl nodded and gestured to follow her. They walked into an open area in the center of the town that had clearly been designed to hold meetings and other large gatherings. The tables and chairs had been pulled away, revealing the floor was paved with flagstones. There were no decorations of any kind, and the only light came from a single torch that hung from the wall on the far end. A set of stairs led down to the ground level.
""What do you need?"" the girl asked.
""A healer,"" Vlora replied. ""I've heard that there's a good one living around here. Can you tell me where I can find them?""
The girl blinked at her. ""You mean…this is a healer's house? It hasn't been used in a long time, and there have only been a couple of people who've stopped by since then. I don't know anything about them, but it shouldn't be too hard to find them if you just head up the road until you reach the next village. It's a small town with a big inn, so the healer's probably there. She might not be as good as the last ones we had, though. This area is in poor shape. People are mostly traveling on foot these days, and it hasn't been long since our last healer left.""
""I don't care how good she is,"" Vlora said, ""I'll take whoever they have if it means saving a life. If you can lead us to her, that would be great. But even better than that would be a healer who hasn't gone insane yet and is willing to help.""
She saw the girl's face pucker when she said that. There was no way they were going to find a sane person in this place, and she had no idea why Vlora thought otherwise.
The girl nodded and led them to the edge of the village. They could still see the two towers at the front of it, but other than that, everything was hidden from view.
""I'm going back now,"" she said, ""but I will try to get you some help.""
They waited for a minute before the door opened again and a young man walked out. He had long hair pulled into two braids, and wore a simple tunic made from blue cloth. His arms were covered with tattoos, but not the same kind of designs that Breena had. These were old-fashioned images that looked like they'd been drawn by a blind person, or perhaps a child.
""Vlora?"" he said in a soft, breathy voice.
""Yes,"" Vlora replied.
""I heard you were back here, but I didn't expect to see you so soon. I'm surprised they haven't sent a detachment of guards after you yet. Were you successful?""
""More than we could have hoped,"" Vlora replied. She gestured to Fennel and Breena. ""These are my friends. I need your help, too.""
The man's eyes went wide, and he turned to look at them.
""What happened to them?"" he asked. ""That isn't your normal dress. Where did you get those?""
""You wouldn't believe me if I told you,"" Vlora said. ""We came down here looking for a healer, and one of the people I know in town saw the rest of us and said that someone was willing to help. They're very sick. Do you think you can heal them?""
He shook his head. ""No…I don't think that's possible, but I might be able to help them if you let me take them back to my house.""
""You can't do anything?"" she asked. ""I thought you were the best healer around here.""
The young man sighed and pulled a pipe from his pocket. He tapped it against his teeth as he stared off into space for a second.",1196,-1.0944987434350366,-0.5071379173143602,-1.0952969551121943,-0.10545553301058079,-0.1823997285513863
288,R_3rMPBCPUCXnknjn,OUR_HSF_4,Hard Sci-Fi,Ouroboros,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
I didn't know what I'd be walking into, but President Vasquez had asked us to come to his office, which was unusual for him. He usually left most of the administrative duties to his cabinet and advisors. It seemed like he wanted to talk to me alone. If he knew about the failed coup attempt by Admiral O'Leary's rogue forces, then I knew I wouldn't be leaving the office alive.
The president had been in office for nearly fifty years now, and it didn't surprise me that he was still around despite how much older he looked. The man was a master politician and never let anything get too personal, especially not with people working directly under him.
I walked toward the presidential palace, passing through one of the three main gates, where military guards stood at attention, saluting me as I went by. A pair of hovercabs sat in front of each gate, a security measure put in place after the terrorist attack ten years ago. The taxi drivers had complained that it limited their income, but it helped protect our president.
When I finally reached the building, I could hear faint music playing inside, which was odd since the president wasn't even scheduled to have any meetings today. I had no doubt they were setting up some kind of elaborate trap for me. It would take more than a few bodyguards and guards to stop me.
""Hey, Jim!"" said a voice behind me, making me jump. I spun around quickly and spotted one of my neighbors. His name was Wilson, a retired pilot for the military who'd lived here on Mars for nearly three decades. ""You're late today.""
He looked like an older version of John Travolta, except without the gold chains or flashy outfits. Wilson wore his hair short and curly, which contrasted his sharp blue eyes.
""I'm sorry,"" I said, walking toward him. ""It's just been a long day.""
Wilson gave me a sympathetic look. He didn't know about what had happened back at O'Leary's base. But he did know that I was on my way to see the president, something I wouldn't tell anyone else.
""Did you hear the good news?"" said Wilson.
""About what?"" I asked, trying to sound interested.
""President Vasquez is throwing a big party this Friday to celebrate the Mars Olympics! And it'll be at the palace!""
I didn't answer. I was sure that the party would be a trap. But I needed to go so that I could get into the building and find out why Vasquez had sent for me.
""Well, I'll see you around,"" said Wilson. ""I've gotta get going before my wife notices I'm gone."" He gave me a quick hug and a friendly slap on the back before jogging away.
I went through the second security checkpoint and was met by another guard who asked if I'd been expecting anyone. I said I hadn't, then waited while the guard ran my ID, which he returned to me after confirming I was authorized to enter. I walked down the corridor toward the president's office, where I could see more guards standing outside in front of a closed door with a sign reading:
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
Private Entrance
My heart skipped a beat when I saw a familiar figure waiting for me near the entrance to the private elevator.
""Admiral O'Leary,"" I said, not hiding how surprised I was to see him.
""Hello, Jim,"" he replied.
I tried to appear as casual as possible. This was all part of Vasquez's plan to capture me, I was certain. I couldn't let my emotions show.
""What are you doing here?"" I asked, walking past the admiral to the elevators.
He blocked my way, putting his hand on my chest. I tensed up, ready to strike, but I kept my cool and stared into his eyes. If he wanted a fight, we'd have one, but if he let me go, there wouldn't be any blood spilled.
""I have a message for you,"" said Admiral O'Leary.
""A message?"" I said.
He gave a brief nod, then handed over a sealed envelope. I thanked him and took it from him before going inside the elevator.
""We're going up to the top floor,"" said O'Leary. ""It'll be easier for us to talk in private.""
The doors closed, and the elevator rose to the top floor. It opened again, and we walked to the president's office. Another guard stood in front of the door, who told O'Leary that he'd better wait outside. We passed him, then entered the office.
""How can I help you, sir?"" said an elderly woman behind the desk. She was about my age and had brown hair, which she wore tied back tightly. ""Is this about the meeting you requested earlier today?""
""Yes,"" said O'Leary, opening the letter. ""I'm sorry to say that it has been cancelled."" He handed it to me.
I read the short message from President Vasquez:
It seems the time for change is upon us. Please come by my office at your earliest convenience.
I nodded to O'Leary as I took the message from him, then stepped toward the door. But he caught my arm and pulled me back.
""Jim, you know I like to keep things personal. You're not the only one working here on Mars. There are many people who depend on me. And if it came down to it, I would stand up against you.""
I smiled at him. ""And I would do the same for you,"" I said, squeezing his hand.
The admiral glared at me. ""Don't get carried away."" He stepped forward and grabbed my arm again, but I easily threw him off.
""No,"" I said, reaching for my gun. ""You've made your point.""
He backed away. ""I hope you know what you're doing,"" he said. ""I'll find a way to stop you. Even if I have to kill you.""
I reached the door and turned around to look at him. ""I would never let you take the fall for this,"" I said. ""But I don't think that's going to happen. Your attempt to take control of Mars failed. They're not going to give you another chance.""
I walked out of the office with O'Leary close behind. We met with another guard just outside the building who led us to the parking lot and escorted us into a black sedan that drove away quickly.
""We need to get him,"" said O'Leary, pulling out his phone. ""There's still time before they move him. I can still do it.""
""Why do you care so much about him?"" I asked. ""You don't even know him.""
O'Leary scowled. ""You don't understand,"" he said. ""Admiral Ressler is my friend. I don't want to see him die.""",1192,0.2603730375870066,0.6462114625599876,0.07069280766472451,-0.24823170493001276,0.4395610322708819
289,R_1pMWlc7fTJWntOv,GEN_HSF_4,Hard Sci-Fi,Genesis,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. My boss had told me he would be waiting for me when I arrived so I headed down the street toward the big white dome where the government offices were located.
The walk was nice; it made me feel like I could breathe again after being cooped up in my tiny apartment all morning. The air was crisp and clean outside, and the sky was clear blue as far as the eye could see. In most places on Earth, people couldn't even see that much because of all the pollution. But not here—Mars was almost completely free from any traces of biological contaminants or toxins.
There were still some areas, though, where there wasn't enough oxygen to support life. Places such as the polar caps, which made up nearly half of the planet's total surface area and covered more than three quarters of its land mass. These cold and inhospitable regions were off limits to humans—no one lived there. Not anymore, anyway.
But then, how long ago did people live there? Only about forty years ago, right? It wasn't long after that that humanity first set foot on Mars and began colonizing the planet. They'd built cities, farms, and factories—establishing a thriving community within just a few short decades. We found water in abundance beneath the soil, and soon the population exploded from hundreds to millions overnight. There were no more wars, and everyone seemed content to live together in peace.
That is, until the incident.
It happened four years ago, and has been referred to as the ""Great Mistake."" No one knew what exactly caused the catastrophe, but the city of New Tokyo was destroyed in an instant by what appeared to be a massive solar flare. Every single person on the planet vanished without a trace. All our technology stopped working, too. Communication was impossible, and we had no way of knowing if anyone was alive anymore. Some scientists believed it was a natural occurrence that had somehow gotten out of control, while others thought it might have been caused by an alien invasion.
In either case, the world was plunged back into the dark ages, and we lost everything.
Then, several months later, we discovered that they were alive. It turned out that the vast majority of us had simply teleported away from Earth when the disaster struck. A fleet of ships left the planet with hundreds of thousands of people aboard them. The ships were programmed to go straight for Mars, and they arrived less than one week after the disappearance. That's when the real trouble started.
We learned that the people who had left behind were not happy about being abandoned, and many of them were willing to do anything in their power to get back home. The situation quickly devolved into chaos as the humans on Mars fought among themselves for food and supplies. Eventually, the United Nations stepped in to quell the violence, and took control of the Martian colony.
It wasn't long before the UN realized that the problem wasn't going to go away. If we were to ever become a truly independent nation, we needed to build a secure border between our new home and Earth. This was the main reason why we didn't allow anyone else to settle on Mars, and why we only allowed refugees to come here in small numbers. It was also the reason why I joined the military instead of continuing my studies at MIT.
As I approached the dome and entered through the front doors, I felt the familiar rush of excitement that I always got when entering the grounds of the government building. The lobby was bustling with activity as workers hurried around, trying to make sure everything was ready for the president's arrival. They all looked frantic, and I guessed it was because the meeting was supposed to take place within the next hour.
After checking in and giving them my ID, I walked down the corridor toward the elevator and found myself in the middle of a group of soldiers who were standing around talking. Most of them wore matching black uniforms and had a similar look about them, but that wasn't the only thing they had in common. I recognized one of the men from my training sessions last week. He was a big guy, standing tall and confident with broad shoulders. As I drew closer, I saw that his eyes were dark and piercing, and that he had a scar running along his jawline.
""Hey, Mike! What are you doing here?"" I asked.
He gave me a big grin. ""Just checking out what the other guys look like. You know, to make sure I'm not the only one wearing camo pants.""
His words made me laugh. ""You're definitely not alone there. Everyone seems to love those things.""
Mike shook his head. ""Yeah, well, looks like we're all gonna have to suffer together. At least it's better than the old fatigues. Still, these will probably change eventually, too. It's hard to say what they'll do next.""
I nodded. ""True. It's funny, I never really thought about it before, but you're right. Technology has changed so much since the first colonists came here. The first computers weren't even invented yet, and now we have smart phones that can access the internet from anywhere on the planet.""
Mike shook his head. ""Smart phone? What's that?""
I laughed and slapped him on the shoulder. ""Whoa, sorry man. I forgot that you grew up in the Stone Age.""
He grinned. ""Don't worry about it. I hear that your generation is going to be pretty different from ours. They've already done some amazing stuff, like inventing the teleportation device.""
I smiled. ""Really? That's awesome!""
""And they're even talking about cloning, and creating artificial intelligence.""
My eyes widened. ""Wow...that sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.""
""Well, it is, but that's not the worst part,"" Mike added.
A chill ran down my spine. I was pretty sure I knew what he was getting at. ""Oh yeah?""
""They're already planning to terraform Earth, too. Apparently, we're going to try to make the planet more like Mars so that we can live there someday.""
The elevator dinged, and we both stepped inside. Once the doors closed, Mike continued. ""Can you believe that?""
I thought for a moment before answering. ""It's true, isn't it?""
""Yeah, I guess so. I mean, it makes sense. Look at it this way, Earth has lots of resources that we don't need, and we have plenty of room here on Mars. Why not try to turn it into a second home for us?""
He had a point. I'd heard the same thing from a few other people, too. I didn't want to sound pessimistic, but it did seem strange that we would try to recreate the conditions on Earth when there was a perfectly good home here on Mars in the first place.
We reached the top floor and exited the elevator, then started walking toward the president's office. As we walked past the reception desk, two women sat there talking quietly.

I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had two eyes and a mouth, but it wasn't human. It didn't even have a head or any arms. Just a torso that ended in what looked like a black mass of tentacles. ""Who are you?"" I said. The thing stared straight at me with its one eye. I could feel something crawling all over my skin. I tried to run away from the mirror, but I couldn't move at all. Then the creature spoke. ""You're dead,"" he said. ""You died yesterday."" He kept staring into my eyes for a few moments before saying anything else. Then I felt something cold touch my neck, and the last thing I knew was waking up next to my bed with my throat cut open.
—from ""The Man From Beyond""
It had been five days since we arrived in the town of Stull, and things were going pretty well. All three of us were staying at the local motel, which was a lot nicer than I expected it would be. It's only twenty dollars per night, so that was nice. We had our own room with two beds and everything. The bathroom was clean too, which was more than I could say for most places we've stayed at recently. My dad is usually pretty frugal when it comes to money, but when it came time to book this place he just wanted something cheap and reliable. I think it helped that he'd already paid for two nights when he made the reservation. After that, he told me, they wouldn't be able to refund him if he chose not to stay. So we were stuck here.
I spent most of the day today sitting outside in the parking lot across the street from the gas station that was right around the corner from the motel. There weren't many people around, so that was okay. My mom went inside to go do some shopping; I hadn't seen her since last night, although she did send my dad a text message to let him know where she was. She always does that. I'm kind of worried about her. I'm sure she's fine, but she doesn't strike me as the type to go off without telling anyone where she's going and who she's with. She never goes anywhere alone either. That might sound strange considering we don't really get along very well, but she still makes an effort to spend time with me. Not much, mind you... just enough that it seems like she cares.
I was watching the street through binoculars, waiting for someone to walk by wearing a hoodie like the ones they showed in the news report. But nobody did, and after an hour or so I decided to come back inside. I checked my phone, and I'd gotten a new message. It was from my mom.
Hey sweetie! Are you having fun? I'm sorry I haven't called yet, I forgot how long it takes for the phone to connect sometimes. It's been busy at work. But I'll see you tomorrow! Have a good day!
My mom works at a restaurant, and it was only seven o'clock when she sent me that message. She's not supposed to work until eight, but she said that there had been a lot of customers in lately. It must have been slow tonight if she's working this early. I replied that I was doing alright, and I hoped everything at work was going well.
She didn't reply immediately, but then she sent another text ten minutes later.
Oh yeah! The new menu's coming out soon, so that's exciting. I'm gonna try all of them! Ha ha.
There wasn't really any reason to write that, other than maybe to give herself something to talk about. And I know my mom's kind of quirky, but this isn't the usual stuff. Plus she always tries to make small talk like that, even with me. Usually about how much better her cooking is than my dad's. Or what kind of movies I like. I didn't really care though, so I just ignored the second text. I figured she'd just keep trying to chat with me like normal, so I left the phone in my pocket and went to take a nap.
I didn't dream at all, of course. My sleep was restless. I woke up a few times feeling like I needed to check the door, but each time I did I realized that the light outside was still the same as it had been the last time I checked. No cars were passing by, no footsteps or voices on the sidewalk. Nothing seemed to be happening out there at all, which was weird because I could hear the highway down below, and I'd expected it to be noisy with traffic. There was also the sound of people talking in the building above ours, but I couldn't tell exactly where they were. If there was anyone in our motel room, they were being quiet.
The rest of the day was uneventful. Mom texted me again before dinner to let me know that she was almost done shopping, so she didn't meet us for dinner. I guess it's a little awkward for us to eat together anyway... it's hard to talk to each other when we're both so stressed out. So I ate by myself. It turned out that it was actually pretty easy, since they only had one restaurant in town open. That meant they were short-staffed, so there wasn't anybody else around to bother me while I waited. I got to watch a show I'd recorded earlier, and then I went back to my room to get ready for bed. I took my phone out of my pocket and noticed that the text messages were gone.
It wasn't the first time my mom deleted a message without sending it, so I was used to it. It just annoyed me when she didn't explain why. I mean, what was the point of deleting them? What happened to the whole idea of transparency with her texts? She's always complaining about how bad the government is, but then she turns around and acts like she doesn't want anybody to know what she's texting me about. Like she doesn't want me to know her business, even if she doesn't mind showing it to everyone else.
After a few seconds I decided not to ask her about it again. I'd had a bad day, so I wanted to try to relax and get some sleep, and it's not like this was the first time she'd done something like this. Besides, I was probably getting paranoid. I put the phone back in my pocket and started to think about what I wanted to do tomorrow. Maybe I could find a way to sneak out and check the news.
But then I saw a flash of blue through my window. There was no one around, so I knew whatever it was couldn't be a person. I pulled up the binoculars to look out the window at the street below.",1231,-1.576440217591137,-1.661089704765511,-1.1575886761454333,-1.7029124537918126,0.22181190337530876
291,R_1gA7WDJq1dj2K0X,BAS_HR_7,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her eyes had met his, but she hadn't looked away as if she were afraid to look at anyone. He couldn't believe someone so beautiful could be so timid. And yet there she sat, looking around nervously, not daring to meet his gaze.
He knew that feeling well. It was how he felt whenever he went out with friends or family members. The fear that they would see who he really was. That they wouldn't accept him for what he was. But he wasn't going to let it stop him from trying to help this girl.
""What can I get you?"" he asked.
She didn't answer right away, just kept staring down at the table, her hands folded together. ""I'm sorry,"" she said finally. ""It's been a long day.""
""You don't have to order anything,"" he told her gently. ""Just sit here until you feel better.""
Her eyes flickered up to his again, and he thought he saw something in them—a hint of hope? Then she turned back to the table and took a deep breath before speaking. ""Thank you.""
A few minutes later, when she still hadn't ordered anything, he decided to go ahead and bring her whatever she wanted. When he got to the table, though, she was gone.
He searched the entire room, then the rest of the building, but he never found her. So he returned to work, wondering if maybe he'd imagined seeing her. Or maybe she'd left without paying for her meal.
But the next day, after he brought her food again, she came back. This time, she smiled at him as he approached. ""Do you always do that?"" she asked.
""Bring people their meals?""
""Yes.""
""No. Not usually.""
""Why not?""
""Because I've never seen anyone else do it.""
""Well, you should,"" she replied. ""People need to know that someone cares about them.""
That was all it took for him to start bringing people their food every day, even when they weren't regulars. It made him happy to make other people smile, and he hoped it helped them forget some of the things that were bothering them.
And he noticed something else. As more and more people started coming to the tavern each day, the ones who had been sitting alone began to talk to one another. They laughed together over drinks. Sometimes, they even shared stories.
By the end of the week, business was booming. People loved the new atmosphere in the place. And no one seemed to mind that the owner had changed.
They did notice, however, that he'd stopped wearing his mask.
""Are you okay?"" the woman who owned the tavern asked him one night.
He nodded. ""Yeah. I'm fine.""
She frowned. ""You're not sick or anything, are you?""
""No. Why would you think that?""
""Well, you haven't worn your mask since we opened, and now you don't seem to care whether anyone knows who you are.""
""I'm not hiding anything.""
""No, but—""
""I just want to help people.""
She stared at him for several moments. ""Okay,"" she said finally. ""Whatever you say.""
Over the next few weeks, word spread through the town about the man who brought everyone their food. Some people whispered behind his back, saying that he must be crazy to risk revealing himself to strangers. Others said he was brave.
As for the girl who'd started it all…well, he never saw her again. But he never forgot her.
After a while, he realized he needed to tell someone what he'd done. Who better than the girl herself? So he set off to find her. He walked past the tavern every day, hoping to catch a glimpse of her, but he never did.
One day, he spotted a familiar face in the window. He recognized it immediately. It was the girl he'd saved. She was sitting there, eating a meal by herself.
He stood there for a moment, debating whether to approach her or not. Finally, he stepped inside and sat down across from her.
""Hi,"" he said.
She looked up, startled. ""Hello,"" she said.
""Can I buy you lunch?""
She hesitated, then shook her head. ""I already ate.""
""Oh."" He felt disappointed. ""Well, I guess you'll have to eat again.""
She gave him a strange look. ""I don't understand.""
""You're hungry, aren't you?""
""Of course, but I don't need any more food.""
""Then why did you ask me to buy you lunch?""
She shrugged. ""I don't know.""
""Maybe you just wanted to see me again.""
""I don't know what you mean.""
""Look, you can either have my food, or you can leave.""
She sighed. ""Fine. I suppose you're right.""
""Good.""
He paid for her meal, which she accepted graciously, and then he took his tray outside. As he was walking away, she called out to him. ""Wait!""
He turned around. ""Yes?""
""Thank you,"" she said. ""For everything.""
""My pleasure.""
She watched him walk away, and then she went back inside.
That was the last time he ever saw her.

The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. They stopped just outside the village's walls and dismounted, tying their mounts off to an oak tree.
""Where are we?"" asked Argoen. ""What is this place?""
""I'm not sure,"" said Thane. He had his bow drawn and was looking around as if he expected trouble. ""It looks abandoned.""
Aron stepped forward and began walking towards the gate. As soon as he reached it he turned and walked back, motioning for everyone else to follow him.

Thane pointed down. In front of them, about halfway between the gate and the forest, was a large pool of water that was slowly turning black. There were several places where thin streams ran into it and then disappeared beneath the surface again.
""We need to go back!"" cried Argoen. ""That's poison! We can't drink it!""
""I don't think so,"" replied Thane. His eyes darted across the area and landed on one particular stream. ""There's something odd going on here.""
He walked over to the stream, crouched down next to it and splashed his hand in it.
""You're right,"" he said after a moment. ""This isn't poison, it's some sort of magic liquid.""
""Magic?"" asked Aron. ""But what does it do? Why would anyone pour something poisonous into a river?""
Thane shrugged. ""I have no idea. I've never seen anything like it before. I'll try and get a sample later, though.""
With that he stood and started heading towards the gate again.
""Wait!"" called out Aron. ""Let me come too.""
They continued on inside until they came to another set of wooden stairs leading up to the top floor of the tower. This time there was no door; instead, a single rope hung down from the ceiling, tied securely to the wall above them. They climbed up onto the first landing, which consisted of four stone pillars supporting a flat roof that was made of wood slats. On the other side of the room was another door. Thane approached it carefully, pulling out his dagger. When nothing happened, he opened the door and stepped through. Inside, a spiral staircase led upwards and a hallway stretched away ahead of them, ending in a pair of doors. Both of these doors were closed, however, so Thane moved on, searching the rest of the floor.
At the far end of the hall was another stairway that descended deeper underground. After taking a quick look around, he returned to the main part of the tower, closing the door behind him.
""What did you find?"" asked Aron.
""Nothing,"" he replied. ""Just a bunch of old junk. There was some sort of altar near the back that seemed important enough to keep, though. Let's take a closer look.""
Once they'd gathered everything together, Thane took a closer look at the altar. He couldn't identify any runes carved into it but that didn't mean much since he hadn't been raised among elves who knew how to read such things. The only thing that really caught his attention was the shape of the stone itself. It reminded him of a dragon's claw, although not quite as big. It felt heavy, too.
""Do you know what this might be?"" he asked Aron.
""No, but let's bring it with us anyway. It may turn out to be useful later.""
They carried it back upstairs, put it in a chest and locked it away. Once that was done they went downstairs and explored the rest of the upper floors. Nothing special stood out except for a very interesting book sitting on a table in one corner. Thane picked it up and flipped through it, reading bits of it aloud to the others.
""In the name of the Great Dragon, we shall raise the armies of our people and march against the enemies of the realm! By my blood, by my sword and by my axe, I swear allegiance to the Great Dragon and pledge myself to his service!""
Thane sighed. ""I don't suppose there are any more of those?""
The group searched around but found none. They finally decided to head back to the ground level and leave via the tunnel they'd entered through earlier. Before leaving, however, Aron took the book with him.
After getting back outside, they tied their horses up to a nearby tree and started following the trail. At first it followed the edge of the lake but soon diverged and headed eastward. As they traveled further and further inland, the air became cooler and thicker, becoming almost oppressive. Soon the path ended abruptly at the base of a cliff. It was hard to tell exactly how high it was because the trees grew close together on both sides. The only way down was to climb down a narrow ledge that had been cut into the side of the cliff. It wasn't long before they could hear the sound of running water below them, coming from somewhere deep within the forest.
""I thought this was supposed to be the River Tethys,"" remarked Aron. ""If that's true then we must be climbing upriver. How high are we now?""
""Hard to say,"" said Thane. ""I can see the tops of trees growing all the way to the sky.""
Aron looked up and whistled. ""Wow, this place is huge!""
Thane nodded. ""It looks like we've reached the mountain range that runs along the border between our kingdom and the empire of the dark elves.""
""Is that where we're going?"" asked Argoen. ""I hope not, because it doesn't look like the kind of place I want to visit.""
""Yeah,"" agreed Aron. ""Let's just stay here and wait for the rest of the party to catch up.""
""Why?"" asked Thane. ""We should continue on, find the others and go home. There's no telling what could happen if we stay here, especially if the dark elves decide to attack.""
""Don't you think it's a little early for that?"" questioned Aron. ""Maybe they just haven't figured out that the valley has changed hands yet.""
""Well, that's true, I guess,"" said Thane. ""Still, I'm worried about the dwarves. If they aren't here already, they probably will be soon.""
""What do you expect them to do?""
""I have no idea. Probably nothing. It seems like they usually just sit there and complain. Maybe they'll do that again, maybe they won't. I'm just glad they weren't on the same boat as us.""
Aron nodded in agreement and started walking down the slope towards the stream that ran beneath them. The rest of the party followed him, careful to watch where they stepped so they wouldn't fall off the edge.
""How are you feeling?"" asked Aron.
""Fine, thanks,"" replied Thane. ""What about you?""
""Good, I think. Just a bit tired, that's all.",1202,1.1028558786012173,0.5700587460435774,-0.3513250676842305,0.4001129609018832,0.35787130349451085
293,R_31noQJIvBM2SyXo,BAS_HR_5,Historical Romance,Basic Coherence,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He didn't know how she knew to go there—he had no idea who she was or why she would be sitting down with the other men of the village. But as soon as he realized that it was her, he couldn't look away from her. The way her hair fell around her shoulders, the shape of her body beneath those clothes...it was all too much for him to bear. And then she smiled at him. A smile that made his heart beat faster and his blood run hot.
He wanted nothing more than to get up from behind the bar and walk over to her table and take her into his arms. To kiss her until they were both breathless and sweaty and their hearts pounded against each other's chests. But he didn't move. Because he wasn't sure if she was someone else's woman, or even if she was married. So instead he stood there watching her drink her ale, smiling at the men around her, laughing when they told jokes. It took every ounce of control he possessed not to go over to her table and tell her how beautiful she looked. How he longed to see what color eyes she had under those thick lashes. How he wished he could touch her soft skin and feel the heat of her lips on his own.
But he didn't do any of those things. Instead, he watched her leave the tavern and make her way back home. Then he went back to work, trying to keep himself calm so that he wouldn't give anything away. But the next day, he found out exactly why she came into the tavern. Her husband had died during the night and left her alone with three small children to raise. Now she needed a place to stay while she figured out what she was going to do. And the only person who offered her a roof over her head and food in her belly was the man who had stared at her from afar all week.
And now here he was, standing outside her house, waiting for her to open the door. His hands clenched into fists as he waited for her to answer. When she did finally open the door, he was shocked by how lovely she was. Even though she wore a simple dress, it fit her perfectly. And her dark brown hair framed her face perfectly.
""Hello,"" he said, taking a step toward her. ""I'm sorry about your husband.""
She nodded, looking down at the floor. ""Thank you. I'll have to find another job. Something that will let me earn enough money to feed my family.""
""You can stay here for however long you need,"" he said, reaching for her hand. ""If you want to stay here, I mean. You don't have to worry about finding work right away. We can help you.""
Her eyes widened and she looked up at him. ""Really? Thank you!""
He grinned at her excitement. ""Of course. Come inside and we can talk. Tell me about yourself.""
She stepped forward and he pulled her into his arms, kissing her softly before letting her go. ""Come inside. Let me show you where everything is.""
Once she was safely inside, he closed the door behind them and turned around to look at her. She was still staring at him with wide eyes and he laughed. ""What?""
""Nothing,"" she replied, shaking her head. ""It's just...you're very handsome.""
He blushed. ""So are you.""
She giggled and he took her hand again, leading her through the house and showing her where everything was. There was a large bedroom upstairs, which he used as his own, and a smaller room off of the kitchen that he used as a guestroom. It was perfect for her, and he was glad that she liked it. He felt bad for asking her to sleep in the same bed as him, but he knew that it was better than having her sleeping on the floor somewhere.
When he showed her the bathroom, she gasped. ""This is amazing! I've never seen anything like this in my life.""
""I built it myself,"" he said proudly. ""My father taught me how to use some basic tools. I learned how to build things from him, and then I started building things for people in town. They paid me well for it, so I saved up and bought the supplies that I needed to build my own house. It took me almost two years, but I managed to finish it. And then I moved in here.""
""That's amazing,"" she breathed, touching the tiles of the wall. ""How did you learn to do all of this?""
""Well, my father was a carpenter and he always helped me whenever I asked for his advice,"" he explained. ""And he also taught me how to read and write, because he thought it was important for me to know how to read and write. My mother was an herbalist, and she taught me how to grow plants and care for animals. And I studied with the local priest, learning how to read the Bible and the books that he gave to us. So I guess you could say that I learned how to do most of these things from my parents.""
""Your father sounds wonderful,"" she said, smiling. ""And your mother must have been amazing, too, to teach you all of those skills.""
He nodded. ""Yes, she was. She loved me very much. And she was happy when she found out that she was pregnant with me. She told everyone in the village that she was expecting a son.""
""Oh, I'm so sorry,"" she murmured. ""I shouldn't have brought it up. It's not my place to ask questions like that.""
He shook his head. ""No, it's fine. I don't mind talking about it. In fact, I think it's good to talk about such things. It helps you remember what happened, and it makes you appreciate the people who were lost.""
She nodded slowly. ""All right. If you don't mind, I'd love to hear about it. Maybe it'll help me understand why you're so sad, and maybe it'll help me to know how to help you.""
""Okay,"" he said, nodding. ""Then tell me a little bit about yourself. What do you do for a living?""
""Well, I'm a seamstress,"" she said, pulling her skirt up to show him the embroidery on the hem. ""I make dresses, skirts, shirts, and pants. I also sew curtains and blankets.""
""Sounds nice,"" he said. ""What kind of dresses do you make?""
She smiled. ""Anything a woman might wear. Dresses for special occasions, or everyday clothes. Some of the women in the village buy my clothing, but most of the time I sell it to the merchants in town.",1173,0.6669141329302162,1.8688257691211854,-0.42708261052094354,1.0901189719601398,-0.12723735901115843
294,R_3nu7YkHPWRnnc7b,FAN_HR_6,Historical Romance,Fandango,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He could remember watching from behind as she ate the pie and drank the ale that had been on the table when he took it to her. The smell of her filled his nose, her scent reminding him that he needed to take a bath or something because the women around here were starting to talk about him. But then he saw her gaze lock onto someone across the room, her eyes darkening, turning to a deep brown hue that looked almost black against her skin. His eyes narrowed in irritation, and he wondered why she hadn't glanced at him as he waited for her to finish eating. Then she turned back and left before he could even say anything.
He didn't really care about the conversation going on behind him; he wanted to be alone with his thoughts so he could deal with the anger inside him. Anger he felt wasn't entirely his own. It came from a man who was supposed to be the king. The Kingmaker. The man everyone thought would be king, if it weren't for the bastard he fathered by another woman.
That bastard had been dead for years, but people still talked about him. And now that it was his brother who had taken the throne, everyone knew what kind of king he would be. A tyrant, no doubt, they said.
And that made the prince angry too. He wasn't a tyrant. He was a good, fair man—or so he told himself every day. But there was the problem of how to keep the people in line while he tried to govern them. If only there was someone else to help him out . . . someone who could speak the truth and get through to people in a way he couldn't. Someone who could also stand up for him whenever the situation demanded it.
Someone like the girl he'd seen earlier that day.
He sighed and went back to serving the patrons of the tavern. She was just another servant in town and he knew he was being ridiculous. Still, he couldn't help but find himself staring out the window every time she appeared. He found himself counting her steps and imagining what her hair looked like up close. He had to fight the urge to go after her when she left, and instead he just stood there with his eyes fixed on the door until she disappeared around a corner. He knew if he did follow, he wouldn't stop until he was in bed with her.
But he'd sworn he would never lie with a woman again. Besides, she was a servant anyway.
When he was younger, before he'd left for school, it had been different, for sure. His father had allowed it then, and all the other lords in the land did too. But not anymore. The Kingmaker's line was to have only the purest blood possible. Anyone who had a bastard child or a whore in their past was to be shunned, regardless of what position they held.
So the prince had vowed to be different. That he would live up to the expectations of all the men in the kingdom and show that he was worthy of rule by making a good life for himself without the help of a woman.
It was hard to resist temptation sometimes, especially when it looked as tempting as she did. He tried to tell himself he didn't care about her, but he knew that wasn't true. And now he was wondering what would happen if he did manage to get her into his bed. Would that make him more of an equal among the others? Or would it be like his brothers and father before him—another mark against him, making him seem weak and unfit to be king.
It was probably best if he left well enough alone. He had to put this feeling behind him so that he would never fall prey to the same temptation again. For now, he decided, he'd pretend he didn't know she was in town.
When he was a few years older, if he was still alive—which was still a long shot given the odds he was up against—he would make his move and be done with it.
He watched the door intently when he served the customers. He waited for a moment after the girl left, then slipped outside and hurried down the street after her. He was glad he was dressed up for dinner tonight and wearing his best clothes. At least that part of his plan would work.
His footfalls were quiet, but he was still able to catch up with the woman. ""Good evening,"" he said when he caught up to her.
She smiled at him, and he immediately felt like an idiot. How could anyone smile at him? She was beautiful beyond compare. ""You can call me Sela.""
He swallowed hard. Had he heard her correctly? ""Yes?""
""My name is Sela.""
""Sela."" He cleared his throat. What was he going to do? Just walk away and pretend he hadn't seen her? Maybe he should just head back inside and forget about her altogether.
She looked at the tavern. ""Your name, sir?""
""I'm sorry? What did you say?"" He'd missed her question completely.
She raised her eyebrows. ""I asked you your name, my lord. You can't just ignore me.""
He shook his head. ""No. I don't know what I was thinking, but yes, my name is Marcus.""
Her smile widened. ""Marcus,"" she repeated. ""I like that. It suits you.""
""Thank you."" He had a lot on his mind, and he wasn't sure he was capable of talking to her. So far, she'd seemed nice enough, but he wasn't sure if he would ever be able to see her as anything more than the servant from the tavern.
""Well, Marcus, it seems we're both headed in the same direction.""
He stared at her. Was she suggesting they stay together? It seemed like it, but then again, maybe that was just wishful thinking on his part.
""You're heading home?"" she asked.
""Yes.""
She nodded. ""Me too.""
He was surprised when she walked with him instead of walking away from him like she normally would have. He kept his arms crossed over his chest as he continued to watch her, waiting for her to turn into the alleyways and disappear. When he saw her continue to lead the way, he was certain it must be some sort of trap.
She turned a corner right after she answered him, and he found himself staring into a courtyard. A large building was situated beside it.
""Here we are,"" she announced. ""This is where I live.""
Home? He was amazed. ""How old are you, if you don't mind my asking?""
She smiled, pleased by the fact that he cared about her age. He wondered if she had a boyfriend and hoped she did.
""I'm sixteen.""
He grinned. ""I guess we're almost the same age.""
She looked down at his hands and then back up into his face. ""Are you single?""",1218,-0.9512092900519223,-0.560203760565944,0.21789520585354966,-0.21726744931906794,-0.9111823634032652
295,R_1gUdCxNaLajzDRk,MOR_HSF_10,Hard Sci-Fi,Morpho,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
The rest of the day, however, was spent on another project. I was working on the code that would ultimately make it possible to communicate with the rest of the world, both on Earth and in space. Of course, I didn't have time to do so at the moment, seeing as I had to meet with the president of Mars.
It was not difficult to find his office, but I had to wait in a queue for a while before I got inside. It was not long until his secretary called me in, and I was asked to sit down and wait again.
The president's office was rather small, perhaps two or three meters by four. A man sat at a desk at one end, and another stood by the door. He was probably part of the secret service. When I saw that, I thought for a moment that I was going to be arrested.
""I'm sorry about all this,"" said a voice from behind me. ""It's just that we get so many visitors that we need to be careful.""
The man who had spoken to me was tall and thin, with light brown hair that looked like it had been combed straight back. He wore a suit that looked like it had been tailored for him specifically.
""If you'd like, you could go down to the cafeteria and get something to eat while you wait,"" he said. ""It's on the third floor.""
I stood up and followed him up the stairs, past a few more secretaries who were busy at work. On the third floor there was a vending machine, and it offered food from Earth. I bought a few sandwiches and then returned to my seat.
I ate my sandwiches while waiting for my turn to see the president. I did not want to be rude and leave without eating, but I wanted to be on time for my meeting with him.
Finally, after what felt like hours, it was my turn to meet with him. He had told me he would only have time for a quick chat, and he did not disappoint.
""Hello,"" he said and shook my hand when I got to his desk. ""My name is President Thomas Rochat. How are you?""
""Fine, thank you,"" I said as I looked at him and offered him my hand in return. ""My name is Dr. Adam Thomas.""
""I know who you are,"" he said as he shook my hand firmly. ""I'd heard some things about you from Dr. Sato.""
""Is that right?"" I asked him as I looked at him for a moment. ""What did she say?""
""She said that you were working on something really important.""
""That's right,"" I told him with a smile on my face. ""I'm working on a program that will allow us to communicate with people on Earth.""
""Is that right?"" he asked again. ""That's great! When do you think it will be finished?""
""We're not quite sure yet,"" I said as I tried not to sound like I was lying to him. ""We're hoping it will be ready by next week.""
""That'll be amazing!"" he said with a smile on his face. ""I can't wait to see it!""
We talked for a while longer, and then he gave me an envelope with his personal seal on it and told me that he hoped everything went well with my project.
I walked out of his office and then went back downstairs to get something to eat. My head was spinning because of all the information I had just learned about him, but I wasn't really sure what was true and what wasn't. However, even if the man was not actually president of Mars, he certainly acted like he was in charge there.
As soon as I got back upstairs though, the secretary called me into his office again to tell me that they wanted me to start work on Monday morning in order to be ready for when the program was ready. She handed me another envelope with my new office address written on it before telling me goodbye and wishing me good luck with my project.
I walked back down the stairs and out of the building for the last time until Monday morning when I arrived at my new workstation on Mars' Red Planet in order to begin my new job as an IT specialist in space communications.<|endoftext|>

296,R_2qBN7ejEECY0sGn,ACE_HOR_6,Horror,Ace of Spade,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was an old woman's face with deep wrinkles all around her eyes and mouth. Her skin was white and she had gray hair that stuck straight up in the air like she'd been electrocuted. She didn't have any eyebrows or eyelashes. I backed away slowly so as not to scare her. The sound of knocking came again. This time, when I turned my head to look for the source, there were two more faces in the mirror, each one older than the last. They were staring right through me, trying to get closer. I started to shake as I realized they weren't just people; these were ghosts!
""Please don't hurt me,"" I begged them, ""please go away."" But the ghostly figures kept coming closer and closer, their faces getting larger and larger until they were right in front of me. They pushed against my chest. I could feel them pushing down, trying to force themselves inside me. Their hands reached under my arms and pulled me forward. There was nothing I could do except let them pull me towards the mirror. As we got close enough to see each other, the three ghosts began talking to each other in whispers. One of them spoke louder than the others. ""You can't stop us!"" he said. ""We're already here!"" He laughed at his own joke then pushed himself deeper inside of me. I screamed as loud as I possibly could but no one came running. No one heard me scream because no one else was home. The ghost pushed harder and faster now. I tried to run but couldn't move fast enough before he caught me. My feet were moving, but I wasn't making any progress. Soon, he was pulling me along by my neck and I could tell I would be dead soon if something didn't happen quickly. Then I felt myself being lifted off the ground, carried like a rag doll to the mirror. Before I knew what happened, I was standing in the mirror, looking back at the ghosts. They grabbed my legs and held me up while the man who'd spoken to me earlier went behind me and shoved his fingers inside my body. He wiggled them around like he was feeling around for something. His hand finally found something, and he yanked hard. Out popped a small object and he threw it onto the floor. It rolled across the floor, stopping about ten feet away from where I stood. A smile spread across the ghost's face as he pointed at the object and made a noise. It sounded like the noise you make when someone says your name and you turn around to find them standing behind you. I knew this was bad news. I knew exactly what it meant. These ghosts were going to kill me! I wanted to cry, but I had no tears left.
The ghost picked up the object and showed it to me. It was a large ring. It looked expensive. He put it on his finger, turning it to show me how shiny and pretty it was. Then he took another ring out of his pocket and placed it next to it. They both shone in the light from the street lamp outside. The first ghost turned back to me. ""This is why we're here,"" he said, ""and this is why you will die."" He raised his hand above my head, and I braced myself for the worst. Instead, he slammed his fist down on top of my head, causing me to fall to the floor. He picked me up off the floor and set me down on the chair. Then he told the other two ghosts to leave. The two ghosts disappeared and the man turned back to me. ""Now,"" he said, ""you must give us everything you have.""
""No way am I giving you anything,"" I replied. ""Get out of my house and take those rings with you. If you don't want to do that, then I'm afraid I'll have to call the police.""
He smiled and shook his head. ""Oh, dearie, you won't need to do that."" He opened a drawer in the dresser beside him. He pulled out a gun and aimed it directly at my forehead.
""If I have to shoot you,"" he continued, ""then so be it. You may not be able to escape me."" He pressed the trigger, but the gun wouldn't fire. The ghost gave me a wicked grin and shrugged his shoulders. ""What a shame,"" he said, ""but I guess I should have known better than to think you would actually give us anything. After all, we are the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future."" With that, he waved his hand and I fell unconscious.
When I woke up, I was lying on my couch with the blanket covering my head. I sat up and saw the man sitting in the same place as he'd been when I fell asleep. He had the gun in his lap and he was holding the ring in his hand. He glanced at me, then at the ring, then back to me again. I pretended to sleep. I waited for him to make some kind of move.
""Do you know who I am?"" he asked.
I nodded. ""Of course. That's why I'm here to kill you.""
""Don't be foolish,"" he said. ""Why would you want to kill me? What does it matter to you anyway? You're a ghost, aren't you?""
""Yes,"" I admitted, ""I am, and I want to kill you very badly.""
""That's good,"" he said, ""because I want to kill you, too.""
""Well,"" I said, ""if you're the ghost of Christmas future, then I hope you don't mind me killing you.""
""Actually,"" he said, ""that's one thing I don't mind. In fact, I welcome death.""
""Good,"" I said. ""Then maybe I'll just wait for you to kill yourself. Then I'll be rid of both of you.""
""I don't plan to kill myself,"" he said, ""not unless you force me to.""
""How did you get into my house, anyway?""
""It doesn't really matter,"" he answered. ""All that matters is that I've been sent to collect your soul.""
""You mean to say you're a demon?""
""I suppose that's what I am,"" he answered, ""though I prefer the term ghost.""
""Well,"" I said, ""don't worry. I don't have any intention of handing my soul over to you.""
""That's the spirit,"" he said. ""But I don't think you realize how serious things are. The last time I visited you, I came to warn you about the evil spirits and demons you were inviting into your life. This time, I'm here to deliver the final warning.""
""So, what is the final warning?"" I asked.
""The only reason you're still alive,"" he explained, ""is because the spirits haven't decided yet whether or not they want to claim your soul.""

She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her eyes were bright blue and clear as summer water; her skin so white that it almost looked translucent. And yet there was an unmistakable hint of strength and vitality behind those eyes. He had been staring at her for several minutes before he realized what he was doing and turned away with an embarrassed cough.
It didn't occur to him until later that he should have asked for her name or given her his own. The only reason he could think of was that she looked familiar to him—but he couldn't imagine why. He knew all the men who worked in the tavern, and none of them fit the description. He thought about her all the rest of the night, wondering if she might be a guest of the inn, but he couldn't imagine who would put a girl of sixteen into an inn with three men of questionable character.
He never saw her again. The next day when he went to work at the tavern, he told himself he'd never seen her there before. But he couldn't quite believe it.
When he came home late that night, his father was waiting for him. ""I need you to do me a favor,"" he said. ""Take my horse and go out to the woods by the lake and see if you can find a young woman who's lost her way.""
The boy nodded, not understanding. ""Do you know which woman?"" he asked.
""No. I don't remember her name. But she was here yesterday, asking about a woman named Ayla.""
The boy nodded and saddled up the horse. ""Where are you going?"" his father asked.
""To the lake,"" he answered.
He rode out through the village and into the countryside. When he reached the edge of the forest, he looked around carefully. There was a trail that led down to a small cove where there was a beach and a stream, but there were no people in sight. He dismounted, tied the horse to a tree, and walked toward the water. It was a bright day; the sky was clear and blue, the air warm enough to feel almost hot. The water sparkled and gleamed under the sunlight. He waded in and let the coldness of it soak into his skin. The sun warmed him; he could hear the sound of birds singing as they flew from one tree to another. It was peaceful, but he wasn't sure what he was looking for. He didn't think he would recognize her if she were standing right in front of him, and even if he did, he wondered if it was worth bothering her. She probably had other things on her mind.
Then he heard someone crying. It was faint at first, but then he realized that she must be very close to him. He followed the sound, keeping his eyes open for any sign of the woman. Suddenly he saw her. She was sitting on the ground by the shore, her head bowed. Her hair was long and thick, a beautiful pale blond, and it was all over her face. He went over to her and sat down next to her.
""Can I help you?"" he asked.
She didn't say anything. He tried to take her hand, but it was still tangled in her hair, so he took her shoulder instead. He couldn't see her face because of all the strands of hair in the way. ""What's your name?"" he asked.
""I don't remember.""
""Well, what do you remember? How old are you?""
She shook her head.
He waited a moment and then said, ""I'm going to take off your hair and untangle it. That way we'll know who you are.""
She nodded.
He untangled her hair carefully, pulling some of the strands out of her face and placing them in her lap. As he worked, she looked up at him, and he could see the sadness in her eyes. Her face was pale; she had small, delicate features, with high cheekbones and wide-set green eyes.
""Who were you looking for?"" he asked.
She just shook her head again.
""You can tell me,"" he said.
She looked away. ""I don't want to talk about it.""
""Why not?""
She hesitated for a few moments and then said, ""My mother is dead.""
He thought for a moment before asking, ""Is your father alive?""
""No.""
""Where does your father live?""
She shook her head.
The boy nodded. ""It's okay. I won't tell anyone.""
After a moment he said, ""Your name is Ayla?""
""Yes.""
He smiled. ""How did you get here?""
She shrugged. ""I don't remember.""
""Did you come with a friend? Someone named Jondalar?""
""I think so.""
""What kind of animal are you?""
Ayla didn't understand. ""What kind of animal?""
The boy laughed. ""Do you know how people in your village live?""
""No.""
""People have animals that help them hunt and gather food and build their homes, but they also use horses for riding or for pulling sledges when they're traveling long distances."" He stopped talking, not sure if he'd explained himself clearly.
She nodded. ""Yes.""
""Do you know what a horse looks like?""
She shook her head.
""Well, it's an animal, not a person, but it's very strong. It's much bigger than any animal in your village—much bigger than anything you've ever seen. When a person is riding a horse, the horse has to carry all their weight. But the rider doesn't have to do any of the work. All they have to do is hold on and trust that the horse knows what it's doing."" He looked at her, and she nodded.
""Jondalar has a horse just like that,"" he went on. ""His is called a zebu, but I think he's going to call his new one a mare because it was born this year. It's a very good horse, and he's very proud of it. His father gave him the mare, but she came from a different village. The man who brought the mare wanted to buy Jondalar's mother, but Jondalar didn't want to sell her, so he traded her instead.""
Ayla thought about the story the boy told her. ""So you were looking for your mother's horse? You don't know where your mother is?""
The boy shrugged. ""I think she might be dead. She disappeared two years ago, and nobody has heard anything since.""
""Did anyone try to look for her?""
""My father did,"" he answered. ""But he couldn't find her.",1116,-0.24924612507062147,0.32451605941417755,0.918597633809524,0.3290905547337466,0.7175310061520519
298,R_2mDwm3eMvl9oFsl,MOR_HF_7,High Fantasy,Morpho,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Where are the people?"" asked Elenari.
""They left,"" said Eadric. ""They did not want to live with the monsters and the demons. They fled to the city of Haldis.""
""The city of Haldis is nothing but a ruin now,"" said one of the men. ""The demons did that. We can see it from here."" He pointed to the north, where the mountains rose up like a wall.
""We are not staying here,"" said Elenari. ""We're going on.""
""You cannot go on,"" said Eadric. ""The demons are worse than the monsters. If you stay here, you will die.""
""We don't have a choice,"" said Elenari. ""We can't just leave them here to die.""
""You can if you wish,"" said Eadric. ""But I cannot.""
""You'll be killed if you stay,"" said the lead man. ""There are monsters here now. They are more powerful than those in the city of Haldis.""
""You'll be killed if you try to leave,"" said another man.
""What choice do we have?"" asked Elenari. ""We have to leave this place, before we're killed.""
""The demons have come to this valley, but they cannot leave it,"" said Eadric. ""They cannot go further in without crossing a river, and they cannot cross a river without a boat. The river is too wide, and too deep for them to cross on foot.""
""They're powerful,"" said one of the men. ""They have killed thousands of people who tried to cross the river.""
It was true, thought Elenari. The monsters were stronger now than they had been in the city of Haldis, and with no one to fight them they were able to wreak even more havoc on those who lived here.
""They will kill us all,"" said Elenari. ""We need to find a boat that can take us across.""
The boatman nodded at her words but had no more to say about it. He pointed back down the valley to the village and then motioned for them to follow him into the forest that lined the valley's edge.
They walked slowly, their eyes on the ground for signs of danger, or for signs of a boat that could take them across the river, but the man kept his silence and his eyes on the forest. They were soon lost in the dense undergrowth of the forest that covered this side of the valley. The trees were large and gnarled, and their branches grew so low that they almost reached the ground, making it difficult for Elenari and her companions to walk through without falling over them. The leaves were long and twisted, and their colours were dark, almost black, as though they too had seen many years, their leaves hanging limp and lifeless from their branches like old, wet clothes from a clothes line. If Elenari hadn't been looking at them closely she would have thought they were dead and dried out from lack of water and sunlight.
The man led them deeper into the forest and soon they noticed that there was hardly any light left in the sky as they entered a dark green tunnel of dense undergrowth and leaves that blocked out all light from above. Elenari had never seen anything like it before, she had never been in such a dense forest before, and she found it difficult to imagine that the valley they'd just left was only a few miles away from here. She found herself wishing that she had her sword out with her, for then she would be able to cut her way through this forest if she had to, but she'd left her sword with Eadric when he'd insisted on carrying her on his back when he carried her up into the hills after she'd fainted from exhaustion after being injured by one of the monsters on their way up into these mountains. She was glad that he hadn't left her alone with them, but she felt vulnerable without her sword at her side and she wondered how long it would be before she was attacked by some demon or monster she couldn't see around her.
There was nothing for it though but to keep moving forward, for if they stopped they would surely be attacked by whatever was hiding in these trees, and she didn't think they would have much of a chance against whatever might be hunting them through these trees at night in these parts; especially if it had already killed so many people who had tried to cross this river and lived here in this valley before them.
It started to rain as they moved deeper into the forest, leaving all of them soaked in moments as their clothes started to cling to them and soak up the moisture from the ground beneath their feet. They continued walking through the forest for what felt like an eternity as darkness seemed to fall on them all at once, but when they stopped walking they could see little more than their own shadows cast against the trees around them as they moved forward in silence through this strange forest that seemed alive with dark magic and evil spirits who would kill anyone who ventured too far into it without weapons or armour to protect themselves against its dark magic and evil spirits – or so it seemed anyway; but what Elenari could see of this forest was frightening enough for her. She didn't want to believe that this was just an old story being told by those who lived in these parts, telling tales of what might be waiting for someone who ventured into this forest at night without protection against its dark magic and dangerous spirits, but after what she'd seen back in Haldis she no longer had any doubts about it being just an old story being told by those who lived in these parts, trying to protect their loved ones from what lurked in these woods under cover of night when all was quiet within its depths; but what about those who lived here? Had they ever encountered any evil here in these woods? Had they ever seen such dark magic as there seemed to be here in this forest? Had any of them ever crossed a river without a boat? Had they ever encountered such monsters as there seemed to be here? Were they all just stories told by those who lived here?",1139,1.00709831290818,1.2306691632688833,-0.7495820340996506,0.27449527501454063,1.2859891199331475
299,R_3P5BOUJvkMv5bkJ,GEN_HF_7,High Fantasy,Genesis,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. The place had the feel of being abandoned years ago and left as if in a hurry with everything still where it should have been—if not exactly in its proper place.
""This is your home?"" Dara asked, looking around her. She glanced back over her shoulder at her mother who was riding behind them in the wagon, staring ahead intently. ""Where are we going anyway? I don't see anyone else around.""
""We're going to stay here,"" Lark replied, glancing down at his daughter. ""At least until the winter storms pass and things settle down again. We'll have to wait until spring before we can return to our own lands and leave you there safely in Lord Kaltar's care.""
Dara blinked in surprise. ""But why would he let us stay here? He has no reason to help us.""
Lark smiled at her, as if she were a clever little girl instead of an eleven-year old girl. ""You will find that many people do things without any reason for doing so beyond simply wanting to give to others what they themselves wish to receive.""
Dara rolled her eyes. ""That sounds like a very selfish way of thinking.""
He shrugged. ""I suppose it is. But perhaps it is a trait that should be encouraged because without it, life would be too short to enjoy.""
She stared at him in disbelief. ""What are you talking about?""
""Come now, my dear,"" Lark said, nodding toward the silent village. ""Don't you want to explore a bit more?""
Dara shook her head. ""No, I'm tired and hungry and just want to go home.""
""Well then, let's get this show on the road,"" Lark said, clapping his hands together loudly. His smile widened as both horses snorted in protest. ""Let's go!""
Dara didn't move and only stared back at him blankly. ""Why are you being so nice to me today?"" she finally asked. ""You've never done anything like this before. You usually yell at me whenever I ask questions or make mistakes. Why is it different now?""
Lark hesitated for a moment before responding. ""Perhaps it is because I know you are going to grow up one day and become a great mage. Then you will be able to do whatever you please and make your own choices.""
""But won't I always need you?"" she pressed.
""Of course you will,"" he said quietly. ""Your father and I are your parents. We love you and want nothing but the best for you.""
""Then why do you have to send me away?""
Lark sighed and looked away. ""Because you are going to change, my child, and change is not something that can be stopped once it begins. Sometimes, the world needs children to become adults, and you are going to have to learn how to control yourself, even if you are not ready to yet. And sometimes, you will have to do things you don't want to just like we did.""
""Like what?"" Dara asked.
Lark laughed softly. ""Well, I'm afraid you are going to have to learn to trust in the kindness of strangers rather than trying to take care of everything yourself.""
Dara frowned. ""I don't understand.""
""There comes a time in every young person's life when they must leave the nest and begin to fly,"" he answered. ""It is a natural part of growing up. You cannot stay with your family forever, Dara, and they cannot live in your heart forever. You have to find your own path in this world. It is the way of things.""
""And if I don't want to leave?"" she asked.
Lark turned his gaze upon her and smiled sadly. ""Then you won't.""
Dara felt tears welling up in her eyes. ""But I don't want to!"" she cried. ""I hate leaving my home and everyone I know! I don't want to be alone in the middle of nowhere!""
Lark took her hand in his and squeezed it gently. ""I am sorry, Dara,"" he whispered. ""When the time comes, I will try to make sure it isn't a surprise.""
Dara turned away from him and stared at the village. She wanted to run back to her mother and tell her everything but couldn't find the words. Instead, she simply buried her face in Lark's chest and silently wept.
After a while, Lark spoke softly in her ear. ""Do you not believe me when I say that I love you and only want what is best for you?""
Dara wiped the tears from her cheeks and sniffled. ""Yes, I do,"" she replied. ""I guess I am just having a hard time believing that you really mean it.""
Lark smiled and kissed the top of her head. ""Then perhaps we should make it easier for you to believe in the goodness of others. Let's go inside and have lunch.""
Dara nodded and wiped her nose on the sleeve of her tunic, then stood up and followed her father into the village.
Two days later, the three of them were walking down the main street of the town, headed for the inn. Dara was wearing a simple dress with a blue silk blouse and matching shoes. Her hair was pulled back in two ponytails on either side of her head and tied with ribbons. She carried a basket filled with bread and cheese, carrots and apples, and a jar of honey. Her mother and father had put on their finest clothes, but Lark hadn't bothered since they were just traveling through the area.
A large crowd was gathered outside the inn. Several men were arguing hotly with each other and several others were shaking their fists angrily at the ground. As they drew closer, Dara recognized Lord Kaltar among the group. He was standing next to his cousin, the man who had come to fetch Dara and her parents after she had fallen off her horse.
""What is happening?"" Dara asked.
""Oh, we're just having a little disagreement about the best way to treat livestock,"" Kaltar answered. ""Mostly, though, it seems to boil down to which of us is most stubborn."" He shot a quick glance at Lark. ""I'm sure you know the answer to that question.""
Lark laughed lightly. ""Indeed I do, Lord Kaltar. There is no doubt about it. You are completely incorrigible.""
Kaltar stepped forward and bowed deeply. ""How are you, my friend?"" he asked.
""Well enough,"" Lark replied. ""We are traveling to the south, if you recall.""
""Ah yes,"" Kaltar said. ""I do remember your visit. I hope you will be staying in my village long enough for me to visit you again.""
Lark chuckled.",1177,-0.49041205704093555,-0.707463833004382,-1.788843270376442,0.23062077787487142,-0.2373356385417439
300,R_3hbX4zeHOg8vaaU,ACE_HOR_6,Horror,Ace of Spade,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was an old woman's face with deep wrinkles all around her eyes and mouth. Her skin was white and she had gray hair that stuck straight up in the air like she'd been electrocuted. She didn't have any eyebrows or eyelashes. I backed away slowly so as not to scare her. The sound of knocking came again. This time, when I turned my head to look for the source, there were two more faces in the mirror, each one older than the last. They were staring right through me, trying to get closer. I started to shake as I realized they weren't just people; these were ghosts!
""Please don't hurt me,"" I begged them, ""please go away."" But the ghostly figures kept coming closer and closer, their faces getting larger and larger until they were right in front of me. They pushed against my chest. I could feel them pushing down, trying to force themselves inside me. Their hands reached under my arms and pulled me forward. There was nothing I could do except let them pull me towards the mirror. As we got close enough to see each other, the three ghosts began talking to each other in whispers. One of them spoke louder than the others. ""You can't stop us!"" he said. ""We're already here!"" He laughed at his own joke then pushed himself deeper inside of me. I screamed as loud as I possibly could but no one came running. No one heard me scream because no one else was home. The ghost pushed harder and faster now. I tried to run but couldn't move fast enough before he caught me. My feet were moving, but I wasn't making any progress. Soon, he was pulling me along by my neck and I could tell I would be dead soon if something didn't happen quickly. Then I felt myself being lifted off the ground, carried like a rag doll to the mirror. Before I knew what happened, I was standing in the mirror, looking back at the ghosts. They grabbed my legs and held me up while the man who'd spoken to me earlier went behind me and shoved his fingers inside my body. He wiggled them around like he was feeling around for something. His hand finally found something, and he yanked hard. Out popped a small object and he threw it onto the floor. It rolled across the floor, stopping about ten feet away from where I stood. A smile spread across the ghost's face as he pointed at the object and made a noise. It sounded like the noise you make when someone says your name and you turn around to find them standing behind you. I knew this was bad news. I knew exactly what it meant. These ghosts were going to kill me! I wanted to cry, but I had no tears left.
The ghost picked up the object and showed it to me. It was a large ring. It looked expensive. He put it on his finger, turning it to show me how shiny and pretty it was. Then he took another ring out of his pocket and placed it next to it. They both shone in the light from the street lamp outside. The first ghost turned back to me. ""This is why we're here,"" he said, ""and this is why you will die."" He raised his hand above my head, and I braced myself for the worst. Instead, he slammed his fist down on top of my head, causing me to fall to the floor. He picked me up off the floor and set me down on the chair. Then he told the other two ghosts to leave. The two ghosts disappeared and the man turned back to me. ""Now,"" he said, ""you must give us everything you have.""
""No way am I giving you anything,"" I replied. ""Get out of my house and take those rings with you. If you don't want to do that, then I'm afraid I'll have to call the police.""
He smiled and shook his head. ""Oh, dearie, you won't need to do that."" He opened a drawer in the dresser beside him. He pulled out a gun and aimed it directly at my forehead.
""If I have to shoot you,"" he continued, ""then so be it. You may not be able to escape me."" He pressed the trigger, but the gun wouldn't fire. The ghost gave me a wicked grin and shrugged his shoulders. ""What a shame,"" he said, ""but I guess I should have known better than to think you would actually give us anything. After all, we are the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future."" With that, he waved his hand and I fell unconscious.
When I woke up, I was lying on my couch with the blanket covering my head. I sat up and saw the man sitting in the same place as he'd been when I fell asleep. He had the gun in his lap and he was holding the ring in his hand. He glanced at me, then at the ring, then back to me again. I pretended to sleep. I waited for him to make some kind of move.
""Do you know who I am?"" he asked.
I nodded. ""Of course. That's why I'm here to kill you.""
""Don't be foolish,"" he said. ""Why would you want to kill me? What does it matter to you anyway? You're a ghost, aren't you?""
""Yes,"" I admitted, ""I am, and I want to kill you very badly.""
""That's good,"" he said, ""because I want to kill you, too.""
""Well,"" I said, ""if you're the ghost of Christmas future, then I hope you don't mind me killing you.""
""Actually,"" he said, ""that's one thing I don't mind. In fact, I welcome death.""
""Good,"" I said. ""Then maybe I'll just wait for you to kill yourself. Then I'll be rid of both of you.""
""I don't plan to kill myself,"" he said, ""not unless you force me to.""
""How did you get into my house, anyway?""
""It doesn't really matter,"" he answered. ""All that matters is that I've been sent to collect your soul.""
""You mean to say you're a demon?""
""I suppose that's what I am,"" he answered, ""though I prefer the term ghost.""
""Well,"" I said, ""don't worry. I don't have any intention of handing my soul over to you.""
""That's the spirit,"" he said. ""But I don't think you realize how serious things are. The last time I visited you, I came to warn you about the evil spirits and demons you were inviting into your life. This time, I'm here to deliver the final warning.""
""So, what is the final warning?"" I asked.
""The only reason you're still alive,"" he explained, ""is because the spirits haven't decided yet whether or not they want to claim your soul."" He paused and I thought for sure he was going to continue, but he didn't.",1215,0.8039828376032323,0.8089338237822283,1.767795367292855,0.5177333803451064,0.3909452755542859
301,R_2uwU8Iu3mRVMTJ1,ALL_HF_3,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Where is everybody?"" Kari asked as they rode up to the gates of the settlement. She dismounted and tied her horse to a nearby tree while her companions did the same.
""This place is abandoned,"" Cael said. ""I don't think I've ever been this close to one before."" He looked around as he walked down from his horse. ""It's eerie. You'd think there would be people here if this was the center of a kingdom.""
Kari shrugged, then nodded at something behind him. ""Well, let's see what we can find inside those towers.""
They walked toward them and passed between the tall wooden gates, which had no locks on them. They went inside the first tower, which had an open courtyard in front of it. There were three doors leading off of it, one at each corner and one in the middle that led to stairs spiraling up to the second floor. The second building looked much the same, with the exception of more doors. There were two staircases that led to the third floor, but these had no doors on them. Kari and her friends went to the first door on the left and opened it.
Inside they found a large, open room with a table in the center of it. There were three chairs and a couple of stools scattered about the room, but none of them appeared to have been used for some time. The air was stale and there didn't seem to be any way to light a fire, so it was probably cold inside. A few candles sat on the table and were lit by magic. Kari went to the far wall and studied the paintings on it. There were a lot of them, but they all depicted the same scene: a dark-haired woman dressed in a robe similar to Kari's standing in front of a large house. The walls were covered with paintings of that scene as well, along with others showing different aspects of the woman's life.
""The Queen of the Tethys,"" Kari said, recognizing the picture of the woman from the mural in the temple of Iyesta.
""I'm sure she is, though I don't know why she would be here,"" Cael said.
Kari took her sword belt off and set it aside, then walked over to the center of the room. ""Maybe this is her shrine?""
""She doesn't look like she needs one,"" Cael said, following Kari.
""I've heard stories about her, but I never expected to actually see anything like this."" Kari moved around the room and touched a few of the paintings, looking for some kind of inscription or clue. ""If she's been dead for years, I wonder what happened to her kingdom? This place looks like it's abandoned.""
""Perhaps someone killed her,"" Cael suggested. ""That would explain the lack of people and the smoke from the chimneys. It's probably hard to maintain a country if you're dead.""
""It does look deserted,"" Kari agreed. ""But I think we need to check out those other towers before we give up on this place. Come on.""
They left the central room and made their way back into the courtyard. Cael was looking at the painting on the wall, which showed the queen with her hands raised toward the sky.
""What's this supposed to mean?"" he asked.
""She's praying to Iyesta,"" Kari told him. ""It's the same as the mural in the temple of Iyesta.""
""So this is where all the people of the Tethys are?"" Cael asked.
""I don't think they've been here for a long time, but maybe the queen's followers have been coming here to pray to their goddess. Maybe there's some sort of cult that worships her, and that's why she has so many paintings of herself on the walls.""
Cael shrugged, then went to the second door on the left and opened it. The stairs spiraled upward and ended in a small hallway with a door leading off to either side. They started up the steps, but stopped when the smell hit them. It was a foul, acrid stench of death, and it brought back memories of the time they'd encountered the demon-possessed man in the city of Ero. Kari looked down the stairwell and saw another set of doors leading off of the hall.
""That must be the place,"" Cael said, pointing to the other door. He went inside and Kari followed, then shut the door behind them. Inside, the room was just as barren as the one on the ground floor, but there were no paintings or anything else to suggest any kind of worship or reverence for the queen. They moved back down the stairs and headed over to the third tower, which was a bit larger than the first two. This one had three doors in a row on the ground floor, and each door led off of the hallway into a smaller room. Cael opened the door on the right and looked around inside.
""This looks like an armory,"" he said, looking through several chests that lined the wall. ""There's armor, weapons, bows and arrows, shields, even some swords. I wonder why nobody is using them?""
""Maybe they're not allowed to,"" Kari suggested. She walked up to the other door and opened it. A long table ran along the far wall of the room, with chairs set at the opposite end of it. There was a small fireplace in the corner, and a single chair sat next to it. In front of the chair stood a tall, thin man wearing a plain robe and sandals. His hair was dark and cut short, and his face was thin and angular.
""You are trespassing,"" the man said when he saw Kari and her friends enter. He held up one hand, and his eyes began to glow with a golden light. ""Do you wish to die?""
Kari lifted her sword and took a step forward. ""We don't mean you any harm.""
The man continued to hold up his hand and Kari could see that there was a blue glow emanating from it. ""I have been instructed to kill trespassers,"" he said, ""and so I will do my duty.""
""I'm not going to ask you to lay down your sword,"" Kari said as she kept moving toward him. ""But if you come at me again, I will be forced to use it.""
The man's eyes flashed and the air around them began to vibrate. The hairs on the back of Kari's neck stood up and her skin crawled at the feeling of his gaze.
""It's too late for that,"" the man said, stepping toward Kari with his arms outstretched.
Kari brought her sword up and parried his first blow with ease. She tried to follow it up with another attack but the man ducked under it and swept her leg out from underneath her. She went down hard, landing on her left shoulder and sliding across the floor. Her sword clattered away from her as she tried to get up, but the man was already advancing on her.",1255,0.5188700703963991,0.9351844226087824,0.5909832108179752,0.25869685301763246,0.15203961177507969
302,R_USFk98SjFwNhap3,ALL_HF_9,High Fantasy,All-Nighter,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.
""Are you sure this is where we're supposed to meet them?"" asked Lothar as he and the others dismounted and tied off their horses. ""It looks completely abandoned.""
""I'm not certain,"" said Dorn. He had ridden ahead to scout the area. ""But I did see something moving on the tower roof before we rode here. There might still be someone there.""
Dorn had a good point. Even if there wasn't, they were close enough to the mountains that they could set up an ambush if necessary. They had to assume there were enemies waiting for them somewhere nearby.
""All right, let's get moving then,"" said Lothar. ""We don't have any choice. If we want to save the princess, this is our only chance. Let's go.""
Lothar led the way, followed by his friends and their mounts, toward the tower. As they approached it, a large shape suddenly rose up out of the shadows. Before anyone could react, the creature leaped down from the tower, landing in front of them.
""Who are you and what do you want?"" demanded the creature, its voice deep and gruff.
The group stood frozen, not sure how to respond.
""My name is Lothar,"" said Lothar, slowly approaching the creature. ""And we came to find out what happened to the people in the village. We've been looking all over for them.""
The creature looked at Lothar for several moments, studying him carefully. Then it turned to the others, its face expressionless.
""You know, you're right. I was just about to leave when I saw someone on the tower. So, if you'll follow me, I'll take you to her.""
Dorn, who had been staring at the creature, finally noticed it. He stepped forward to get a better look.
""What is that thing?"" he asked, pointing to the creature's arm. It was covered with a thick coat of black fur and appeared to be growing out of its wrist.
The creature's eyes narrowed slightly as it stared down Dorn. ""That is my arm, human. You see, I am a kobold. The people you seek are not here.""
Dorn frowned at the creature but said nothing more. Instead, he turned back to Lothar.
""It sounds like we can't trust this one,"" he said, motioning to the creature with his head. ""I'm going to go see if there are any other kobolds around.""
Lothar nodded in agreement and watched as Dorn left.
""We should stay together,"" he told the rest of the group. ""Let's make sure no one gets separated.""
The others nodded their assent, and they continued walking toward the village. They soon reached a small house that sat along the side of the valley. The door was open, and from inside they could hear the sound of sobbing.
""That must be her,"" said Lothar, pointing to the house.
""I agree,"" said Dorn, moving up to stand next to Lothar. ""Let's go.""
The group followed Dorn into the house and found themselves in a large kitchen. A young girl, barely older than six, was sitting on a stool by the counter, sobbing uncontrollably. Her father, an old man with a long grey beard, stood at the stove, stirring something in a pot over a fire. The smell of stew wafted through the room.
""Please, stop crying,"" said Dorn as he moved to the girl's side. ""Your mother will be here soon.""
The girl sniffled for several moments before turning to him, her face streaked with tears and snot. She looked up at Dorn, her eyes wide and scared.
""My mother?"" she asked, wiping the tears from her cheeks. ""What do you mean? My mother is gone. She died when I was little.""
Dorn sighed heavily, his heart breaking at the thought of what the child must be feeling. ""I'm sorry to hear that, little one,"" he said as kindly as possible. ""But your mother will be coming home soon. I promise you that.""
The girl sniffled again, her eyes growing wide. ""You're not going to eat my mother, are you?""
Dorn's face turned red as he realized how it sounded. ""No! Of course not,"" he said, quickly adding, ""I meant no harm by it.""
The girl sniffled some more and wiped the tears from her cheeks. ""Then who are you?"" she asked.
Dorn smiled at her. ""That's what I want to ask you.""
The girl looked at Dorn with uncertainty. ""Well, I am a kobold.""
""I see,"" said Dorn. ""And where did you come from?""
""From a village called Ryliss,"" replied the kobold, its voice low and gruff. ""It was attacked by humans. They killed everyone in our village. But then the kobolds came. We fought them off and took their village.""
Dorn's jaw dropped open. ""How many people were there in this village?""
The girl nodded. ""About fifty or sixty.""
Dorn looked over at Lothar. The ranger shrugged his shoulders. He had been wondering the same thing. If the village was that small, it couldn't have taken out so many humans without help from the other kobold clans.
""Where is Ryliss?"" asked Dorn, trying to sound calm.
The kobold shook its head. ""It doesn't matter right now. We need to find your mother, and we can talk about it later.""
Dorn frowned but didn't say anything further. Instead, he turned to the old man stirring the stew. ""What happened here?""
The old man stopped and turned to look at Dorn, a slight smile on his face. ""Nothing,"" he said, shaking his head. ""We've just been waiting for someone to come by so that we could get out of this place.""
""Who are you?"" asked Dorn.
The old man smiled. ""I'm Lothar, and this is my friend Dorn. We're here to help you find your mother.""
""My mother? I don't think she's coming back,"" said the girl, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. ""She left me behind. She's gone.""
Dorn looked over at Lothar again. This wasn't going as planned. He couldn't see how they were ever going to rescue the princess if these kobolds weren't willing to help.",1087,-0.7186124610852076,0.06133537528552064,-0.8401193045171421,-0.24395296221315202,-0.4922579011005468
303,R_1Fs6fPxqCFzqovK,LOW_HR_8,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He didn't even know what she looked like yet—she wore an old brown cloak over her dress that concealed most of her from view. Only as she leaned forward to take a piece of bread did he catch a glimpse of her pale white hands, long-fingered and delicate, with their dark hair curled and gathered up in a bun on the back of her head. It was then that it hit him—this woman who looked so strange was a princess, the daughter of the king. She was sitting right there, right in front of him! What would the people think if they knew he had seen her? What would the other girls say when they learned the boy who tended their horses had been talking with the princess? The thought made him want to run out of the door, but then she spoke to him and everything changed. He couldn't believe how soft her voice was, or how her eyes held such a sadness deep within them. She asked him a question, her voice so quiet he almost missed it.
""Are you new?"" she said.
He nodded and told her so, feeling foolish for not knowing she was a princess. ""You have a fine hand,"" she replied. ""I am looking for someone who can draw.""
His heart thundered inside his chest. ""My name is Benito. I have done some work before."" His mind reeled at the thought that she wanted to hire him, but he kept silent so as not to seem too eager. After all, there were hundreds of artists in London, and most of them drew better than he did.
""Come see me tomorrow,"" she said.
She took another bite of the bread and ate while the others in the room watched her, but she paid no attention to them. When she finished, she left without looking back once. For hours after, he sat motionless in his chair, unable to do anything but stare at the spot where she had last sat. How could he hope to impress her if he didn't even finish drawing what she had asked for? But what choice did he have? In order to get a job, he needed to impress her. That night he stayed awake until morning working on a picture of a ship sailing on the water. It wasn't very good, but it was the best he had ever done, and it brought tears to his eyes as he handed it to the maid who came to clean the inn every morning. The next day he returned to the tavern, and again she was there, waiting for him. And again, she ordered him to bring her his drawings. Over the next few weeks she asked for several different pictures, each more complex than the last.
""You must be quite skilled to do all these things so quickly,"" she said.
Her compliment made him feel warm and excited, but he remained silent. He had learned long ago that speaking to strangers could lead to trouble. Still, her kindness was overwhelming him. ""Thank you,"" he said finally. ""That means a lot to me.""
""It should,"" she said. Her eyes sparkled. ""Do you know why?""
He shook his head.
""Because my father says you are the only person who draws well enough to paint a portrait of me. We are leaving soon on a journey, and I wish to have a portrait of myself before we leave.""
As he stared at her, she stood up and walked away without another word. It took a moment for him to realize she had dismissed him, and it was only then that he realized what was happening. If he wanted to become a painter, he had to please this princess, and now she was offering him a chance to earn money by painting her. He was sure that no one else had ever gotten to paint a princess. All his life he had dreamed about becoming an artist, but now he had found something better than that dream—a way to make his own fortune as an artist, even though he didn't have much of a portfolio to show anyone. All he had to do was follow the princess and learn more about her, so that when he painted her he could make sure the likeness was perfect. Of course, he thought, she has to be beautiful, and he wouldn't dare let her down. As he hurried outside, his heart was pounding and he felt lightheaded, as if a great burden had suddenly lifted from his shoulders. For the first time in his life, he actually felt happy.
When the princess arrived, he met her at the front entrance of the palace, and she looked so beautiful that his knees began to shake and he nearly fell to the ground. She greeted him warmly, but there was an air of excitement about her that made it clear she hadn't expected anyone to be there to greet her. ""Didn't Lord Sartoris tell you I was coming today?"" she asked. ""I have come for your sketches,"" she added. ""Bring them to my chambers.""
With the greatest effort, he managed to stand up straight and walk toward her with his head held high. His eyes were drawn to her long black hair, which seemed to shine like moonlight. Even though he knew that he might never meet any of the royals of England, it still made him proud to be seen with her. He followed her to a large room at the far end of the palace. There were several chairs arranged around a round table that was covered with parchment and various brushes and pots of paint. On the walls, paintings hung on wooden frames. Some of them were portraits, but many of them depicted landscapes or scenes of the city, along with sketches that were clearly works in progress. A fire crackled in a fireplace in one corner of the room, warming him against the cold autumn wind outside.
""This is a wonderful place you have here,"" he said. ""I love looking at the art.""
""And you've been good enough to give me your drawings for consideration as subjects for my portraits,"" she replied. ""Now let's see what you can do with a living subject.""
She pulled off her cloak and laid it across a chair. Then she removed her blue-gray gown and stood before him clad only in her undershirt and a pair of thin cotton pants. The sun shone through the windows and glinted on the jewels that decorated her neckline and sleeves. She turned slowly so that he could look at her from every angle, and he could tell she was proud of the way she looked. Her smile lit up her entire face and sent shivers down his spine. This was going to be harder than he had thought.
""What would you like me to wear?"" she asked.
He hesitated for a moment, wondering if this was the right answer. It was so difficult to think of anything other than how lovely she looked standing before him. Finally, he blurted out, ""Something comfortable, I suppose."" He smiled nervously, hoping she wouldn't be offended.
""Whatever you prefer,"" she said, turning to sit on a chair near the window and pulling her legs up under her skirt until she was resting against the wall. ""I'm used to wearing men's clothes anyway."" She smiled mischievously and glanced down at herself. ""It is not easy being a royal princess. My father has many duties that keep him busy day and night.""",1299,0.5320168280737388,-0.6490841468220435,-1.6125183003070303,-1.041658770410097,0.7533695349764501
304,R_2e8NFvOo0KnS5mu,GEN_HOR_2,Horror,Genesis,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had long black hair with deep blue eyes.
""Hello,"" it said in an eerie voice like only I could hear. There were no words spoken by the person in the mirror. Only a strange voice that seemed to be coming from inside my head. ""My name is Anna.""
""Who are you?"" I asked her.
She smiled and answered, ""We'll get to know each other very well."" She then reached for my hand and held on tightly as she walked around behind me. A moment later, we were standing outside of my house as we watched the sun rise up over the horizon.
It was getting closer to Halloween when my parents decided that they wanted to take us camping one last time before school started again. They rented a big cabin in the mountains so we could have lots of privacy and not worry about people seeing us having sex. We all went out hiking so we could explore the area and enjoy nature while away from home.
""That's a beautiful view,"" my dad said pointing at a couple of trees nearby. He turned his head and looked at me. He always did that whenever he saw me staring off into space or daydreaming. I used to think it was cute how much he loved me but now I just find it annoying.
As we continued walking, we came across a lake hidden in the middle of the woods. It was surrounded by green grass and tall pines. All of a sudden, we heard screaming. When we looked back, the screams stopped. Then we saw someone running through the forest with their clothes torn apart.
""What is going on here?"" my mom cried out. We all stood there stunned by what we had just seen. As the man ran past us, we noticed that he was naked and bleeding. His arms and legs were ripped wide open. He kept falling down and stumbling as if he couldn't find any strength.
Then, as quick as it started, the man fell to the ground and died right in front of our eyes. Everyone stared at him and let out an audible gasp. My dad immediately dropped to his knees and began crying. The rest of us followed suit and we all started weeping loudly.
The man laid there motionless on the ground and he didn't move again. We all stayed there for a few minutes but soon realized that there was nothing we could do for him. We left him lying there in silence and returned to camp to pack up so we could leave early.
My parents walked over to where the body was laying. They knelt down beside him and put their hands over his bloody face. Then they kissed his forehead and whispered something to him. I couldn't hear them over the noise so I looked back at the others. I could see the fear in their eyes and I knew they were thinking the same thing I was; this was some sort of sick ritual.
After that, my parents packed up everything quickly and drove us home. When we arrived, we unpacked and cleaned up before doing anything else. It took a lot longer than usual because everyone was feeling depressed about what had happened. After dinner, my parents decided that we would all spend the night together in the cabin. I wasn't sure if this was a good idea, but they insisted so I agreed.
Once we finished eating, my brother and sister went out and played cards while my parents sat down on the couch. I sat across from them next to my mom as she started rubbing my back.
""I'm sorry,"" she said looking at me.
""For what?"" I asked.
""That man,"" she said. ""He was your father's best friend.""
I nodded my head and said, ""No matter who he was, he is still dead. Let's not talk about him anymore.""
My mom rubbed my back some more and tried to calm herself down. She didn't say another word until my dad cleared his throat.
""Are you okay?"" he asked.
She nodded her head and replied, ""Yes, thank you.""
My dad put his arm around her shoulder and said, ""Don't apologize. This has been very hard for all of us. You've done a fine job holding everything together.""
My mom smiled and thanked him for the compliment.
""You're very welcome,"" he said patting my mother's shoulder.
Then he looked back over at me and asked, ""How was your hike today?""
I shrugged my shoulders and responded, ""It was fun.""
My dad laughed and said, ""What? You weren't afraid to go out alone like that?""
I shook my head and said, ""Oh, no. I wasn't scared at all. Actually, it was kind of nice being away from the city and all the chaos. It made me feel better to be surrounded by nature once again.""
Everyone else joined in on the laughter and they all started talking about what they did during the day. Soon, my mom got up and went into the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator door and pulled out a gallon of milk. When she closed it, there was a loud thud. I jumped up and ran into the kitchen to see what happened.
""What was that?"" I asked her.
""Oh, that's just the door slamming shut,"" she replied. ""Sorry about that.""
Then she took the pitcher of milk out of the fridge and poured it all over the floor. She did the same thing with the butter. When she finished, she threw the empty containers at me and screamed, ""Now clean this mess up!""
I wiped my hands off on my jeans and went to grab some paper towels. Once I had some, I walked into the living room and handed them to her.
""Thanks,"" she said taking them.
She then wiped her hands off and turned towards me, ""I don't care if you went hiking or whatever. Just make sure that you stay close to us when we're out here. Understand?""
I nodded my head and said, ""Sure.""
She smiled at me and said, ""Good.""
Once everyone finished cleaning up, we all went to our rooms to get ready for bed. When I lay down, I felt something cold against my leg. It was the zipper of my sleeping bag. I looked down and noticed that my brother was trying to crawl inside. When I moved toward him, he yelled, ""Get away from me!""
I sat up and hugged him tight. ""Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you. Why don't you tell me what's wrong? I promise I won't judge you.""
He sniffled and said, ""I can't sleep because you keep kicking me.""
I kicked him back and said, ""I was trying to kick off the covers. What's the problem?""",1190,-1.1551641944100253,-1.5099439462309625,0.9440824904338961,-0.0431178868457223,-1.1377302904830608
305,R_3flSnsZuUzNFWYW,FAN_HSF_5,Hard Sci-Fi,Fandango,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The president wasn't due to be back until Monday; however, I knew that his secretary would be there and waiting for us today.
The office building was an hour's walk away. The walk gave me time to think about what had happened last night, but as always, I tried not to let myself go too deep into thought. My head couldn't handle the constant barrage of my own thoughts like it could when I was on Earth. It made me tired and depressed, so I tried to focus on the sights around me instead.
A red giant star shone in the sky, casting its light across Mars' northern hemisphere. I stared up at it as I walked past the skyscraper complexes that had been built in the northern cities when Mars was still habitable. Then more skyscrapers came into view as I approached the center of town. The buildings were made of glass, metal, stone, and brick, all of different colors and materials. They formed an intricate maze of structures surrounding a central plaza.
I turned towards the square, walking down one of the smaller roads that branched off from the main street. I passed several groups of people as I went. None of them were wearing protective suits, which indicated that they were from Mars' original settlers, or maybe one of its more recent colonies. There were plenty of signs of human life scattered throughout the city, despite it being a ruin now—there were a lot of ruins here on Mars.
Most of the buildings in the square were made of dark stone and had no glass windows on their facades, only some small holes where the glass used to be. The only thing that broke up the monotony of the square was the occasional sign or sculpture that dotted the ground. Some of them showed what looked like people—some male, some female. Most were dressed in clothes that looked like they'd come straight out of a history book from Earth, but some of them had clothing that I hadn't seen before.
I stopped when I reached the plaza in front of the white marble building that housed the Mars City Council office. A few members stood outside smoking cigarettes. I recognized the ones who were smoking as being from the mining team.
""Good morning, Alex,"" called one of the men. He was tall and thin, with black hair and dark eyes.
""Good morning, Kevin,"" I replied. ""What's the verdict?""
""Not yet, but we're hoping to get approval to start testing the new machines within the next two days."" His tone turned serious. ""There's also talk that they want the miners put back to work.""
""I'll tell the president then,"" I said. ""I'm sure he won't mind.""
Kevin smiled at me. ""You know him well, don't you?""
""Only by reputation,"" I said. ""I've only met the man once, but he seemed okay.""
""I wouldn't recommend getting too friendly with him though,"" he added. ""He has a reputation of being extremely controlling, even for a politician. You might find yourself caught up in his machinations if you get close to him.""
""No problem,"" I replied. ""I'm just here to give him the message anyway.""
I walked inside the building, heading up a set of stairs that led to the second floor. The offices were laid out in a similar fashion to the ones on Earth, with long, rectangular desks taking up a large portion of the space. I walked past the first four desk, trying to keep my footsteps quiet so that none of the secretaries noticed that I was there. After going two or three sets of desks, I found the president's office.
I opened the door and stepped inside. It was a nice looking office; the floors were made of dark wood, while the walls were painted with bright green stripes. The president himself sat behind his desk, talking on the phone. He was tall and broad with short grey hair. As soon as I saw him, I could see why his nickname was ""The Bull"". His face was scarred up, with a nasty looking burn scar running from his right eyebrow to his chin.
His secretary stood beside the president's chair. She was a young, dark haired woman with a slight build. I wondered how many women had fallen victim to him during his time in office.
""Good afternoon, Mr. President,"" I said.
""Ah, hello, Mr. Smith,"" said the president. ""I thought that I told you to call me John.""
I didn't respond, and instead walked over to the chair opposite his. John waved off the woman standing next to his desk and she walked away, presumably to get us drinks.
""So, is it true, Alex?"" asked John. ""Do you have a message for me from the president?""
""Yes, I do,"" I said. ""He wants to meet with us at his office this afternoon so that we can discuss our new proposals.""
""That's good news,"" said John. ""He must have approved them. I'll look forward to seeing what you two are working on.""
""I'll let you know when I leave,"" I told him, standing up.
""No, wait a moment,"" said John. ""Don't go yet. Sit back down.""
I turned to look at him. ""Why?""
John held up his hand, stopping me. ""Just sit back down, Alex.""
I nodded and sat back down, wondering what the old man had planned. When he was sure that I wasn't going anywhere, he lowered his phone and picked up a file folder from his desk. ""You've been through a lot recently,"" he started. ""I'm glad that you were able to reach the surface without any problems. However, I know that being on Mars hasn't been all easy either.""
His voice was soft as he spoke, but something about it felt wrong. I wasn't quite sure why, but I felt as if I shouldn't trust him.
""I believe that I know what happened to you back there,"" continued the president. ""I've known about you, Alex, since the day that you arrived on Mars. I've always wanted to meet you, but I've kept away for a very specific reason. I've watched you ever since you left my base. I've seen how you've grown, both physically and emotionally. I've seen you become what you are now. I knew that you'd be perfect for what I need you to do. I knew that you'd never accept the fate that was planned for you back then.""
I remained silent, unsure of what he was saying.
""But there was someone else who didn't want you to be the one to survive,"" said John. ""Someone who wanted things to end a certain way.""
""Are you talking about the aliens?"" I asked. ""Do you think that they were the cause of everything?""
John shook his head. ""They don't have anything to do with any of this, Alex. There's a more dangerous force at play than any alien race. And it has been in charge of your story since before you've even been born.""",1236,-0.4192562973377853,-0.25629792188246603,-0.9603542168556527,1.1732444429321114,0.40478161648829514

She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her hair had been dark then—now it's a bright gold that looks as if it has flames inside of it when she moves. It makes my heart ache to look at her sometimes. And those eyes...they're a beautiful shade of green. I've never seen anything like them before or since. They make me want to do things I shouldn't even think about doing with her.
She doesn't know who I am, but everyone else does. That's because they all talk about me behind my back. The men whisper how lucky I am, while the women say I'm a fool for putting up with such treatment. But what can I do? If I don't have any money, no woman will ever marry me. No matter how much I love her.
I've known for quite some time now that she is going to leave me someday soon. I just hope she finds someone better than I am so that I won't feel too bad about losing her. I would give anything to be able to tell her exactly what I'm thinking right now.
But I can't.
""It's not fair!""
Kaitlyn stomped her foot on the ground. ""No more! I'll go find someone else to teach.""
""You should stay here,"" Lark said. He didn't want her to go away either. His father had told him to keep an eye out for her. Lark didn't mind. In fact, he thought she might be fun to play around with. Maybe she wouldn't notice him watching her every day. Then again, maybe she would.
He knew he wasn't supposed to have feelings for anyone yet. There were too many things he still needed to learn. He couldn't afford to get distracted by girls. So instead, he kept his distance from Kaitlyn. As far as he could remember, this was the first girl he had ever met. Even though she hadn't noticed him, he found himself staring at her whenever he could. He wondered if she felt the same way.
""Why?"" she asked. ""Are you going somewhere?""
Lark looked over at her. Her eyes widened slightly as she took in his expression. When she realized he was looking at her, she blushed and looked down at the floor. She stood quickly. ""If I'm not there tomorrow morning, send someone to check on me,"" she said.
Then she turned and walked toward the door. She stopped halfway there and glanced back at him once more before disappearing outside. Lark watched after her until she disappeared into the darkness.
When he went back inside, he headed straight for the kitchen. His mother had already prepared dinner, so he grabbed a piece of bread and ate it slowly. He didn't have very much appetite lately. Whenever he tried to eat something, he ended up throwing it all up afterward. He wished he could explain why to his parents, but he couldn't bring himself to do so. After all, he wasn't sure what was wrong with him. He only knew that whatever it was made him miserable.
His mother came into the room carrying a plate of food and sat next to him. ""How are you feeling today?"" she asked.
""Fine.""
""Did you hear about the fire last night?"" she asked.
""Yes, I heard.""
""A few people lost their homes, including a man who works here at the tavern.""
""Oh?""
""He used to live upstairs above the bar. Now he doesn't have anywhere to live.""
""What happened to his home?""
""It burned down.""
""Is he okay?"" Lark asked.
His mother smiled. ""Don't worry about him. He knows we'll help him out. We always do.""
""Really? How did it happen?""
""Someone set fire to it. You know, there have been a lot of fires lately.""
""Who started them?"" Lark asked.
""That's what they say,"" she replied.
""Do you think someone's trying to hurt us?""
""We're fine, son. Don't you worry about us,"" she said. She put her hand on top of his head. ""Everything will work itself out in the end. You just need to trust in the gods. Everything happens for a reason.""
Lark nodded. He knew his mother meant well. Still, he couldn't shake the fear that someone would try to hurt them. He wanted to believe everything would turn out fine, but he couldn't forget how angry his father had seemed earlier that day.
The sound of footsteps coming down the stairs drew Lark's attention away from his thoughts. He looked over to see a young man enter the room. At first glance, he appeared to be around fifteen years old, but Lark suspected he was actually older.
""There you are,"" the boy said. ""I haven't seen you for weeks.""
""I've just been busy,"" Lark answered.
""You need to pay more attention to your studies,"" the boy said. ""They're important, especially if you want to become an apprentice one day.""
""I know."" Lark sighed. ""My father keeps telling me that.""
The boy rolled his eyes. ""Your father doesn't know what he's talking about. All he cares about is making money. What good is having money if you don't have any time to spend with your family?""
""I understand what he means,"" Lark said. ""But we can't make any money without customers coming in.""
""So why aren't you spending time with them?"" the boy asked.
Lark shook his head. ""I can't. I'm helping my father run the tavern. Besides, if I didn't help him out, he'd probably quit. Then where would we be? We'd lose our place to stay.""
""I don't know about that,"" the boy replied. ""You seem like a smart kid. Why don't you take over the business when your father retires? It would give you plenty of time to study while earning enough money to support yourself. And then you wouldn't have to worry about running the place.""
Lark shrugged. ""Maybe someday. For now, I have to do what I can to help him out.""
""Well, I have to go. I have to help out my father,"" the boy said. ""Good luck to you. I hope you find what you're looking for. And remember what I said. Money isn't everything. It's not worth sacrificing your own happiness for it. Trust me.",1070,-0.18259968976471372,1.123730829161218,0.9447166428725087,0.8382545861329873,0.9009405772192142
307,R_2CwCCaHrGZMT3D5,MOR_HSF_4,Hard Sci-Fi,Morpho,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet.
I was going to be working at a computer all day, but I had a feeling that this afternoon was going to be different.
I went down to the lobby and caught a taxi to take me to the presidential office building. I got out of the cab, crossed the street, and entered the building through the front door and security check. Once I'd cleared security, I went to the elevator and rode it down to the administrative level. Then I walked down the hall toward the president's office.
When I got there, I knocked on the door. ""Come in,"" said President Koshō as he opened the door for me. He was dressed in a smart suit, with a blue tie that matched his suit perfectly. He was well-dressed and very polite to me as he ushered me into the room.
The room was huge, with a large desk in front of it and several chairs in front of it as well. The room itself had a soft blue carpet with a white wall behind it, and a big window with a view of Mars outside at the far end of the room.
President Koshō sat down behind his desk, and I took a seat in one of the chairs in front of it.
""As you know, we've recently sent an unmanned probe into space,"" said President Koshō. ""It was sent to fly around the edge of the solar system and take photos of all the worlds in it.""
""Yes, sir,"" I said. ""I was part of that team.""
""That's good to hear,"" he said. Then he leaned forward and continued speaking to me. ""This probe has been sitting around for about two hours now, and there's still no sign of any life on any of those other planets. That's not good news for us.""
""Not good news?"" I asked him. ""Why not?""
""We've been working really hard to become an interstellar civilization,"" said President Koshō. ""We've been sending out manned missions for years now, and we've also been sending out probes to take photos of some of those other planets in our solar system.""
""Why send a probe?"" I asked him. ""What's wrong with sending a manned mission? Why not send one of our astronauts?""
""There are three reasons for that,"" said President Koshō. ""First of all, sending a manned mission is very expensive. It costs millions of dollars per person to send them out there.""
""I can see that,"" I said.
""Secondly,"" said President Koshō, ""if something goes wrong, you can't just send another crew out there without having to wait another few years to send them out again.""
""I see what you mean,"" I said.
""And finally,"" he continued, ""if something really bad happens, like an explosion or a fire or something like that, you can't just send another crew out there at once without having to go through so many safety checks.""
""I think I understand,"" I said.
""So why don't we send a probe instead?"" asked President Koshō. ""We can send unmanned probes out into space every few months, which means we can keep an eye on things out there without having to send any more people out there.""
""Yes, sir,"" I said. ""That makes sense.""
""That's what we've been doing,"" said President Koshō, ""and that's why we sent our unmanned probe out today."" Then he leaned forward and continued talking to me. ""We sent this probe out into space so that we can take pictures of all those other planets in our solar system."" Then he paused and looked at me before continuing on with his thoughts. ""We're hoping that there might be life on one of those other planets.""
""Why would there be?"" I asked him.
""Well,"" said President Koshō, ""we just sent our probe out today, so it may take some time before we can get pictures of all those other planets, but if there is life on any of those other planets, then we'll know about it soon enough."" Then he sat back in his chair and waited for my response before continuing on with what he had to say next. ""We really need you to help us find out if there's life on any of those other planets.""
""What do you expect me to do?"" I asked him.
""Well,"" said President Koshō, ""we want you to find out if there's life on one of those other planets.""
""How is that possible?"" I asked him. ""I'm not a scientist.""
""That's not true,"" said President Koshō. ""You're one of our best scientists here on Mars. You're very good at what you do."" Then he paused for a moment before continuing on with what he had to say next. ""You've already been part of the team that took photos of most of those other planets in our solar system.""
""Yes, sir,"" I said, ""I have been.""
""So why don't you use your skills to help us find out if there's life on any of those other planets?"" asked President Koshō. ""The president has asked me if you would help us find out if there's life on any of those other planets in our solar system."" Then he leaned forward and looked at me before continuing on with what he had to say next. ""He's told me that you're one of our best scientists here on Mars, and that you're very good at what you do."" Then he sat back again and waited for my response before continuing on with what he had to say next. ""He's told me that you know what you're doing, and that you're good at what you do.""
After a few seconds, I responded by saying, ""Yes, sir...I do know what I'm doing...and...I'm good at what I do...""
After several seconds, President Koshō responded by saying, ""Excellent! That's exactly what we need from you!"" Then he leaned forward again and continued talking to me before nodding his head once more before speaking again. ""I want you to find out if there's life on any of those other planets in our solar system."" Then he looked at me again before continuing on with what he had to say next. ""You can do this by taking pictures of some of those other planets with your camera,"" he said, ""and comparing them against the pictures taken by our unmanned probe sitting around out there in space right now."" Then he paused for a moment before continuing on with what he had to say next with his head still nodding once more as he looked at me. ""Just make sure you take lots of pictures so we can compare them properly against each other."" Then he sat back again and waited for my response before continuing on with his thoughts. ""We need you to find out if there is life on any of those other planets in our solar system...before we send another manned mission out there again."" Then he leaned forward again as if waiting for a response from me before continuing on with what he had to say next as his head still remained leaning forward again while waiting for my response before continuing on with what he had to say next...but nothing came from my mouth again...
""...and...I'm good at what I do..."" I repeated once more as I stood up from my chair...and walked towards the door...before turning around as I reached it...",1296,0.9093067226963627,1.0765197735601102,-0.6949828306377758,-1.9531422057047425,1.0822153978626272
308,R_2yrC3kIQBpa8KAP,BAS_HOR_4,Horror,Basic Coherence,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my own reflection; it had black eyes and red lips like something out of an old horror movie. The figure reached through the mirror and grabbed me by the neck. My body went limp as its cold hands squeezed tightly around my throat. A sharp pain shot through my chest as I gasped for air.
""You're mine now,"" said the figure in my reflection. ""You belong to me.""
The figure pulled me closer and began kissing my neck. Its tongue licked across my skin before sinking inside of me. I felt myself getting wetter with every passing second.
I opened my mouth wide so that it could have more access to my throat. As soon as I did, the figure's head pushed down and entered my mouth. It was warm and moist, but not too much. Just enough to make me feel good.
It started thrusting its hips against mine. Each time it did, it made my body shake and shiver. It kept going even after I came. Then suddenly, it stopped.
""What are you doing?"" I asked. ""Why aren't you making me cum anymore? You promised!""
""Oh no, sweetheart,"" the figure said. ""That's not what this is about.""
The figure stood up and turned around. It then took off all of its clothes except for one item—a mask. It put on the mask and picked me up by the waist. It carried me over to the bed and laid me down. The figure climbed onto the bed and straddled my stomach. It lowered itself down until it was sitting between my legs.
""Now, we can do whatever we want together,"" said the figure. ""We'll be partners forever.""
As it spoke, the figure placed its hand on top of my thigh. It slowly moved upwards until it reached my pussy. The figure spread my lips apart and began rubbing its fingers against my clit.
""This is how I'm gonna take care of you,"" said the figure. ""Every night. Every day. Forever.""
I moaned loudly as the figure continued playing with my pussy. It rubbed my clit and inserted two of its fingers inside of me. I closed my eyes tight as the pleasure grew stronger and stronger. My breathing became heavier and heavier until I couldn't breathe at all.
""Please... don't stop..."" I whispered.
The figure didn't listen. Instead, it shoved its fingers deeper inside of me. I screamed out in pain as my body tensed up. Then the figure removed its fingers from my pussy. It replaced them with its cock. It positioned the tip right above my pussy and pushed forward. I let out another scream as the figure penetrated me.
""Ahhh! Nooo! Please... please don't hurt me!""
The figure ignored my pleas and began fucking me hard. I cried out louder than ever before. My cries echoed throughout the room until they were drowned out by the sound of the bed crashing against the wall.
The figure fucked me harder and faster until I finally climaxed. I screamed out loud as waves of pleasure coursed through my entire body. The figure kept pounding away at me until it came too. It collapsed on top of me, panting heavily.
""That was amazing,"" said the figure. ""Let's do it again sometime.""
The figure lifted itself off of me and sat next to the bed. I lay there motionless, unable to move or speak. After a few moments, the figure leaned over and kissed me on the forehead.
""Goodnight, sweetheart,"" it said. ""Sweet dreams.""
Then it left the room. I waited for the door to close before I rolled over and tried to get some sleep. But I couldn't fall asleep. All I could think about was that figure. What had happened to me? Why was I being taken advantage of like this?
I thought about calling the police, but I knew that wouldn't help. They'd just tell me that I must have been dreaming. There was nothing I could do. So instead, I decided to try and forget about it. I would pretend that none of it had ever happened.
But that was easier said than done. I couldn't stop thinking about that figure. I wondered if it was real. If it was, where was it now? Did it go home and fuck its wife and kids while I was still lying here in bed?
I tossed and turned all night long. Eventually, I fell into a deep sleep. When I awoke, the figure was standing over me once again. It stared down at me with those red lips and black eyes.
""Hello, sweetheart,"" said the figure. ""How are you feeling today?""
""I'm okay,"" I replied.
""Are you sure you're alright?"" asked the figure. ""Do you need anything? Would you like to talk about last night?""
""No,"" I said. ""I'm fine.""
The figure smiled and nodded. Then it stepped closer and kissed me on the cheek.
""Thank you for letting me stay with you,"" said the figure. ""I promise I won't cause any trouble.""
""Okay,"" I replied. ""I'm glad you're staying with me.""
The figure smiled and gave me a hug. I wrapped my arms around it and held it tight. I felt safe in its embrace.
""Don't worry,"" said the figure. ""I'll always be there for you. I'll never leave your side.""
I hugged the figure tighter and buried my face into its chest. I didn't know why, but I felt safer when it was hugging me like that.
""I love you,"" I whispered. ""Please don't ever leave me alone.""
""I won't,"" said the figure. ""Never again.""
The figure left the room and closed the door behind it. I got out of bed and went downstairs. I fixed myself some breakfast and ate it in the living room. Then I cleaned up the dishes and went upstairs to take a shower. I washed my hair and brushed my teeth. Then I put on a fresh set of clothes.
When I finished dressing, I went outside and sat down on the porch. I watched the sun rise over the horizon. It was beautiful. The sky was filled with bright colors and fluffy clouds. Birds chirped and fluttered their wings as they flew overhead.
I sat there for hours, watching the sunrise. I felt calm and peaceful. I was happy. I was finally free of that horrible figure.",1109,0.6080252804753322,1.827050585952801,1.0099415894980897,-0.043278272149405383,0.8144420900939714
309,R_bIq83voUdcd3Ndv,ACE_HR_4,Historical Romance,Ace of Spade,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been so caught up with the new baby that had arrived on his doorstep just days before—a little girl named Anna who seemed to be sleeping as much as she cried—that he hadn't even noticed her until he glanced up from cleaning the counter and spotted her. His breath had stopped for a moment when he realized what it was about her that took his breath away. It wasn't anything about her outward appearance. She wore simple clothing, but it fit her well. Her hair was long and brown and tied back in a single braid down her back. And yet…there was something else about her that made him pause. Something that sent a chill through him every time he looked at her.
He'd felt it then; he knew he did now. This woman was different. She had no family, not here in town or anywhere nearby. No friends. Not even a husband or lover. A man could see this by looking at her, by studying how she moved, by watching the way she carried herself. But there were other ways too. The way she held her head, the way she looked over her shoulder toward the door whenever someone walked past her, the way her eyes followed anyone who came close to her.
She was alone. And he knew he wanted her all to himself.
So far, he'd managed to keep his distance, to avoid being seen by her again, and thus avoid any chance encounter that would give her reason to suspect the feelings he had for her. But today was different. Today she sat at another table in front of him. Alone, as always, and as beautiful as ever. She'd ordered only a cup of tea, which meant that he'd have to wait a while longer to serve her, because he didn't think she needed food right now. Maybe never again if he kept serving her tea.
But that wouldn't work either. If he gave her tea every day, she might start expecting more than just tea. Sooner or later, she might expect him to go upstairs with her and do things that couldn't happen. That's why he tried to keep her at arm's length. But sometimes that was easier said than done. Like when he served her the first cup of tea. Or when she smiled at him. Or when she looked at him and he saw those dark brown eyes staring directly into his soul.
And now he had to deal with this situation again. Forcing himself to concentrate on the tasks ahead of him, he began washing mugs. As usual, he thought about taking her upstairs after he finished serving her, but he pushed aside thoughts of sex, focusing instead on the task at hand. When he finally stood next to her table, he poured out two cups of hot water and handed one to her. ""Here you are.""
""Thank you,"" she replied. Then, without waiting for him to move away, she lifted the mug to her lips and took a sip.
That's it, he told himself. Don't let yourself get distracted. Don't look at her. Keep your eyes on the job at hand. But somehow, it was impossible to resist. He watched her take another sip. Then another. He watched as she set the mug down on the table, then picked up a small piece of bread. He watched her eat it. Slowly, methodically, almost as though she didn't really want the bread. Almost as though she were doing it because she had to, rather than because she wanted to.
What is wrong with me? He asked himself. I shouldn't be thinking about this. What am I going to say to her tomorrow morning? What will I tell her? That I've fallen in love with her? That I don't know how I feel about her, but I can't stop myself from wanting to be near her? Will she believe me?
Or maybe she already knows. Maybe she feels the same way. After all, they're both alone.
His heart started pounding loudly in his chest. How could she not feel the same way? He had no idea what to say, no clue whether she'd respond in kind. All he knew was that he wanted to find out. He wanted to ask her if she felt the same way. He wanted to hear her say yes. He wanted to hear her say yes so badly that his throat went dry and he swallowed hard several times to moisten it. Finally, he found the words. ""May I join you?"" he asked quietly.
Her mouth dropped open, and she stared at him in shock. Then, slowly, she closed it. She nodded once.
He moved around the table and slid into the empty chair beside her. ""I hope you don't mind my asking,"" he began, ""but…do you speak English?""
""No,"" she replied, shaking her head. ""You?""
""Yes. I'm sorry, I didn't realize you didn't understand English.""
""Oh. You mean…you don't know what I'm saying?""
""Of course not! I apologize for assuming."" He paused. ""How about German? Do you speak that?""
""I'm afraid not. Only a few words here and there. Mostly I use sign language, but—""
He interrupted her. ""Then how about this: Can I buy you lunch tomorrow?""
She hesitated, then nodded again. ""If you wish. Yes, please. Lunch tomorrow would be nice.""
He grinned at her. ""Good. Now, since we'll be eating together, I need to know what you'd like to order. Are you hungry now, or should we wait until later?""
""Now would be fine. Thank you for offering.""
He left her then, walking back across the room to refill the pitcher of tea. Once he was sure that she was busy drinking her second cup of tea, he made his way toward the kitchen. He wasn't surprised to see that she'd placed an order for a bowl of soup.
It was strange, he thought. She eats so little, yet she's so skinny. And yet, she seems to eat very little, and yet she still gets skinnier. He frowned. Did she ever eat anything at all?
He'd been wondering about this ever since he'd first met her, but he hadn't had time to wonder about it during the past week, when he'd had other, more important things to worry about. The baby was a handful, but he loved her dearly. And Anna seemed happy too. She smiled a lot now, especially when he played with her in the evenings. She was a good sleeper, too. She usually slept through the night, and she napped well throughout the day.
But now he had a chance to think about it again. And he wondered about it more deeply this time.
He returned to the bar area and waited patiently.",1169,-1.1226095648062373,-0.12815747663480034,-0.8702950406011173,0.023463041807705143,-1.8592070555151006

She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. Her hair had been dark then—now it's a bright gold that looks as if it has flames inside of it when she moves. It makes my heart ache to look at her sometimes. And those eyes...they're a beautiful shade of green. I've never seen anything like them before or since. They make me want to do things I shouldn't even think about doing with her.
She doesn't know who I am, but everyone else does. That's because they all talk about me behind my back. The men whisper how lucky I am, while the women say I'm a fool for putting up with such treatment. But what can I do? If I don't have any money, no woman will ever marry me. No matter how much I love her.
I've known for quite some time now that she is going to leave me someday soon. I just hope she finds someone better than I am so that I won't feel too bad about losing her. I would give anything to be able to tell her exactly what I'm thinking right now.
But I can't.
""It's not fair!""
Kaitlyn stomped her foot on the ground. ""No more! I'll go find someone else to teach.""
""You should stay here,"" Lark said. He didn't want her to go away either. His father had told him to keep an eye out for her. Lark didn't mind. In fact, he thought she might be fun to play around with. Maybe she wouldn't notice him watching her every day. Then again, maybe she would.
He knew he wasn't supposed to have feelings for anyone yet. There were too many things he still needed to learn. He couldn't afford to get distracted by girls. So instead, he kept his distance from Kaitlyn. As far as he could remember, this was the first girl he had ever met. Even though she hadn't noticed him, he found himself staring at her whenever he could. He wondered if she felt the same way.
""Why?"" she asked. ""Are you going somewhere?""
Lark looked over at her. Her eyes widened slightly as she took in his expression. When she realized he was looking at her, she blushed and looked down at the floor. She stood quickly. ""If I'm not there tomorrow morning, send someone to check on me,"" she said.
Then she turned and walked toward the door. She stopped halfway there and glanced back at him once more before disappearing outside. Lark watched after her until she disappeared into the darkness.
When he went back inside, he headed straight for the kitchen. His mother had already prepared dinner, so he grabbed a piece of bread and ate it slowly. He didn't have very much appetite lately. Whenever he tried to eat something, he ended up throwing it all up afterward. He wished he could explain why to his parents, but he couldn't bring himself to do so. After all, he wasn't sure what was wrong with him. He only knew that whatever it was made him miserable.
His mother came into the room carrying a plate of food and sat next to him. ""How are you feeling today?"" she asked.
""Fine.""
""Did you hear about the fire last night?"" she asked.
""Yes, I heard.""
""A few people lost their homes, including a man who works here at the tavern.""
""Oh?""
""He used to live upstairs above the bar. Now he doesn't have anywhere to live.""
""What happened to his home?""
""It burned down.""
""Is he okay?"" Lark asked.
His mother smiled. ""Don't worry about him. He knows we'll help him out. We always do.""
""Really? How did it happen?""
""Someone set fire to it. You know, there have been a lot of fires lately.""
""Who started them?"" Lark asked.
""That's what they say,"" she replied.
""Do you think someone's trying to hurt us?""
""We're fine, son. Don't you worry about us,"" she said. She put her hand on top of his head. ""Everything will work itself out in the end. You just need to trust in the gods. Everything happens for a reason.""
Lark nodded. He knew his mother meant well. Still, he couldn't shake the fear that someone would try to hurt them. He wanted to believe everything would turn out fine, but he couldn't forget how angry his father had seemed earlier that day.
The sound of footsteps coming down the stairs drew Lark's attention away from his thoughts. He looked over to see a young man enter the room. At first glance, he appeared to be around fifteen years old, but Lark suspected he was actually older.
""There you are,"" the boy said. ""I haven't seen you for weeks.""

""You need to pay more attention to your studies,"" the boy said. ""They're important, especially if you want to become an apprentice one day.""
""I know."" Lark sighed. ""My father keeps telling me that.""
The boy rolled his eyes. ""Your father doesn't know what he's talking about. All he cares about is making money. What good is having money if you don't have any time to spend with your family?""
""I understand what he means,"" Lark said. ""But we can't make any money without customers coming in.""
""So why aren't you spending time with them?"" the boy asked.
Lark shook his head. ""I can't. I'm helping my father run the tavern. Besides, if I didn't help him out, he'd probably quit. Then where would we be? We'd lose our place to stay.""
""I don't know about that,"" the boy replied. ""You seem like a smart kid. Why don't you take over the business when your father retires? It would give you plenty of time to study while earning enough money to support yourself. And then you wouldn't have to worry about running the place.""
Lark shrugged. ""Maybe someday. For now, I have to do what I can to help him out.""
""Well, I have to go. I have to help out my father,"" the boy said. ""Good luck to you. I hope you find what you're looking for. And remember what I said. Money isn't everything.

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. At least it would last me through the night, but as I hurried through the city streets, I wondered how much longer I'd be able to keep waking up at four o'clock in the morning without feeling like I was going crazy or dying.
My walk down the long hallways toward the president's inner office was uneventful, and I got there just after 1 PM. As always, his assistant, Ms. Hsu, greeted me at the door when I arrived and led me into a small conference room where President Sato awaited. He had been working late the previous evening, so I knew he wanted to speak with me in private, which was why I'd asked Ms. Hsu to let him know I was coming.
When he opened the door and saw me, he stood up from behind his desk and smiled. ""Good afternoon, Mr. Smith,"" he said, extending his hand.
""Mr. President,"" I replied, clasping it firmly before letting go. We then sat down in front of his desk and he placed his own envelope on top of a stack of papers on his table. ""Did you sleep well?"" he asked me.
""Very well, thank you,"" I answered. ""Your letter was unexpected, but I've read it three times now.""
""And what did it tell you?"" he asked.
I hesitated. ""I don't think I should say,"" I told him. ""It contains sensitive information about our current situation.""
He frowned. ""Please forgive my lack of faith, Mr. Smith. I know you are well aware of all the events taking place at this very moment, and I am certain you will understand how important it is for us to share this information with each other.""
""You're right, sir,"" I said. ""But I have a promise to keep.""
""Then perhaps I can make this easier for you,"" he suggested. ""You have the option of reading the entire letter, or simply listening to me summarize its contents. Which do you prefer?""
I thought about the question a moment. ""How much time will it take me to listen to what you have to say?""
""Not long at all,"" he assured me. ""Perhaps five or ten minutes.""
""In that case,"" I answered, ""the letter will help me remember some of the details. If I read it myself, I won't pay as much attention.""
""Very well,"" he conceded. ""I'll begin.""
After he finished reading the entire message, he explained to me everything he had learned. I then listened to his summary, and after each paragraph, I wrote a brief notation in my notebook. Finally, when the interview was over, I thanked him and walked out of his office.
The walk back to my apartment was long, and I had to stop for a moment once I reached its doors to collect my thoughts. In many ways, the letter was disturbing, but I found myself more shocked by what I'd learned of our president's personal life than anything else. Not to mention the fact that his words were laced with enough hints as to who was involved in these events to leave no doubt in my mind.
As soon as I stepped inside my apartment, however, my mind began working overtime, and by the time I laid down for a nap, the letter and its contents were still fresh in my mind. The only thing that prevented me from falling immediately asleep was the thought that I needed to check the weather report before heading out again. So instead, I climbed out of bed and began preparing for another long, late-night walk into town.
It wasn't easy, and the heat was intense, but I managed to get to the weather station before the sunset. I was hoping to find some answers regarding what had happened at our research facility, but when I entered the building, there was nobody around. I tried my best to remain calm, and to think logically, but when I saw the blood spatter on the wall near the entrance, and when I realized the security guard's body was lying next to it, I couldn't help myself.
I ran outside and began screaming. I didn't even know what to say or why I was shouting, but I knew I had to make noise, so I continued screaming as if it would help me somehow. Then, after several moments of hysterics, I finally calmed down and looked around me. To my surprise, all the other people in the area had also noticed what was happening and were rushing toward me.
I could only imagine how terrified they must have felt. After all, no one in their right mind gets excited when they see someone scream. But the truth was, nobody in the crowd seemed too surprised to see me running around in the desert with tears flowing down my cheeks. They simply stared at me until I stopped crying and then walked away. I didn't care, though. I was relieved when I saw the police arrive and began questioning me.
I'm not sure how many questions were asked, but I remember being asked them all. When I didn't answer quickly enough or with the proper words, I was accused of using drugs or something similar. And although I was eventually freed and allowed to return home, they did take samples from me, and I was informed that I wouldn't be allowed to enter any restricted areas for two weeks. Fortunately, I'd made it home when all of this happened. Otherwise, I'm sure the police would have detained me for the duration of my trip to Mars.
I've never been so glad to see the inside of my apartment before. In fact, I'd almost forgotten how much I hated that place. It was so dark, the furniture was ugly, and the walls were stained with stains that no amount of cleaning would ever remove. The only thing I loved about it was the bed. It reminded me of the one I'd slept in at home, and despite the dirt and dust, there was nothing wrong with it. I was exhausted and went straight to sleep the second I crawled inside.
The first thing I did when I woke up the following morning was look out of my bedroom window. As I expected, the weather was beautiful, and the air was clear. That meant my walk into town was going to be nice and easy.
After a quick shower, I ate breakfast and headed out the door. My apartment was only a few kilometers from the center of town, so as soon as I stepped outside, I started walking in the opposite direction. By the time I'd gotten to the edge of the city, I was already sweating, and by the time I got to my destination, I was soaked.
That was my second surprise of the day—I'd assumed the weather was always like this, but I'd actually forgotten about the atmosphere being thinner here on Mars. As I approached the research station, my eyes began adjusting to the sunlight and I could see that something was definitely amiss. Most of the buildings there had been torn down, there was blood splattered all over the ground, and the smell of smoke mixed with death was in the air.
I decided to wait and see what the police wanted me to do, since it appeared to be my task to find out who was responsible for this mess.",1300,-0.901374118874285,0.6160912358131809,1.2977374634442964,-0.2644825803613408,-0.8023116729523568
312,R_2woXR4CBsz1nGn5,ALL_HSF_9,Hard Sci-Fi,All-Nighter,Panel,"""I have a message for you from the president,"" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. ""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I had spent most of yesterday helping my friend and former colleague, Professor Matsuoka, get settled in with his new team of researchers, but now I was back home to grab lunch before heading back to the lab.
The day was still warm and dry, as it often is here in summer on the planet. I took a seat at one of the tables outside of a small food stall near the university's main entrance, where students were buying their lunches and chatting about their plans for the long weekend. As I waited for my order, I noticed Dr. Sato watching me from across the street with a curious expression on her face. I waved and smiled at her as she approached, but she seemed hesitant to talk to me.
""Are you busy right now?"" she asked when she reached me. ""I know we're not supposed to talk during our breaks, but I thought maybe there was something else I could do for you.""
I looked at her carefully, noticing that her hands were shaking slightly. I'd been working with Dr. Sato for over five years now, and I knew that she was always very careful with what she said around other people, especially those she didn't trust completely. She had been with the university for almost thirty years, and she wasn't just a colleague—she was also a close friend of mine. I was worried about her, so I decided to tell her the truth.
""Actually, Dr. Sato, I've got some good news,"" I told her, handing her the envelope. ""There's a job opening in my department. I think you should apply.""
She looked at the envelope in surprise and then stared at me suspiciously. ""Why are you telling me this?"" she asked. ""You don't have any reason to be nice to me right now, do you? I'm sure your boss doesn't like it if you spend time talking to me.""
""It's no big deal,"" I reassured her. ""I've just found out that the university needs someone to work in our lab on Earth. It's an assistant position, but it would be a great opportunity for you. And I thought maybe you might want to go home to Japan for a while. You've been here a long time, and I know that you miss your family and friends. I just thought...""
Dr. Sato shook her head angrily. ""I don't want to leave Mars,"" she said. ""And I'm not going to move to Earth. Not after what happened to me there. No way!""
""But the president wants us all to return to Earth for the next round of research,"" I argued. ""We have to find out why the Martians attacked our colony last year. He's planning to send the entire faculty back to Earth, so it makes sense that he'd want one of his top scientists to lead the team.""
Dr. Sato glared at me as I spoke. ""Don't talk to me about the president,"" she snapped. ""I think you should be ashamed of yourself for trying to get me to betray the trust I placed in you.""
She turned away from me and started walking quickly down the sidewalk, leaving me behind with my lunch. As she disappeared around the corner, I looked down at the envelope in my hand and frowned. The president had told me that Dr. Sato was one of the most promising young scientists on Mars, and he wanted to keep her working with him. I was sure that the job would be a great opportunity for her, but she didn't want to take it. That's when I realized why.
She had been here on Mars for almost thirty years, and she wanted to stay because she believed in the project. She loved Mars and everything it stood for—the people she worked with, the research she did, the work she was doing to make Mars a better place for future generations. And now she was going home? It wasn't fair to her, or to anyone else who cared about this place. If we were going to leave Mars, then we should do it together, not as a group of people who had nothing in common with each other.
As I sat there watching Dr. Sato disappear into the distance, I knew that I couldn't just sit back and watch her go. I had to tell her how I felt, and I had to do it right away. But where could I meet with her without raising any suspicions? I had only been home for an hour after helping Professor Matsuoka move in, and I didn't know where she would have gone already.
That's when I remembered a small café near the university where we often went to grab coffee together. The place was owned by a friend of mine named Akio, who also happened to be the best barista in all of Japan. I knew he would understand what I was going through, and I could trust him to keep our conversation private.
I walked up to the café and found Akio sitting at his usual table, sipping his coffee and reading the newspaper. He looked up as I approached and smiled warmly.
""You're late,"" he teased. ""I've been waiting here for over thirty minutes.""
I laughed and shook my head as I sat down across from him. ""Sorry,"" I said. ""I got caught up helping my colleague move into his new lab. Do you mind if I wait for a little while? I promise I won't take too long.""
Akio nodded, and we spent the next half hour talking about our favorite foods, TV shows, and movies. Finally, he sighed and pushed away from the table.
""I've got to get back to work,"" he explained. ""But I wanted to talk to you before you left today.""
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small box wrapped in shiny paper. I took it from him and opened it carefully. Inside was a silver ring, made from the same metal used on the rings that the colonists wear to mark their status. It was a symbol of the colony—the first of its kind ever created outside of Earth. And there was only one person in the colony who would ever give me a ring like this.
""Thank you, Akio,"" I whispered. ""I love you.""
Akio smiled and put his arm around my shoulder. ""I'm happy to hear that, Ken,"" he said. ""And I'm even happier to see you wearing it.""
He leaned closer and kissed me gently on the lips, and I closed my eyes as I felt his arms wrap around my waist and pull me close against him. He pulled away after just a few seconds, and we both stared at each other for a moment, smiling. Then he turned away from me and headed toward the door, leaving me alone with the ring.",1213,-0.8269271990264067,0.6756229230551831,-0.36588942799504925,-1.2280994177422526,-1.2467416897455808
313,R_2q8KoDs7X2QFoAH,FAN_HF_5,High Fantasy,Fandango,Panel,"The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees. The forest on either side had been cleared away for farming, but several large fields were empty as well.
""The last thing I saw before leaving,"" said Ryl, ""was that there was no one left alive here.""
""I don't think that's the case,"" replied Rheyn. ""Something is definitely amiss here.""
Kirr frowned at him. ""You sense something?""
Rheyn shook his head. ""No. But my senses tell me that this place is not what it seems. There are wards upon the land that hide it from those who do not belong. They would be very powerful, as the village does not appear to have been abandoned. Perhaps the villagers have long since moved on, as is common in these lands, but the wards are still in effect.""
""That is odd,"" remarked Ryl. ""There should be no way a ward could remain active so long after its original purpose has passed.""
Rheyn shrugged in response. ""It might be more accurate to say that it no longer serves any purpose, given that all signs of life are gone. It is not uncommon for old wards to become corrupted and forgotten over time.""
""So what if we can't get into the village?"" asked Kirr. ""Is something hiding on us, or inside of us? I'd rather figure out what is going on before we go searching for trouble.""
""That makes sense,"" said Ryl. ""It might also explain why everyone is dead. Perhaps they were attacked by whoever put the wards up.""
Ryl nodded slowly at the elf. ""Perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself, though. Let's keep things simple for now. We need to find somewhere to stay for the night.""
Rheyn pointed towards the east where a small cluster of buildings rose from behind a hill. As far as Ryl could tell, the structures were uninhabited and unkempt, but he didn't know how to discern whether or not that was normal. His only point of reference had been Laris, his home city. The buildings there had all been carefully maintained; some even painted in bright colors with ornate designs. Most had gardens attached as well which were tended regularly by the people living nearby. The structures in Ryl's world, though, were usually just abandoned or falling apart. Even the buildings that appeared to be well-tended still contained holes in the walls or had broken windows.
Ryl felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise at the sight of the dilapidated buildings. He turned to face the others, his heart racing. ""I don't want to stay in any of those places. They are clearly uninhabited, but something doesn't feel right about them. It's nothing specific, but I think we should camp near the lake.""
""You're right,"" said Rheyn. ""A few miles out from the village is probably best. We can make our way in the morning.""
They set off west and crossed the short distance to the shore before setting up camp in a grove of trees growing at the edge of the lake. They made their way around the water to a sandy beach and pitched their tents, then began making a fire under the shelter of a thick canopy of leaves. While Ryl had eaten many times in the course of the journey, he was hungry again once he began cutting up a piece of goat that Rheyn had carried all day on his back. The meat itself tasted better than he remembered from his time in Tymanther, and the flavor brought back pleasant memories of his past life.
As Ryl's stomach began to settle, he looked to the other members of his party. They sat around the fire, deep in conversation, while Ryl's thoughts drifted to what lay ahead. He had been so eager to leave the city, and yet, when he finally did, he found himself feeling unsettled. He had never been away from his family and friends for long periods of time, but somehow he thought it would feel different when he actually set out on his own. Instead, it felt like the same old routine, only with the added excitement of an upcoming adventure.
Rheyn had been silent for the last hour, occasionally taking sips of water from a leather bottle tied to his belt before passing it to Kirr. The elf had seemed quiet all day, and Ryl wondered what he thought about all of this. Did he feel the same as him? Was there something more going on in the shadows? If Ryl was being honest, he suspected that it might be because of him, and not him at all. After all, he hadn't done anything to cause the death of his father and grandfather, nor had he done anything to bring this group together, though they were all united in purpose now. Still, it was hard to shake the feeling that someone, or something, was following him. In fact, he was certain of it.
Ryl glanced over to where Rheyn sat. The elf was gazing up at the sky, his eyes wide open, watching the movements of the sun. The others were asleep already, curled up beneath blankets of their own. Ryl's mind drifted to what he had been told about Rheyn's past; that he grew up alone in the mountains, having been orphaned as a baby. For a brief moment, he wondered what his own childhood had been like. Had he always lived in the city? He pushed the thought aside and took another bite of his food.
He felt a gentle touch on his arm and turned to see that Kirr was staring at him. ""Are you okay?"" the elvish ranger asked.
Ryl nodded. ""Yeah.""
""Do you need to talk about something?""
Ryl smiled wanly. ""I'm fine, really. Just thinking about the future.""
The corners of Kirr's mouth turned down. ""About where we are going, or about something else?""
Ryl laughed. ""It's a little bit of both, really.""
Kirr shook his head. ""It sounds to me like there is a lot more on your mind than you want to admit.""
""What do you mean?"" asked Ryl.
""Well, for one, you've barely spoken all day,"" the elf replied. ""And when you do, you hardly sound like yourself.""
Ryl frowned. ""I guess I just find that difficult to talk about, especially right now.""
""Fair enough,"" said the ranger. ""But that doesn't mean you can't talk about it. Or that you can't start. You don't owe anyone an explanation.""
Ryl smiled. ""Thank you."" His eyes fell back to the fire. ""When you live as long as I have, you find that time passes quickly, and you realize how short it really is. You spend years chasing adventures, but in the end they tend to be over all too soon.""",1197,0.1732987083688089,-1.860545962527885,-0.5447425802089696,0.5687306913742287,-0.05553692693580024
314,R_1gdzafb9ZTHKacs,GEN_HR_5,Historical Romance,Genesis,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He'd been so busy with the customers that it had taken him almost ten minutes to notice she was there because he couldn't take his eyes off her.
He hadn't been able to figure out who she was until she spoke and it dawned on him that this was the same girl who'd been in here last night, asking about the innkeeper's wife. The woman he thought was dead. He'd assumed then that she must be related to the man, but now he knew better. How could he have made such an assumption? Why did everything keep coming back to that stupid tavern? So many things were going wrong for him lately—he needed something good to happen. Something really good. Like getting lucky tonight.
She'd sat down at the table, smiling as if she knew exactly what he wanted. God help him, why wasn't he able to stop thinking about her? He didn't even know her name or much else besides the fact that she looked like she should be playing a harp instead of sitting in a tavern, drinking ale. But as soon as they'd started talking, he realized that she seemed intelligent and not some simpleton. After all, she was obviously quite familiar with the area around their town. It wouldn't have surprised him to find out she was from London, which would make sense since she said she was traveling for a friend.
But he found himself wondering whether that meant she might be a witch. Some men in the village were convinced that witches were real, although no one had seen any proof. Still, every year on Samhain, more and more people were afraid of being attacked by witches. They believed them to be evil women who turned men into swine and ate babies. When he'd heard the story about how the woman had died, he hadn't been able to stop thinking about it. No matter how many times he tried, he just kept imagining that she was still alive and somehow managing to survive in the forest. Maybe he'd gone mad. That was probably what happened when you spent too long working in a tavern full of drunks. Or maybe it was something else altogether.
""Do you think she's really dead?"" he asked her, trying to change the subject before he embarrassed himself by saying anything else.
She frowned. ""I don't know.""
He nodded slowly, unable to take his eyes away from her. Her blonde hair fell over her shoulders and he wanted nothing more than to reach out and touch it. The way she moved made him think she was graceful. In fact, he wondered if she played the harp. Was he crazy? What kind of girl traveled alone?
She smiled again. ""You're staring,"" she whispered.
He blushed. ""Sorry.""
He'd never actually spoken to anyone other than the patrons at the tavern. He'd always been so shy he'd barely been able to order food without spilling it on himself. And now he was starting to talk to a beautiful woman? Who was he? It seemed unbelievable that someone like him could have the nerve to do such a thing.
""It's okay,"" she told him, reaching over to take his hand.
He was shocked by the feel of her fingers against his skin. He'd been thinking about touching her, but he'd never expected to actually accomplish it. Somehow, she'd managed to catch him completely off guard.
""Do you want to go somewhere private?"" she asked, looking up at him with her blue eyes.
His heart started pounding fast. What did she mean by that? Did she expect him to kiss her? He felt like he couldn't breathe, like something was pressing down on his chest.
""Yes!"" he blurted out, nodding quickly.
She smiled and stood up. ""Come on.""
""Where are we going?"" he asked, following after her.
""Just follow me,"" she replied, ducking through a door behind the bar and heading toward the rear of the building. It was dark in the hallway and he could only see her outline. A moment later, a light clicked on. He blinked several times, adjusting to the sudden brightness and realizing that there was another room beyond the one he'd entered.
After walking down a short flight of stairs, he came to a door that read ""Employees Only."" He stared at it in surprise, wondering what she was doing. Then he took hold of the handle and opened it.
The room was huge, almost as big as the tavern. There were rows and rows of shelves filled with jars. On the opposite wall, there was a large wooden tub and a couple of washbasins. Next to those, there was a small table with a candle on it.
""What is this place?"" he asked.
She grinned. ""This is my bathhouse.""
He looked around in amazement. This was an actual business! ""How often do people come here?"" he asked.
She shrugged. ""Every day.""
He turned to look at her. ""But...your house?""
""My father owns it,"" she explained, picking up a pitcher of water and pouring some into a basin.
""So you're rich,"" he said, staring at her. He couldn't believe he was standing in a place like this, talking to a girl like her.
Her smile widened. ""That's right. You'd better watch yourself, though. My brother is a bit of a bully.""
""A bully? Is he here now?""
She shook her head. ""No. He works during the day, but I'm sure he'll be home soon.""
He glanced around the room again. ""Why are you telling me all of this?""
She shrugged. ""Because I like you.""
""But..."" He paused, shaking his head. ""I don't understand. How can you like a stranger so much?""
""People say that I'm beautiful, but it doesn't matter how pretty you are if you aren't nice to others. If you act like a complete bitch, no one will ever want to spend time with you. All you have to do is show kindness to everyone, and they'll love you for it,"" she said, scrubbing her hands clean.
His mouth dropped open. ""You're like the most amazing person I've ever met!"" he exclaimed.
She laughed. ""Thanks. You're not half bad either.""
Then she reached out and grabbed his arm, pulling him closer to her. She leaned forward, and he froze, waiting to see if she was going to kiss him. Her lips brushed against his cheek, sending a shiver down his spine. Her sweet breath smelled like apples.
""Are you ready to get out of your clothes?"" she asked softly.
He nodded eagerly, suddenly overcome with lust. He was desperate to feel her soft skin against his own. He wanted to taste her lips and explore every inch of her body.",1159,0.956541176686447,0.7767755475733769,0.20889932570218325,-0.84227482597406,-0.6194000785329888
315,R_2cc4gSVoAzb1dmx,OUR_HOR_1,Horror,Ouroboros,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. A man's face, but it was too wide. The nose was too big and the jawline looked wrong.
""Who are you?"" I asked in English, not even sure if my voice came out in French or Spanish. ""Where am I?""
""You're in France,"" the face replied in a heavy accent. He said something else I didn't understand and I got a shiver down my spine when he smiled at me. It was an evil smile that sent chills up my arms. He must've been quite old because his hair had long gray strands in it. It was hard for me to see him through the reflection, but I could tell he had dark bags under his eyes.
""Where is here?"" I asked again.
""This is the castle of Jean-Baptiste DuBois,"" the old man said. ""You are in the mirror and the mirror is where you will stay forever.""
I started screaming then, but my voice did not come out in English or Spanish. All I could do was scream until my throat hurt. Finally, I ran out into the hallway and called 911. A few minutes later, they arrived with two police officers who were armed and ready for anything.
""Is everything all right? What happened?"" the female officer asked me.
I pointed to the mirror.
""A man's face has appeared in my mirror,"" I said. ""He says he is from France and is going to kill me if I don't come with him.""
The male officer grabbed me by the arm and tried to pull me out of the room.
""Let her go!"" the old man screamed at him.
When he did, the woman took off running. The man followed her out of the room and they both disappeared down the hallway.
The male officer helped me out of the room and told me to stay put as he searched the whole place for anyone else. After a while, the female officer came back and he led her to the mirror in the bathroom.
""What do you see?"" she asked.
""Just another mirror,"" he replied. ""There's no one behind it.""
We stood there staring at the mirror.
""Maybe he's gone now,"" the officer said.
""Not him,"" the woman insisted. ""That man isn't here anymore. It's him.""
She pointed to the mirror and I turned around. I knew who that was. I saw him through the reflection as he had appeared in the mirror. He smiled at me before he left, but I didn't think about it then. We finished searching the house and were leaving when we heard footsteps coming from the stairs. The woman jumped into the hallway, gun aimed at the intruder. When she realized it was just a young man in his twenties, she lowered the weapon.
""Sir, what are you doing in this house?"" she demanded to know.
""I'm looking for the owner,"" the young man said. ""I've been locked in my bedroom since last night.""
She stared at him for a moment.
""You're an idiot!"" she yelled. ""How can you not have heard any of our search? How could you even think to come in here without us knowing it?""
He looked confused by her response.
""I thought I might be able to get away unnoticed,"" he said.
I was watching the scene with great interest because I was sure that this guy was going to be the real killer.
""And how did you think you would do that?"" she asked. ""Didn't you hear the woman screaming in there?""
He shook his head and I couldn't understand why he would try to sneak up on anyone in a house that was clearly occupied.
""What do you mean?"" he asked.
""Listen to me,"" she said. ""The lady in that room has been stabbed over and over again, and you came up here as if it was the safest place you could be. You're a fool! The only reason I didn't shoot you right then and there is because I thought it might be your brother.""
""My brother?"" he replied.
""Yeah, Jean-Baptiste DuBois, and don't tell me you forgot who he is. You've been dreaming about him since yesterday.""
The young man shook his head.
""I haven't thought about any of that in a while, and I wouldn't dream about him if I did. He's dead.""
""Dead?"" the female officer asked. ""What happened to him?""
""He's dead because of me. He was my best friend back at school. We used to run together and even went to college together. That was when it all started. One day, he called me up and asked if he could stay with me. When I told him yes, he told me he wanted to take a trip to Paris.""
""Paris?"" the female officer asked. ""Why would he want to go there?""
The young man shrugged.
""He said he'd fallen in love with the city and had always wanted to visit. He planned on going for three days before returning home. That's what we were supposed to do, but I got so caught up in everything else that I forgot to mention anything about my friend. That's when I realized he hadn't returned. He didn't call me back or send me an email, so I tried calling him several times. After that, I drove around looking for him but never found him. That's when I started getting worried. I searched everywhere in Paris but could never find him. Finally, I had to accept the fact that he was dead. That was the day he died.""
I was stunned by what this young man said, and the woman didn't seem to believe him.
""Are you sure he wasn't kidnapped?"" she asked.
The young man shook his head.
""No! He left because of me!"" he shouted. ""If I hadn't made the mistake of telling him he could stay with me, then he would still be alive and happy.""
The female officer stared at him for a long time.
""Where is he?"" she asked finally.
The young man looked at her.
""Where did you get that mirror?"" he asked. ""And what does it have to do with everything?""
She didn't answer.
""You're an American,"" he said. ""Do you speak French?""
She nodded.
""Then ask him if he knows how to get to a place called Montmartre.""
She turned to look at me and I just stared back.
""Do you know where this man lives?"" she asked.
""He doesn't live here,"" I replied.
""Then who do you think we should search?""
I shrugged.
""You should look everywhere,"" the young man said. ""Because you can never be too safe.""
I started shaking my head, but before I knew it, the door to my room opened and two men wearing ski masks barged in.",1176,0.1749211846086665,1.5750164961992827,0.38460759030889763,-0.48255524236294767,-0.2350745646691641
316,R_Z93C2lMJu1KsjGF,MOR_HOR_5,Horror,Morpho,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. I screamed and fell to the floor. The face laughed at me.
I slowly got up and reached for the light switch. When I turned it on, the face was gone. I got back in bed and started to cry.
I'm scared. This is my last night here. Just a few hours until Dad gets here, and then we're going to my Grandma's house. I don't want to be here anymore.
I got out of bed again and went into the bathroom. I took off my clothes and got in the shower. I turned on the water and let it run over me as I cried.
I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to live here anymore. I just want to go home, home, home.
I stayed in the shower until there wasn't any hot water left. I turned off the water and wrapped a towel around myself as I dried off.
When I was done, I opened my closet and found my clothes. I picked out a baggy t-shirt and a pair of long shorts. They're so big on me, but at least they're clean.
I walked down the stairs and into the kitchen. The house didn't look empty; it was full of people sitting around drinking coffee and talking.
""Good morning,"" Mrs. Adams said as she passed me.
""Good morning,"" I said back to her as she went to her bedroom.
My mother was standing by the stove, cooking breakfast.
""Oh, good morning Katie,"" she said as she turned around. ""How do you like your eggs?""
""Over easy, please.""
""Coming right up.""
I sat down at the table and watched her make my breakfast as she talked to all of us at the table. She seemed happy, but I couldn't tell if that was just because it was Sunday or if she was actually happy to have us over for another week.
My father came in a few minutes later with his coat on and his briefcase in hand. He stopped in his tracks when he saw me sitting there. For a moment, he didn't say anything at all, but then he finally asked me how I was doing.
""I'm fine.""
He didn't say anything else to me until our breakfast was ready, at which point he started eating it as fast as he could while he talked to everyone else at the table.
When we were finished with breakfast, we got our coats on and went outside to the car. Mrs. Adams was standing there with a large bag in her arms, and she gave my father a hug when he got out of the car.
""I'm glad you came,"" she said to him while they hugged. ""You're always welcome here.""
""Thank you Mrs. Adams,"" he said to her as they pulled apart from each other. ""We'll be back next week.""
""Goodbye Katie,"" she said as she kissed me on the forehead and gave me another hug before my father could get out of the car.
""Bye Mrs. Adams,"" I said to her while I held onto her tightly for a few seconds before she went inside.
Then we were on our way again. The drive wasn't too bad this time; we were both tired from all of the excitement of moving and not having any sleep last night, so we both fell asleep during the drive up until we got here... or so we thought.
When we got into town, Dad pulled over at a gas station so that he could get some coffee before we got home, and I woke up when he opened my door for me from inside the car. When I got out of the car, something felt wrong, so I walked around to the other side of the car to see what was wrong with it. There was nothing wrong with it except for all of the blood that was caked on the metal bumper and hood where my head had been resting last night when he put me in the car. I screamed and ran back towards him so that I could get back into the car and out of there before anyone else in town saw me... or him... covered in blood...
When I got back into the car, Dad had already paid for our coffee and cigarettes... again... and we were on our way home once again without me even having a chance to talk to him about what had happened last night before he put me down for a nap again... or so we thought...
We finally made it home after stopping by Grandma's house for a little bit, and Mom didn't seem very excited about anything... until she opened up her jewelry box while we were in her bedroom putting things away from our bags where she kept everything in her room that she didn't want us to see... including her collection of dead husbands that she had stuffed in there before we came into town for Easter dinner this afternoon... or so we thought...
I woke up from my nap from hell about an hour before dinner was supposed to be served; I still wasn't sure if dinner was going to be served at all with how quiet everything had been around here since we'd gotten home from Grandma's house this afternoon... or so we thought... until Mom walked through the front door with a large bouquet of flowers... or what was left of them anyway... after what had happened this afternoon... or so we thought... until Dad came in about ten minutes later with Mom right beside him with their jackets on... or what was left of them after what had happened this afternoon... or so we thought... but when they walked into the dining room, they didn't seem like they were going to have anything to do with any dinner at all after what had happened this afternoon before we came home this evening... or so we thought... until Mom started talking about how she should have gotten more flowers earlier this afternoon... or so we thought... until Dad told us that he wanted to go outside for a little bit so that he could think about things before he decided whether or not he wanted dinner tonight after all after what had happened this afternoon... or so we thought... but then one of them came upstairs with us and put us back down for another nap this afternoon... or so we thought... but when Dad came upstairs about half an hour ago with his coat on and his briefcase in hand, they both seemed like they were going to have something to do with dinner after all after what had happened this afternoon when they put us both down for another nap this afternoon before dinner... or so we thought... but when we woke up an hour later from our nap from hell just before dinner was supposed to be served, they still didn't seem like they wanted anything to do with dinner after what had happened this afternoon before we came home this evening after what had happened this afternoon when they put us both down for another nap this afternoon before dinner... or so we thought... but then Mom walked through the front door with a large bouquet of flowers that were half dead before she put them on one of the dining room tables after what had happened this afternoon after she put us both down for another nap this afternoon before dinner... or so we thought...",1310,-0.6949934592303141,-0.46832486892303743,-0.1729565377044803,-1.3877830372887527,-0.5408222320985362
317,R_31sxLJ26LWOnnPW,ACE_HOR_3,Horror,Ace of Spade,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. The face had been cut in half. There were two black eyes with blood coming out of them and a mouth full of broken teeth. It was my own face.
""You're not real,"" I said aloud. ""You don't exist.""
The face just laughed at me as if he knew what I was thinking.
""That's right. You don't exist."" He continued laughing.
There was something behind him that wasn't visible but was still moving around. Something else came out of the mirror and grabbed my legs and pulled me in. As soon as it did, I felt like I couldn't breathe anymore.
""No!"" I screamed.
It seemed like forever before I passed out.
When I opened my eyes, I saw myself sitting on top of the bed. The thing that held me down was gone. My heart started racing when I realized what happened. That night, I had a nightmare about the same thing happening. This time, the mirror had no face in it, but I could see the thing that was holding me down. I tried to scream but nothing would come out. I closed my eyes so hard they turned white. I then fell asleep.
I didn't sleep very well that night because every time I would close my eyes, I could feel something grab hold of me. Every time I'd open my eyes, there would be an empty space where I'd seen whatever was going to kill me next. Then, I heard a voice calling my name. It sounded familiar but I couldn't remember who it belonged to. When I opened my eyes, there was a woman standing in front of me. She wore all white with red flowers scattered across her chest. Her long blond hair was tied in a bun. A veil covered her face. She smiled at me and then disappeared. I went back to sleep and didn't wake up for three days.
The next day, I sat down on the couch and stared blankly at the television. After watching some stupid show for a while, I got bored. I picked up the remote control and flipped through channels. I stopped on a channel that showed people getting their souls sucked out of their bodies. One person was being drained by someone wearing a mask. As soon as she took off the mask, the victim started screaming.
After this, I put on some music. I was playing some classical music when the doorbell rang. I answered the door and found a girl standing outside. She looked to be about fourteen years old and had shoulder length brown hair. She wore jeans and a green t-shirt.
""Hi. Are you Michael?"" she asked.
""Yeah, I'm Michael. Can I help you?"" I replied.
""My mom told me to find the owner of this house and tell him his wife is here to see him.""
""What? Your mother sent you to get me? Why?""
""She doesn't know why. All she knows is that your wife has been missing since yesterday morning.""
""Missing how?""
""She hasn't left her room yet, but I've been watching the news and they say she ran away from home.""
""Oh my God! Did she leave a note or anything?"" I asked.
""Nope, but my mom says it's weird that she hasn't called anyone. Plus, she wouldn't do that to her husband.""
""Your mother's right. She wouldn't run away from home. Where are you supposed to meet her?""
""At the police station.""
""Okay. Thanks."" I gave her directions to the police station and watched as she walked away.
I decided to go check on my wife. I knocked on the door but no one answered. I opened the door and looked inside. No one was there. I checked the bathroom and bedroom but she was nowhere to be found.
As I was leaving the house, the door slammed shut and locked itself. I pounded on the door and yelled, but no one responded.
""Damn it!"" I shouted.
Then I heard the sound of footsteps walking towards me. When I turned around, the figure appeared in the doorway. It was a man with a long beard and dirty clothes. His eyes were sunken and his skin was pale. He carried a pitchfork and a cross.
He reached for me with the pitchfork, but I stepped out of reach. He threw the cross at me, but it bounced off my body.
""Who are you?"" I demanded.
""I am the Devil,"" he replied. ""And I have come to take your soul.""
""I don't think so,"" I said as I kicked him in the shin.
He screamed in pain and dropped the pitchfork. He then grabbed me and threw me against the wall. I hit my head and lost consciousness.
I woke up to the feeling of something crawling under my skin. I tried to pull it off but I couldn't. It was like trying to lift a car with my bare hands.
""Help me,"" I pleaded.
Suddenly, a bright light filled the room and I couldn't move any more. I opened my eyes and saw the same thing that was in the mirror. It was coming after me.
""Please, please don't hurt me. Please, just let me live,"" I begged.
""That's too bad. Because now you're mine. And you will serve me.""
""No! Don't kill me. I beg you! I'll do anything! Just don't kill me!""
""Very well. But I can always bring you back. So you better watch yourself.""
""Why? What makes you different than him? You both want to torture me!""
""We aren't like him. We don't enjoy hurting our victims. In fact, we hate it. Now, get ready for what's coming next.""
""No!"" I screamed.
A loud noise like thunder exploded in my ears. My vision went dark and I couldn't hear anything. I thought I was going to die. Then I felt something warm and soft touch my lips. The thing that was in my mouth tasted like sweet candy. It was like the best thing I ever had in my life. The creature that was torturing me disappeared. I was alone again.
I thought I was dreaming until I felt something poking me in the ribs. I opened my eyes and saw a boy about eight years old with short brown hair.
""Where did you come from?"" I asked.
""You mean the monster in your dreams?""
""Yes!""
""Well, I was the monster. I came out of the mirror. I was the one that was doing all those terrible things to you.",1136,-1.189332247240062,0.2269233099414044,0.2385886748207869,-0.0008267000640839531,0.11181711238311182

""He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon."" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The temperature had risen considerably since yesterday, when it'd been below freezing outside.
It wasn't uncommon for me to be called upon by the president, but today's meeting would be different than any other time I'd met with him before. Today, he wanted to talk about our plans for the future. He knew what I thought about the situation; he just didn't want anyone else to know yet. That meant only three people were going to be present at the meeting: myself, the president, and Dr. Sato.
The president's office was located in a large white building near the center of the city. We entered through its front doors and walked down a long hallway until we reached one of many elevators. When it opened up, we stepped inside and rode it all the way to the top floor. Once there, we exited the elevator and went straight toward another set of double glass doors. As soon as they slid open, we walked into the president's private office.
President Taggart sat behind his desk, looking out at us with a serious expression on his face. His hands rested on the edge of his desk, and his eyes seemed to be focused somewhere far away. ""You've done well so far,"" he began after a moment of silence. ""But now is not the time to rest on your laurels. There are still more problems to solve.""
""Yes sir,"" I replied. ""We're working hard every day to find solutions.""
""I'm aware of that,"" President Taggart answered. ""However, we need to take things a step further. You'll be given additional resources to continue your work, and I expect you to make good use of them. If we don't get these problems solved, then we may never leave this planet again.""
I nodded in agreement. ""Understood.""
""Good,"" he said, standing up from his chair. ""Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some meetings to attend to. Dr. Sato will show you to your new offices while I'm gone."" He turned around and left the room without waiting for a response.
Dr. Sato led us out of the office and back down the hall. She stopped in front of a door and handed me a key card. ""This should get you into the building. Just go right past the receptionist and head upstairs. Room 203 is where you'll be staying. Your assistant has already been assigned to you, and she'll be showing you how everything works once you arrive.""
""Thank you,"" I said.
She smiled. ""Don't mention it. Now, I must return to my duties. Have a nice day!"" With that, she turned and headed off down the hallway.
After leaving Dr. Sato, I made my way across the lobby and into the elevator. When the doors opened up, I stepped inside and pressed the button for the third floor. After a few seconds, the doors closed, and the elevator started moving upward. I looked at the numbers above the doors as they counted upwards, watching the digital display count up to the top floor.
When the doors opened up, I stepped out onto a large hallway. A sign hanging next to the entrance read ""Office of the President."" At the end of the hall, I saw two men dressed in black suits talking to each other. They both had dark hair and wore sunglasses even though it was daytime. One of the men held a briefcase, and the other man had a tablet computer in his hand.
As I approached, the man with the tablet computer turned around and gave me a nod. ""Hello, Mr. Smith,"" he said. ""Welcome to the office.""
""Thanks,"" I replied. ""I appreciate the warm welcome.""
""Not a problem,"" he responded. ""Just doing our job.""
I nodded and continued walking down the hallway until I reached a set of double glass doors. I pushed one of them open and walked inside. Inside the room was a woman sitting behind a large wooden desk. Her short blonde hair was neatly combed, and she was wearing a blue business suit.
""Mr. Smith?"" she asked.
I nodded. ""That's me.""
""Please, have a seat,"" she said, gesturing to one of the chairs in front of her desk. I sat down and waited for her to finish typing something on her computer.
""So, you're the new guy,"" she said, finally looking up from the keyboard and giving me a smile. ""How do you like it so far?""
""It's been pretty great so far,"" I replied. ""Everyone's been very welcoming.""
""Excellent,"" she said. ""I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's get you set up.""
She got up from her chair and walked over to a cabinet that was built into the wall. She pulled out a small box and placed it on the table in front of me. ""This is your badge,"" she said, holding it up for me to see. ""You'll need this to access most areas of the building, including your office. You can also use it to get into your apartment.""
""Oh, okay,"" I said, taking the badge and placing it in my pocket. ""Where exactly am I supposed to put this thing? My pockets are full of stuff already.""
""There's a drawer under the table,"" she answered. ""If you'll look there, you'll find a small metal plate. Place the badge on top of it, and it'll lock in place.""
I did as she told me and watched as the badge locked itself into place. ""Okay, thanks,"" I said, getting up from the chair and walking over to the cabinet.
""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" she asked.
""No, that's it,"" I said. ""I think I'm good to go.""
""Great,"" she said. ""Well, I'll let you get settled in. If you need anything, just give me a call.""
With that, she turned around and left the room. I picked up the box and carried it over to the cabinet, placing it inside the drawer and closing the door. Then, I walked over to the window and looked out at the view of the city.
I was in the middle of the city, surrounded by buildings and people. The windows were tinted slightly, blocking out the sunlight. I could see the tops of the tall buildings poking out from behind the clouds. In the distance, I saw a large dome-shaped structure. It was probably the science facility that we used to study the planet's environment.

319,R_22tXrY7pY0Pgxhf,BAS_HOR_2,Horror,Basic Coherence,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It was a woman's face but with horns growing from her head. She had long black hair that went down to her waist and dark eyes. Her lips were full and she had a small nose. There was no color to her skin or any other distinguishing features except for the horns. They stood straight up above her forehead like an animal's would. As soon as I saw them, they started moving and grew longer and larger. The more they grew, the less human they became. I backed away from the mirror in fear when I felt something grab my ankle. I fell backwards onto the floor and screamed. My husband came running over to see what happened. He picked me up off the ground and asked if I was okay. I told him that someone grabbed my leg and tried to pull me under the water. He ran to get some help while I sat on the edge of our tub.
The next day we moved to another house. We didn't tell anyone about the incident because we both knew people would think we were crazy. That night I woke up screaming. I couldn't move and all I could do was watch myself sleep. I watched myself turn into a demon before my very eyes. I turned into a monster. I watched my body grow long arms and legs. Then I watched as my hands grew claws and sharp teeth appeared in my mouth. I looked at my husband sleeping beside me and smiled. I wanted to kill him so bad. I wanted to rip his heart out and eat it. But then I remembered how he saved me last time. I stopped smiling and began to cry. I cried until I passed out. The next morning I woke up and saw that I was still alive. I was relieved because I thought I killed myself in my dream. I went downstairs and found my husband sitting at the kitchen table. He told me that he saw me standing behind him in the kitchen. He said that I looked like a demon and he couldn't look at me without being afraid. I apologized for scaring him. After breakfast, I took a shower. While I was washing my hair, I noticed blood coming from underneath the sink. I opened the cabinet door and pulled out a knife. I cut my arm open and let the blood drip down the drain. I put the knife back where I found it and washed my wound. I cleaned the bathroom and made sure everything was in order before I went back to bed. I slept peacefully that night and didn't have any dreams. I figured that maybe I was just going crazy and needed to go see a doctor.
When I woke up the next morning, I went to take a shower and saw that the blood was gone. I was confused because I never used the bathroom sink to wash my wounds. I decided to clean it anyway and make sure nothing was wrong. I wiped down the sink and realized that there wasn't any blood on the towel. I was shocked because I had seen it with my own eyes. I called my husband and told him about it. He told me not to worry because it must be a coincidence. He said that he doesn't believe in anything supernatural and that I'm probably just imagining things. He said that I need to relax and stop worrying.
Later that night, I went to use the bathroom and saw that the blood was back. This time I didn't clean it off. I left it there and went to bed. The next morning, the blood was gone again. I was starting to get worried. I decided to call my mom and ask her if she had ever heard of this happening before. She told me that she has heard stories of people seeing demons in mirrors but she never believed them. She said that if you want to know what's real, you should try asking your grandmother. I thanked her and hung up. I got online and searched for information on demons in mirrors. I read all kinds of different articles. Some said that if you stare into a mirror long enough, you will become one. Others said that if you look into a mirror and don't blink, you'll die. One article even said that if you look into a mirror and smile, you'll have good luck. I laughed at that one. I decided to test it out and stared at the mirror for several minutes. Nothing happened. I blinked and went on with my life.
A few days later, I was taking a bath when I heard the sound of scratching on the wall. When I looked, there was a face staring back at me. It was a man's face but with horns growing from his head. His eyes were yellow and his mouth was filled with sharp teeth. I screamed and jumped out of the tub. My husband came running over to see what happened. He picked me up off the ground and asked if I was okay. I told him that someone was trying to scare me. He laughed and said that I was imagining things. He told me that I was too old to be scared by silly things like that. He said that I needed to get over it and stop acting like a child. He went back to watching TV and I went to bed.

I tried to scream, but my mouth was dry. Then I noticed my hand was in a cast. The woman's hand looked like mine until she started screaming, then they were reversed. ""Help! Someone help me!"" I cried. But no one came because I had fallen asleep.
The next morning, I decided to see if there was any coffee in the kitchen. There wasn't much and it was burnt. It smelled like someone had smoked weed before making it. When I went outside, I found two police officers waiting for me. One of them had dark curly hair while the other's hair was short with a black mustache. They had blue eyes and white shirts on.
""Can we talk with you?"" the blonde cop said.
I nodded and followed him to his car. He turned on some classical music and asked me all about what happened last night.
""Weird right? My name is Jane, what's your names?"" I asked.
""My name is Brian and this is Robert,"" he answered.
""I'm so sorry to wake you up at this time in the morning, but we really need you to tell us about what happened. We think it might be important, and we would hate to see anything happen to you,"" Robert said.
""Nothing happened. I had a bad dream. What do you mean it might be important?"" I said.
""Jane, we have reason to believe that the killer is in the area,"" Robert said.
""What?! Really, why? You should probably tell someone else than the person who is the victim,"" I said.
""The killer usually shows up before midnight. He kills whoever is in the house at the time. And then he takes their organs out. This has been happening since the 1950's.""
""Well, my parents moved here when they were teenagers. They got married and never left,"" I said.
""Well, that's good. There is only a small chance of anyone being the next victim. Let's just hope that doesn't happen,"" Robert said.
The police officers drove off, and I decided to make some coffee. Then I heard another knock on the mirror.
""Who is it?"" I called out.
""I'm coming in!"" a woman's voice answered.
""Just a second,"" I said as I closed the door behind me. ""What are you doing here?""
""I thought I'd come over for a cup of tea. I figured you had enough to do without worrying about me,"" she answered.
""What made you think that?""
""You didn't seem like a murderer yourself,"" she said as she took a seat.
""Yeah, well, I don't want to go to jail. I don't know what to say or do if the cops come back,"" I said.
""So, you've been a real help today,"" she said. ""How about we play a little game to pass the time. I'll start with a question. Who is the most famous person in the world?""
""What?"" I asked.
""You can't say anyone. The person you say, I will make sure no one knows the answer,"" she said.
""All right, I'll give it a shot. You want to hear something really dumb? What about the Pope? He is pretty famous,"" I said.
""Wrong,"" she said. ""What about Marilyn Monroe?""
I was stumped. ""No, that's not it either.""
""We're going to keep playing until you say the right answer. One more question,"" she said. ""Who is the smartest man who ever lived?""
""How could anyone be the smartest man who has ever lived? I would have to meet him,"" I said.
""Sorry to say, you never will,"" she said.
""I'm done. I just can't get past one. If you could do that to me, you can take over the world!"" I said.
""Of course, but I won't. Not yet. But when you least expect it, I will show up and then you will be in the middle of my world,"" she said as she walked off into the house.
""This isn't like me at all. I mean, I had coffee and was feeling fine,"" I thought to myself.
I went back into the house, took a shower, and got dressed. After I was finished getting ready, I decided to go out for some fresh air. I opened the door to see if I could find something good to eat. On my way home, I was about to turn off the road, but I heard someone call me from behind me.
""Jane, are you there?"" a man said.
I turned around to see him sitting on top of a garbage can. His skin was black and his eyes were green.
""My name is Robert. You look lost, can I help you?"" he said.
""Well, I am. I have no idea where I'm going. The only thing I know is that I want to go back to my house. But how am I supposed to get there if I don't even know where it is,"" I asked.
""Well, I will walk with you until I can figure out what's going on. It sounds like the killer is close, so we should hurry. Are you a fan of classical music?"" he asked.
""No, I hate it, especially that one."" I said, pointing to the classical music playing outside.
""We are about to cross over to the other side. We might be able to stop him from doing any more harm,"" he said.
I followed him across the road and he led me to an old house that was falling apart. He knocked on the door, but there was no answer. Then he unlocked the door and we stepped inside. When we got in, it was dark and cold. There was dust everywhere and the air smelled of mold.
""Do you think someone is here?"" I asked.
""Let's check, and we will find out,"" he said.
When we walked through the first room, I noticed it was very clean. We went upstairs and it looked untouched. Then we came to a bedroom that had a single bed, a nightstand, a dresser, and a closet. When I opened the door to the closet, there were no clothes inside, but a girl's face was looking back at us. She wore the same clothing as the woman I had seen before.
""Are you the killer?"" she asked.
""That's not your job. Why are you in this house?"" Robert asked.",1122,-1.2303689411147156,-0.3047204251266631,0.6797322215447003,0.4274711922665983,-0.5753507765289984
321,R_bIaTHRxIx8aFevL,LOW_HR_5,Historical Romance,Low Rider,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. A beautiful creature in black leather and red silk, with an air of mystery about her. He didn't know why she caught his eye as he served drinks to customers, but when her eyes met his... well, he could only stare, mouth agape for several seconds before he could think clearly again and make himself get back to work. But it was too late; she'd seen him looking at her, and now he had no idea what to do next.
She wasn't wearing a sword—that much he knew for certain—so he didn't feel any danger from her at that moment. Yet, as soon as he got away from the bar area to go back on service duty, someone tried to mug him. Luckily, two of his friends were nearby at their table, and they took care of it quickly enough. He never asked who they were, even though they'd told him, simply because he liked not knowing anything about them. They made sure the man got away without killing or hurting anyone—except for the mugger—and left him lying half-dead in the street after giving him a few more bruises than needed. Then they went off to have fun elsewhere.
He couldn't forget how she looked as she walked by. Not just once either; several times she passed him, and each time it was different. The first time there was such fire in her eyes he thought she might start shooting him out of hand for looking at her. The second time she looked down at the ground, almost hiding her face. The third time she smiled at him, although briefly. And then she turned to walk away. By the fourth time she passed by his table, she was smiling at him again.
""I don't think so,"" she said, when he finally managed to say something to her. ""You're not my type."" Her voice was low and throaty, yet sweet and gentle at the same time. He couldn't remember having heard anything more beautiful in his life.
""Why's that?"" he asked, feeling like a fool even as he spoke. How could he ask her that, when she obviously wanted nothing to do with him? And why would she tell him anyway, if all he had going for him was a nice smile?
""Well, I've never been interested in men who work in taverns. Especially ones who look like you do.""
That stung, but not too badly. ""So what do you want?"" he asked, trying hard to sound like he hadn't taken offense at her words. Or maybe it was his looks she didn't like? He certainly wasn't ugly or anything; he'd had a lot of admirers over the years. But none of them came close to her. ""Maybe some of your fancy dresses?"" he joked, trying to lighten the mood between them. ""Or perhaps jewelry, to keep you safe and warm through the cold winter months?""
Her laughter filled the room, and she reached out and touched his chin lightly, making him grin. ""Oh, you can keep your jewels to yourself, mister! I wouldn't take them off unless I absolutely had to.""
""And how are we going to know when that happens?"" he asked.
She laughed again, shaking her head at him while still looking down at the table top in front of him. ""I'm not telling you anything,"" she finally said, then stood up.
He felt so stupid. What had he expected her to say? That he was the most handsome man she'd ever seen, and she'd be happy to give him whatever he wanted from her? Of course not, silly! She probably wanted to get rid of him. No wonder she hadn't wanted to talk to him earlier; she didn't know him at all, after all. He'd been a bit of a flirt, asking her questions that were completely unnecessary, and she'd gotten tired of his attitude and decided to ignore him. So, what did she mean, he couldn't take off her clothes? If she didn't want to see him anymore, she should just tell him.
Instead, she'd made him feel like a total idiot. He'd thought maybe she could help him find what he was looking for—a wife, to raise a family with and live happily ever after—but now he wasn't even sure that was possible. After all, it was obvious she didn't want to see him again, not really. She'd just said so. Now he wished he could call off his search altogether, because it seemed to be useless. He would never find anyone like this woman; there was no chance she'd marry someone like him.
""Hey,"" he called out, when she'd walked past him on her way out of the tavern.
""What?"" she replied, but she stopped walking and turned back toward him.
""Don't go just yet!"" he cried, realizing what a fool he must have looked like pleading with her like that. ""I'm sorry I bothered you."" He started backing away, hoping she didn't notice how pathetic he sounded.
""Oh, I don't mind talking to you,"" she replied, sounding amused. ""But you're a little young for me, and not very good looking, either.""
His heart sank. ""I'm sorry I wasted your time,"" he muttered miserably.
""No need to apologize,"" she said softly. ""I actually enjoy being around you.""
He stared at her in shock. ""How did you know that?""
""Because I can tell,"" she replied. ""And you haven't bothered me since you apologized, so let's leave it at that."" With that she turned around and walked out of the tavern, leaving him staring after her in utter disbelief. What was happening here? Had she changed her mind about wanting to avoid him, or was he imagining things? Either way, the idea that she might like him made his heart soar in joy. He couldn't believe it was real; it had to be a dream. But it seemed to be more than a dream...
""Hello?"" A female voice cut through his thoughts as he sat at the bar again, waiting for customers to order drinks. When he looked up, he found the beautiful woman standing in front of his table, looking down at him.
""Hi there,"" he said shyly, unable to take his eyes from hers. ""I hope I'm not bothering you. You just surprised me by showing up like that.""
""I thought you looked familiar,"" she replied, leaning forward slightly toward him. ""I think we talked to each other last week. But I don't remember your name.""
He shook his head. ""Not that it matters. My friends call me Dovian.""
""Dovian?"" She frowned for a moment, but then smiled. ""That's a strange name, if you don't mind me saying so.""
""It means 'dream' in a foreign language,"" he explained, smiling back at her.",1164,-1.0410149867578267,-0.47503800098637666,-0.8165270783806959,-1.15279439201297,-1.0955812298457726
322,R_27mcjbgFbkSLaPO,LOW_HOR_5,Horror,Low Rider,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. My eyes went wide as I realized that this wasn't a reflection. The woman smiled at me as she leaned in close so I could smell her sweet scent. She had dark red hair that hung down to about her shoulders and was cut straight across. Her lips were full with red lipstick and her cheeks were rosy. There were two freckles on her nose like she'd been running through a field all day, which would make sense because her skin was tan. As she moved closer, I could see the outline of breasts beneath her white top. They were firm and looked perky as they pushed against the thin fabric of her top. She reached behind her back and pulled open the front button before unclasping it completely and letting it fall to the ground. The rest of her clothes followed soon after revealing herself entirely to me. The black bra covering her breasts only covered them enough for decency. Her panties matched her bra, both coming down just below her ass and ending in small bows. This woman was stunningly beautiful.
""Are you ready?"" she asked with a smile and a wink. ""I can show you things that no one has ever seen."" I was stunned and couldn't believe what I was hearing.
""What is going on here?!"" I yelled as my heart pounded in my chest. I felt like something was trying to escape from inside me. It wanted out! The woman laughed before walking away from the mirror. Before I could run for safety, she turned around and began to strip off her clothes. She didn't take any of them off though. Instead, she just dropped them where they fell. Soon, she stood naked except for her boots.
""You want me now don't you?"" she said as she bent over and grabbed her ankles. She spread her legs apart and raised her ass towards me. ""Do you think about touching my perfect body while you're alone? Do you touch yourself when you're thinking of my lips kissing your shaft?"" I couldn't answer her questions because I wasn't sure if she was talking to me or not. ""Well, then why don't we do this together!"" she said as she sat down on the edge of the tub and slid her hands between her legs. She rubbed her pussy before sliding two fingers inside of her and moving them in and out rhythmically. It was clear that she enjoyed pleasuring herself in front of someone else.
It made me wonder how many times this had happened already and who it had happened with. Did she have a boyfriend or husband? Was it a friend? Did she use sex toys? How long had it been since someone saw her naked? I was so consumed with curiosity that I couldn't look away. I wanted to know more about this woman and how far she would go with me. I had to try and get some answers, but what could I possibly say that would make her trust me enough to tell me everything? If only I could get out without having to hurt myself, I could always find another way. But I was still trapped in the room.
As the woman masturbated, I watched closely and listened. It took me a few seconds to realize what she was saying. She was describing every movement that she made, making it seem like I was watching her through a camera or something. I couldn't move away either because the door wouldn't open from the other side and she could walk right through the walls too. She stopped rubbing herself for a moment and spoke in a soft voice, ""I love when people watch me play with myself. I've never met anyone that I liked so much. I wish you would stay the night, but I'll understand if you need to leave early.""
This was all getting out of hand. What did I get myself into? Maybe I should end this before it gets any worse than this... But she was so damn sexy! And it was obvious she knew how to use her body in ways I couldn't begin to imagine. Plus, I'm sure she's not the only one here. How many others have she been with since I got here? How many men have watched her masturbate and cum? How many women have done the same? She must be an expert because she was giving me such a good show. If she kept up what she was doing, I would probably cum right there on the spot.
""I can't wait anymore,"" she whispered as she continued to rub her fingers inside of herself. She looked like she was about to cum so I decided to stop watching and focus on something else. It didn't take long for my curiosity to get the best of me again though. So I started watching her again, wondering how far she would let me watch her go.
She came pretty fast for someone that was being watched by another person. Her body tensed up as she screamed out her release and shuddered several times before collapsing onto the floor, her fingers still buried deep inside of herself. After a minute, she regained her composure and slowly stood up from the ground. She was covered in sweat and breathing heavily. Her whole body glistened like it had been drenched in water. She walked over to the mirror and looked at herself, checking out her naked body.
""So, are you going to keep staring at me or are you going to join me?"" she asked with a smirk. She was enjoying this too much for my liking.
""If you don't mind, I would love to join you,"" I replied as I stepped closer to the mirror and watched her reaction.
She laughed loudly and slapped her hand over her mouth before turning to me. ""I guess it was too soon to ask that,"" she said smiling. As soon as she turned back towards the mirror, she began to undress again.
""You know, I bet it would feel even better if we were touching each other,"" she said seductively as she slid off her panties and stood completely nude once more. ""But I suppose this will do for now."" She reached behind herself and unclasped her bra, leaving it hanging from her arms. She held her breasts up for me to see before dropping them back down to her sides. Once the bra hit the ground, she bent down and picked it up. She placed it under the sink, presumably to clean later. She turned back to face me and walked over to where I was standing. Then she kneeled down in front of me.
""Now what?"" she asked, leaning forward with her hands on my knees. She smelled incredible. I wondered if she always smelled this nice or if she used perfume. Or maybe something stronger!
""Um..."" I stammered. I wasn't really sure what to do now that she had knelt down so close to me. Her breasts were almost at eye level, and they looked great. Her skin was pale and smooth; her nipples were small and hard against her skin. They were perfectly round and pink, just like the rest of her. I reached out and ran my fingers along one of her nipples, feeling her soft skin with my fingertips.",1285,0.08608176364762413,0.007879840626389755,0.8409543706730662,-1.1260024486715305,-0.7705925789224418
323,R_3Djbl0GDMpsjCmq,OUR_HR_6,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. She wasn't anything special to look at—not beautiful or ugly, but young and very, very naïve. He'd watched as she ordered food, then paid for it with a gold piece that had probably cost more than what he made in three days of hard work. The thought irritated him and he'd nearly blown his cover, just so he could have a chance to teach her a lesson about money.
But there was something in the way she moved that was different from all the other girls who frequented the inn—and most of those men. This one, at least, moved differently, almost like she knew what she was doing when she walked. It took him a long while to recognize it—it wasn't something he'd ever seen before; certainly nothing like the swaying movements of a dancer. He realized, then, that she was different on top of being naive. She'd never known anything but innocence in life and didn't understand that the world was harsh and cruel. And he wondered if she'd ever even felt pleasure.
When her food came, he watched her eat it. Not just that she ate it, which was normal for most people—but how she ate it. He could see in her eyes, just for a moment, that she was afraid to touch her food. She glanced at him, looking for help, and he saw that she had no idea what to do. He should have told her, then, that he would take care of her order for her, but instead, he had his own meal.
After he'd eaten and taken a seat at a nearby table, she wandered out onto the street, where he found her and took her back into the tavern.
He asked her questions about herself. She gave him answers—usually the same ones over and over again—but after a time, they weren't the same.
He couldn't bring himself to tell her what to do or how to act, but she grew more confident with each day. Soon, she was ordering her own food and taking care of herself. When she got bored, she went out to walk around, to see what was there for her to see.
She met people. Her first experience with anyone who wasn't from her small village was a boy who was staying in the inn. She thought he might be nice to her, so she talked to him—and he tried to make her feel uncomfortable. But she ignored him and kept walking. Then she found another boy, who seemed to like her, and they walked together.
A couple of days later, she stopped talking to any other person. When he saw her look up at him as they strolled along the street, he knew something was wrong. He asked her, and she told him about her village.
He hadn't been thinking at all; he just took off in a direction that would bring them closer to her home. When they finally reached it, he realized he had no idea where to go from there. And worse, there was no one there at the moment. He knew better than to wait for hours outside the house of an unknown child—especially a young girl who'd obviously never been far from her parents. So they set out to find some place to stay for the night, since he'd paid the innkeeper for the room for two nights.
They didn't talk much during the entire journey, and that worried him. Finally, though, when they were in a town that seemed to be quite well-off and safe, he said, ""Why did you stop talking?""
""You're not a bad person,"" she told him.
He knew exactly what she was talking about, but he wasn't about to apologize for it.
""But you have rules about how people treat each other,"" she continued.
She wasn't making much sense, but then again, neither were his thoughts. She must've known that he'd never met anyone else like himself, someone who lived by rules rather than feeling and instinct.
He'd been raised with those rules—from the time he could understand them, in fact—and he never questioned any of them. He simply accepted them as truth.
That didn't mean he didn't have feelings, or that he didn't get angry sometimes. But he also had learned how to control that anger and use it when necessary. And he'd learned long ago how to keep himself under control at all times. He couldn't let her see that, however, so he just nodded.
""I guess you have rules too, don't you?"" she asked.
He smiled, wondering why she thought that. He didn't have any rules he was aware of, certainly not the way she meant it.
She saw the smile on his face, though, and that puzzled her even more. ""What are your rules?""
He hesitated, then said, ""If I think of something important enough to put in a rule, it's not a good thing. It means the world needs to change.""
She laughed, which surprised him. ""Do you think the world is perfect?""
He shrugged. ""It can be.""
""But it's not,"" she countered.
She was right. They'd left the town soon after that.
They traveled through many villages and towns, stopping every now and then for supplies or to take a break from the road. But she refused to talk to anyone but him and he couldn't stand that. She wouldn't listen to reason. If he wanted her to speak with someone else, he had to make her do it.
He tried everything, even hitting her once, but that didn't work either. So they set out again. When he suggested stopping for the night, she refused to go near any building; if the people of a village had anything to do with her, it meant that she would've been punished—or worse.
When she finally stopped at the inn where he was staying, the next morning, he asked her to leave. She followed him without hesitation, but only after he'd given her money for food and drink.
She never stayed long. At first, she seemed to enjoy their travels, but after a few weeks, she started complaining. The food was horrible in the cities, the people were loud and rude and there wasn't any place to run and play.
That's when he realized that she was just like his sisters—the ones who'd gone to live with his uncle. He'd seen them so often in those few months before he left for the army that he knew exactly how they behaved.
She, however, didn't have anyone to help her. She didn't know what to do and no one ever taught her. If she didn't have a child to raise, someone to care for, then she had nothing to keep her busy. That's why she became bored. But she never understood that the world could be different, and that the way things were now was the best thing she could ask for.
""I don't think the world needs to change,"" he told her one evening as they walked along the street.",1211,-1.2217303645672615,-1.4828387841686153,-1.2184446633049208,-1.155674124649059,0.15650247143887352
324,R_2uquBKbXxhDsUq9,ACE_HOR_4,Horror,Ace of Spade,Panel,"I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It had a large nose that looked like an elephant's trunk with two large nostrils. The mouth was small and thin. Its eyes were small, but they seemed to be staring straight through me. There was a long black hair covering its head. This wasn't just any old man. It was a demon! I screamed and ran downstairs. My parents came running as well, and my dad called 911. We all stayed together in our living room waiting for the police. They said someone would be here shortly.
It was only ten minutes later when the doorbell rang. I opened it to see the sheriff standing outside. He asked if he could come inside. As soon as he stepped foot inside, he fell to his knees and began screaming. He then grabbed my father by the shirt and started shaking him violently. All this time, I'm still sitting on the couch holding my mom's hand. After a few seconds, the sheriff calmed down and sat back in his chair.
""What happened?"" My mom asked. ""Is everything okay? Did something happen to you guys?""
""No,"" the sheriff replied. ""We're fine. We have another situation going on right now.""
My mom gave us a confused look and went upstairs to her bedroom. I followed after her and found the sheriff lying on the floor with a knife sticking out of his chest. My mother knelt next to him and pulled it out. Blood poured out of him as she held the wound closed with both hands. She looked at me and said, ""This isn't real. You must get up!"" Then, she pushed me off the bed and onto the floor.
She turned to the sheriff and said, ""Get up. Get up or we will die here today!"" He didn't move. She took one last glance around the house before she left. Everything disappeared except for myself. I was floating above the ground and watched the whole thing play out. Once the sheriff finally stood up, he became a monster too. He grabbed his wife by the neck and slammed her against the wall. He threw her across the room where she hit her head hard against a dresser. His body shook as he cried out. I wanted so badly to help them. But how could I? If I did, I'd end up dead.
The sheriff picked up a baseball bat and beat his wife repeatedly. Finally, he stopped moving. I could feel tears rolling down my cheeks. How could he do this? Why would he hurt such a beautiful woman? Tears streamed down my face as I floated closer to the ground. Soon, I was falling through space. A bright light appeared ahead. I reached out towards it as I felt my life slipping away. That's when I realized that I wasn't dying; I was being reborn.
My new life is far better than what I ever could've imagined. I live in a big house with many rooms. Each of them are filled with different people. Some are demons while others are angels. I can choose which ones I want to spend my time with. It's been almost five years since I was born. In that time, I've learned that not everyone is good. There are some who seek to take advantage of those who need them most. There are also those who are evil enough to kill their own family members without a second thought. Yet, I am lucky because I have the power to protect them. I am blessed enough to have a family that cares about me.
They say that the devil never sleeps. But I know he does. And he has plans to destroy everything that is good in this world. I hope someday I'll be strong enough to stop him once and for all. Until then, I'll continue protecting those who cannot fight for themselves. I'll continue fighting the battle of good versus evil. I'll keep trying to save lives even though sometimes it feels hopeless. For that reason alone, I believe that God sent me to this earth for a purpose. Whether it be to bring happiness or sadness, I don't really care. So long as I can make a difference, I'll stay on Earth and fight to the bitter end.

325,R_1jvLUFeGocTmgVD,OUR_HR_10,Historical Romance,Ouroboros,Panel,"The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He knew immediately that she wasn't local; that her hair was too red-gold for the place. But it didn't matter; no one had ever given him a moment's pause before. She did then.
His first thought was, What an ugly woman! But she'd just been staring at him with an expression of complete incomprehension on her face, as if he was a particularly interesting insect. It hadn't been so much her face, though—she certainly didn't have pretty features. It was all about her eyes. They were so green and bright, they seemed to shine right out at him from behind her thick lashes. Even at close range, the light caught them in a way that made him think of emeralds, and there was something almost glowing about the color. He knew she had a figure that would make any man stand up and take notice, and even at the time, he thought he'd seen some expensive clothes under the plain brown traveling cloak she wore over her shoulders. Yet when he looked down at the table and tried to smile at her, all he could manage was a clumsy attempt at politeness. All his thoughts went to the image of her eyes, those green eyes, staring at him and trying to understand.
He watched as she left the tavern without a word, still trying to convince himself that what he'd just seen had been an illusion brought on by drinking too much wine. That was his first impression of her; the impression that stayed with him was not so flattering.
At the end of that day, he'd gone into a pub in the square. His job was serving drinks and meals, but that evening, he had been lucky enough to be given a small room in the back where he could sleep and lock the door if need be. He'd spent most of the day drinking and listening to the others around him talk, and he was feeling mellow when he came out into the square. A few people were going on about how beautiful she had looked; it seemed to be their main topic of conversation. But he ignored them. They weren't real, they didn't matter. He would never see her again anyway.
The next morning, though, when he woke up after sleeping fitfully and found himself alone, he remembered seeing the woman in the inn. It wasn't like he'd ever really forgotten her; she was always with him. He'd just convinced himself that he didn't really see her after all, because it made no sense to have such vivid memories of a stranger. Even now, he felt the strange pull he'd experienced the night before, as if he'd suddenly become part of something more than himself, and the memories came back with a suddenness that almost took his breath away. She had been so close, he'd thought he could reach out and touch her, but then she was gone.
He had looked everywhere for her, wandering from village to village, stopping by every tavern, hoping to find some sign of her. Then he gave up, thinking that if she'd meant to stay in those towns, they wouldn't have been there for long. And yet she kept returning to that one place, and as each day went by, he knew he was getting closer to finding her. It had taken him over two months of traveling around to get to the city where he now sat, and he didn't think he could have done anything else. He couldn't stop himself; he had to know if what he'd seen was real, or just another figment of his imagination.
Now that he was here, though, he was still far from sure that the woman was real. He'd followed the river for two days, and at last the water had led him up through a rocky canyon to this fortress. He could just barely make out the lights from inside the walls, even though the sun had set hours ago. Now that he was here, he wondered if he should go back and wait in the town until tomorrow night. The road to the fortress was well-traveled; it would be easy enough to follow.
He glanced down at the pile of gold coins he held in his hand, thinking that perhaps this wasn't such a bad idea. After all, it would certainly solve his immediate problem, and he didn't really have any other option. But that didn't mean that he wouldn't regret it later on, he thought. There were more important things than money; they were all around him right now, standing there on the trail in front of the fortress, but he was only looking at the gold.
His thoughts turned back to her eyes again, and he felt his resolve weakening. This fortress belonged to the Order of Saint Nicholas, who had taken her captive; maybe they were trying to keep her from seeing him. It wouldn't matter; she didn't have the eyes to see him. He knew that as well as he knew anything; he had looked into them when he'd seen her in the inn. It was the only reason he could ever have had to follow her so far from home.
Even so, he was torn. The gold could be useful. He thought about turning back now and letting her be safe, and then maybe he could find a way to free her. Maybe that was what he should do, instead of running out on her like some coward.
He stood there for a long time, gazing up at the fortress and thinking about the decision he would have to make. Finally he reached out and pushed open the door to the stable beside the gate. Inside, two horses were tied together by their bridles, and a man was standing by with an axe. ""Is the horse ready?"" asked the man without looking at him. He seemed very interested in the axe, and the man smiled as he held it up for the stranger to see. It was an ordinary-looking ax, not very sharp; it would serve well enough to get his job done.
""Yes,"" said the stranger, and handed over a small sack of coins. The man took them without a word and went to work. A few minutes later, he came back and gave him the ax, along with the reins. ""There you are. Be careful.""
""Thank you,"" said the stranger, and turned to leave.
The man called after him. ""Where are you going in such a hurry?""
""To deliver this horse,"" answered the stranger. He wasn't lying; he didn't know why the man wanted to know.
""What is your name?"" the man called, and then, when the other didn't answer, he said, ""Come back here! I want to see you!""
The stranger paused, but decided there was nothing to gain from further conversation. He pulled the reins from the man's hand, and said, ""My name is Gerhardt von Zittau. Now if you'll excuse me—"" He started to turn away again, then stopped. Something in the man's voice made him hesitate. ""I'm sorry,"" he said, ""but what is your name?""
""You don't need to know that,"" said the other man, and he walked over to his horse and got on, still smiling.",1253,-0.8316513488890739,-0.715781494290157,0.10817643655823937,-0.31555865640886666,-0.5644792749157422
