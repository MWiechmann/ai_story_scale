      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The air felt warm against my face as I walked down the street toward the presidential palace.\n",
      "The streets were empty except for a few people going about their daily business. I saw one old woman pushing a cart filled with vegetables, another man carrying two large bags of grain across his shoulders, and a young couple holding hands while they walked past me. As I passed them, I could see the girl looking up at me curiously. She had dark brown skin like mine but wore a white dress with purple trim. Her hair was braided tightly around her head, and she looked familiar somehow...\n",
      "A flash of memory came back to me then. When I'd first arrived on Mars, I'd been taken to a small village where I met a girl just like her. We had talked together for hours until we finally went our separate ways. But what had happened between us? Had she left me or did I leave her? And why hadn't I thought about her since then?\n",
      "My thoughts drifted away from the girl as I neared the palace. I didn't want to think about her anymore. Instead, I focused on the meeting I would be having later today with President Fisk. He wanted to discuss the possibility of establishing a permanent colony on Mars. At first, I'd been excited by the idea, but now I wasn't so sure. My mind kept returning to the girl from my memories. What if she really was important to me? If I agreed to help build a new colony on Mars, how long would I have to stay there before I could return home again? Would I even want to go back after all these years?\n",
      "As I approached the entrance to the palace, I noticed something odd. A large group of men wearing black uniforms were gathered outside the gates, talking among themselves. They seemed to be waiting for someone, but no one else was around. Curious, I stopped and watched them for a moment. One of them turned to look at me, and I recognized him immediately.\n",
      "It was General Stearn!\n",
      "I couldn't believe he was here. How had he found me? Why was he here? I stood there staring at him for several seconds before I realized that I should probably say something. So I cleared my throat nervously and called out, \"General?\"\n",
      "He turned around quickly and smiled when he saw me. \"Hello, Mr. Smith,\" he replied. \"What are you doing here?\"\n",
      "\"Dr. Sato told me that the president wants to talk to me,\" I answered.\n",
      "Stearn nodded. \"That's right. Come with me. We'll get you inside.\"\n",
      "We started walking toward the front gate, and I asked, \"How did you find me?\"\n",
      "\"I've been following your progress ever since you landed on Mars,\" he explained. \"I'm impressed by everything you're accomplishing here. You must be very proud of yourself.\"\n",
      "I laughed. \"Well, I am. I guess I never really thought about it before, but I do feel pretty good about myself. I mean, I'm not exactly like other people. Not everyone can spend five hundred years on Mars without aging a bit!\"\n",
      "Stearn chuckled. \"Yes, I suppose you're right. But don't worry too much about it. Everyone ages differently on Mars anyway. Some of us age faster than others. Yours is just a little slower.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, yeah? Well, I still haven't aged a day in all this time, and I don't plan on starting anytime soon!\"\n",
      "\"Okay, okay,\" said Stearn. \"Let's drop the whole 'aging' thing. It doesn't matter. All that matters is that you're here. Now, let's get inside.\"\n",
      "Once we reached the gates, Stearn opened them for me. Inside, a soldier escorted me through the halls of the palace and into the president's office. I saw Dr. Sato sitting at a desk near the door, along with several other scientists and engineers who worked for the government. They all looked up as I entered and gave me polite smiles. I waved to them and sat down in the chair next to the president.\n",
      "President Fisk looked tired and worried. His dark hair was thinning, and his face was wrinkled like an old man's. He had a long scar running across his forehead, which made him look more intimidating than he actually was. The general leaned forward and said, \"Mr. Smith, I have some bad news for you.\"\n",
      "\"What kind of bad news?\" I asked.\n",
      "Fisk sighed and said, \"There's been a terrorist attack on Earth. Several nuclear bombs have been detonated, and most of the population has been wiped out. There are only a few survivors, and they're all hiding underground somewhere. We've lost contact with the rest of the world.\"\n",
      "\"What?!\" I gasped. \"But how could this happen? Who could possibly do such a thing?\"\n",
      "\"We don't know yet,\" answered the general. \"All we know is that it was done by someone who knew how to use the technology we developed for our colony on Mars. Whoever it was, they managed to sneak onto Earth undetected and set off the nukes before anyone could stop them.\"\n",
      "\"So, what does this mean for us?\" I asked. \"Are we safe here on Mars?\"\n",
      "\"No, unfortunately not,\" replied the president. \"This means that we need to start preparing for the worst. I've already sent a message to the UN, and they're sending a team of scientists over to investigate the situation. Once they figure out who did it, we'll be ready to move on them and put an end to their evil plans once and for all.\"\n",
      "\"Wait a minute,\" I interrupted. \"You said you'd sent a message to the UN? But I thought we weren't allowed to communicate with Earth anymore.\"\n",
      "The president frowned and shook his head. \"Not directly, no. But we can send messages to the UN through the Mars colony. That's how we got word of the attack in the first place. I figured we might as well take advantage of the fact that we're connected to Earth.\"\n",
      "\"And what will the UN do?\" I asked.\n",
      "Fisk shrugged. \"They won't be able to do anything until the investigation is complete. But I'm sure they'll come up with something. They always do.\"\n",
      "The president turned to me and asked, \"Do you have any ideas about how we should respond to this threat? Do you think we should prepare for war?\"\n",
      "\"War?\" I repeated. \"With whom? I don't understand.\"\n",
      "\"I'm sorry, Mr. Smith,\" said the president. \n",

      "\n",

      "Actual story was:\n",
      "The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. The tavern wasn't busy yet—the weather was still warm enough for people to be outside on their balconies and in the streets—but it wouldn't take long before the place would be crowded. He was already running behind and would have to stay late to finish all his work.\n",
      "He'd been thinking about how much he didn't want to stay late. It meant missing dinner with his family. And then the girl had entered the tavern, and she hadn't been there for a meal or drink. Her face was so familiar that even though he couldn't remember seeing her before, he knew exactly who she was.\n",
      "She was the daughter of one of his father's friends. She was also the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.\n",
      "His mother had taught him what to look for in a woman, and he knew exactly when to step back from the table and let someone else sit there. When he did, she looked around and saw him watching her, and she smiled. The smile lit up her whole face. He was certain she would have winked at him if she could.\n",
      "He tried not to stare, but he couldn't help himself. He watched her every day for the rest of that summer, as she walked through the market, went down to the docks, and stood in front of the tavern window while she waited for her father to come home from work. He thought about going over to speak with her, but he knew he should wait until her father wasn't there. He'd heard how he treated women.\n",
      "He kept telling himself that he would ask her out soon enough. But time passed, and he didn't ask. The next year, she was gone, and he never saw her again.\n",
      "That was the summer that he realized what his father meant by saying that you shouldn't fall in love too quickly. Love was like an ocean wave: it crashed into your heart and took hold of it. There was no getting away from it once it had touched you.\n",
      "\"I'm sorry,\" he said, as he reached the door. \"My father's not home.\"\n",
      "The girl smiled and nodded. She was still smiling as she turned and walked out of the room.\n",
      "\"You'll need to see my father about this,\" the girl said, as she stepped outside.\n",
      "\"What are you talking about?\" asked the boy, who was now a man.\n",
      "The girl laughed. \"You've been here all afternoon, and I haven't seen him once. What are you doing here? Do you live in this building?\"\n",
      "The man shook his head. \"No, but he is my father.\"\n",
      "\"Oh!\" The girl frowned and then shrugged. \"Well, if you want to talk to him, you'll need to do it in the morning. He leaves very early, so he can make it back home before dark.\"\n",
      "\"He's going to be angry with me.\"\n",
      "\"Don't worry about it. Just go home.\"\n",
      "\"Thanks. Good night.\"\n",
      "The boy turned to leave and then stopped when the girl called out to him.\n",
      "\"Wait. You forgot your money.\"\n",
      "He looked down at the table where the coins had been. They were gone. He hadn't taken them, but they must have slipped off the table somehow. He reached out and picked up the money and put it into his pocket.\n",
      "\"Good night,\" he said.\n",
      "As he left the room, he thought about how much he wanted to stay. But he knew that his father would be angry with him for staying late. So instead of returning to work, he walked down the hall to the front door, where he found a young boy standing there. The boy was holding the key to the apartment next door.\n",
      "\"My name is Omer,\" he said. \"Do you know where I might find Mr. Zebedee?\"\n",
      "The man smiled and nodded. \"You're lucky. He's not home yet, so you won't get in trouble.\"\n",
      "The boy's eyes lit up as he realized what that meant. \"Thank you!\" he said. Then he ran down the stairs and across the street.\n",
      "The man watched him go, then locked the front door and went back into the tavern. He took out his keys and unlocked the door to his father's office, which was on the first floor. He stepped inside and shut the door behind him, then sat down in his father's chair. He leaned forward and placed his elbows on the desk and rested his forehead in his hands. He closed his eyes and tried to think of something other than what had just happened, but no matter how hard he tried, all he could see was her face.\n",
      "She was beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, and it hung in long curls around her shoulders. She was tall and slender, with a small waist and wide hips. When she laughed, he thought her eyes sparkled like two blue jewels. And when he looked at her, he couldn't help but smile.\n",
      "He wondered if she still lived in the building. He didn't remember seeing any children in the neighborhood who looked like her. Maybe they were from one of the neighboring villages. Or maybe she was someone's daughter, but they weren't married yet. That would explain why she hadn't come home with her father.\n",
      "The longer he thought about it, the more excited he became. He knew he needed to speak to his father in the morning before he left for work. He would find out everything there was to know about her. He hoped she would be there waiting for him.\n",
      "And then, as if she had heard his thoughts, she appeared in the doorway. He couldn't believe it. His heart jumped up into his throat. He couldn't even speak. He stood up and took a step toward her, and she smiled at him. He felt himself falling into her eyes, and he wondered if he'd ever been this happy in his life.\n",
      "He wanted to say something to her, but he didn't know what to say. So instead, he held out a handful of coins.\n",
      "\"I need to see my father,\" he said, \"but I have this money.\"\n",
      "She reached out and took the coins from his hand. Then she put them in her pocket.\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" he said, as he stepped closer to her.\n",
      "She nodded and turned to go. Before she got out of the room, she looked back over her shoulder at him.\n",
      "\"Good luck,\" she said.\n",
      "He smiled. She smiled. It was enough for him.\n",
      "It wasn't long after that he met her father. Her father was a tall, thin man who wore a beard and mustache that made him look like a pirate. He also had a long, bushy mustache. His hair was dark brown and pulled into a ponytail. \n",

      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...someone waking up in a spaceship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. Today, however, would be shorter than usual because of the eclipse, which was due to happen later today. The next time we'd have a full solar eclipse on Mars, it would be in two years. I got into the aircar, which I'd driven to work all of one other time since moving here. There was a line of cars parked along the road waiting to take people across the crater to their homes or offices. I recognized some of the faces—some were crew who lived here, and others were students like me who had been recruited by the government. When you moved to Mars, they sent you an aircar. It was a lot cheaper than flying yourself, though it was still expensive.\n",
      "The car picked up speed as soon as I hit the throttle and started toward the city center. We drove over a small ridge and down toward the edge of the crater where I could see a series of craters with the famous white dome of Olympus Mons rising above them. Some of the craters had little houses around them, but most were empty. Many of the residents lived inside the crater in domes that were far bigger than the ones that housed us here on the surface. A few domes were occupied by families, while others held various government agencies and scientific research facilities. I'd never understood why there wasn't a city built underground to save energy and protect against radiation. If a big rock came crashing down from space, the city would probably be crushed by the force of the impact.\n",
      "We turned south and flew over a patch of dark brown sand before circling around to the east where I could see a cluster of buildings on a low hill. It was my house. It was smaller than I had expected, which I thought was strange because of the fact that it sat right next to one of the largest lakes on Mars. The lake itself was the size of a large pond in Michigan, and the house was on a small island in the middle of it. The water looked calm, but I knew that there were dozens of different kinds of dangerous things living in the lake, such as leeches, poisonous jellyfish, and various fish. When I got home, I'd need to do a full inspection of the house to make sure that the various windows and doors were still intact, and that all of the solar panels were functioning properly. I hadn't been here in months, so I didn't really know what to expect.\n",
      "The aircar slowed down as we approached the house. I looked out the window at my father standing by the side of the house as he waited for me. He smiled when he saw me looking, but then his face fell, and a look of sadness came over his face. A man that I assumed to be my father's new wife walked toward him and gave him a hug, and I could tell from her body language that she was happy to see him. I got out of the car, and my dad gave me a small wave before walking toward the house. The woman was standing at the front door, and as soon as she saw me, she turned around and started running back down the hill. My heart sank.\n",
      "I looked back to see my mother sitting on the front steps of the house. She stood up when she saw me and waved. I smiled and waved back. There was no reason to be sad, though. This was probably going to be my new family. My new life on Mars. I hoped that they wouldn't keep me locked away like some kind of prisoner. I just wanted to live my life without any hassle.\n",
      "We walked into the house together, and the woman followed us inside. \"Hi, I'm Ann. It's nice to meet you,\" the woman said to me. \"We have some food if you'd like to eat.\"\n",
      "\"I appreciate it,\" I said.\n",
      "\"So, this is your son?\" she asked my father.\n",
      "\"Yes, he's going to stay here with us,\" my father replied. I had already heard the story of how I was discovered, but I still didn't understand how a little kid like me ended up here on Mars.\n",
      "My mother went upstairs while Ann took me into the kitchen where there were several different things that I could smell. It smelled like pork and potatoes. \"It's lunchtime, so let me get your plate ready. You're hungry, aren't you?\" she said, opening up one of the cupboards. She pulled out a bag of potato chips and put them on the counter. \"What do you like to eat, Yuri?\"\n",
      "\"I love pizza,\" I replied.\n",
      "\"That sounds perfect!\" she said, getting some plates and silverware out of another cabinet. I watched as she put on some kind of sauce, which she then used to coat the top of a big piece of bread. Then she placed slices of meat in the center and topped it off with cheese before placing the whole thing on a baking sheet. When she was done, she put it into the oven and set the timer.\n",
      "\"Do you like sports? I can take you to watch a basketball game later if you want.\" She handed me two slices of pizza, which were both warm by the time we got outside again. \"How about I call a taxi and have him drop us off at the stadium?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, please,\" I replied.\n",
      "She took a seat next to me on the grass outside as I ate. Ann smiled as we chatted. \"How is school?\" she asked. \"Are you excited to start your program?\"\n",
      "\"I think I'm going to like it here,\" I replied. \"Maybe even more than Earth.\"\n",
      "\"That's good,\" she said. \"I hope you get along with your classmates.\"\n",
      "\"I'm not really sure yet,\" I admitted. \"There are only six of us in my class, so it's going to be hard to get to know them.\"\n",
      "\"Well, you'll definitely make friends once you've been here a while. You're very cute, so you should have no problem,\" Ann said with a smile. I couldn't help but blush as she spoke, and I had the urge to reach up and touch my hair. It was just so long.\n",
      "After lunch, Ann asked me if I wanted to come with her to do some shopping in town. We hopped into the car and started driving east.\n",
      "\"Do you have a boyfriend?\" she asked.\n",
      "\"Not that I know of,\" I replied.\n",
      "\"You don't date much?\"\n",
      "\"I guess not,\" I said, thinking back to high school. I hadn't dated a lot. There was one boy that I liked, but he didn't go to my school. He'd gotten in trouble for cheating on tests, which I thought was ridiculous. The only reason I was interested in him at all was because I had a crush on his older brother. But it turned out that I wasn't supposed to know who his brothers were. That's why the teachers let him leave school early to hang out with me after class. I never learned who his real family was, and neither did he. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...someone working in a tavern. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. I had a long drive ahead of me, but as always, I enjoyed the time alone in the car. There were so many things I wanted to ask Sato about her recent visit to Earth, but she was being cagey and hadn't given me much information. The only thing I knew for sure is that there were no aliens involved in this meeting.\n",
      "I drove up to the presidential estate in the center of Mars City, where I parked next to a dozen other vehicles in the parking lot. After walking through the security checkpoint, I went inside the main entrance where several people were waiting. One looked familiar, but after a few more moments of staring I realized it was Dr. Sato who greeted me warmly. She led me through another set of doors and down some stairs that would lead us outside to a large courtyard surrounded by buildings. A couple of soldiers stood guard at one end, scanning everyone who entered. They wore armor, carried rifles, and kept their eyes locked on each person passing by them. I had never seen such militarized guards before. The president must be very serious about keeping this place secure, I thought as we walked across the courtyard towards a set of glass double doors. We stopped when we reached the doorway and waited until two men carrying briefcases came out first. One was wearing the standard suit of clothes, while the other wore a full lab coat and had glasses hanging around his neck. He also held a briefcase in one hand. Sato introduced them both as Mr. O'Malley and Professor Kuznetsov. When they saw me, Professor Kuznetsov smiled broadly. \"You are even more impressive than your file claimed,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Thank you,\" I replied. He was tall with graying hair, and seemed to have the kindest eyes. As I studied him a bit closer, I noticed his skin was quite white compared to everyone else in the room. It was also covered with a thick layer of red patches and blotches that resembled the red dust from Mars. Even so, he still didn't look any different than I did, except perhaps healthier. His face was smooth, and his hands had no wrinkles or age spots. I wondered if I could have the same sort of longevity treatment when I grew old.\n",
      "We continued walking past the security guards and through another set of double doors until we reached a large oval-shaped conference table sitting in the middle of the room. Sitting across from me were President Anderson and Dr. Sato. I sat down next to Professor Kuznetsov, who offered me a smile before turning back to President Anderson.\n",
      "\"Please, be seated,\" President Anderson told me as he pulled out the chair next to him.\n",
      "As we began talking, I found out Dr. Sato was actually a woman named Yuki Sato. Apparently she was born on Earth and had spent most of her life working in labs there. She was an expert on human cloning—which I found surprising since I didn't think anyone else even knew it was possible. She started telling me how she met Professor Kuznetsov on Earth and they worked together to perfect the technology needed to clone a human body. Then, using the same process, they created artificial bodies that could survive in Martian conditions and function just like normal humans. The first one was made for President Anderson himself.\n",
      "\"What about this?\" asked Dr. Sato, pointing to the red patch on my arm that was visible beneath my shirt sleeve. I looked down and saw that it appeared to have gotten bigger during our discussion.\n",
      "\"It doesn't concern us,\" answered President Anderson. \"If your skin color has anything to do with this then you're welcome to stay here as long as you wish.\" He paused, looking at me for a moment. \"So what exactly are you here for?\"\n",
      "\"I was hoping to find out where your people have come from,\" I replied. \"How they got to Mars and why they want to destroy all of humanity.\"\n",
      "Dr. Sato interrupted with a raised hand. \"We already know that, but I don't see how we can help you,\" she said.\n",
      "President Anderson smiled and nodded. \"Well, Dr. Sato, I'm afraid this young man is right. We know very little about how these aliens arrived here or where they came from.\" He looked over at me, and then turned back to Dr. Sato. \"I suppose if they were willing to give up all their secrets, you would probably want them to stay here with us forever,\" he added.\n",
      "\"No, sir, I wouldn't,\" I replied with a sigh.\n",
      "\"Then let me explain something to you,\" said President Anderson, leaning forward in his chair and speaking in a low voice. \"This isn't the first alien attack we've suffered. It seems as though they are targeting only certain countries that seem important somehow to our society. We know the Chinese attacked us a few years ago. Our government wasn't prepared, but fortunately the aliens couldn't figure out how to get through their military defenses. However, there have been attacks against our neighbors to the south.\"\n",
      "The president's words surprised me. The Mexican president? I wondered if they were related somehow to Dr. Sato. Maybe they were all connected. Or maybe they weren't even the same people at all, but some other species living in Mexico. If that was true, then perhaps I really was dealing with a new species of alien that was able to communicate with humans and manipulate their minds.\n",
      "\"That doesn't make sense,\" I said, shaking my head slowly. \"Why haven't they attacked us again? Why aren't they attacking the US directly?\"\n",
      "\"Maybe we have something they want,\" suggested Professor Kuznetsov from next to me. \"Maybe that's why they haven't destroyed us completely. They want us to surrender or die.\"\n",
      "I shook my head and stared back at President Anderson. \"You're lying.\"\n",
      "\"Are you sure?\" he asked. \"Do you have any proof of what you claim?\"\n",
      "I sighed again and looked away from him. \"You won't believe me if I tell you anyway. You're going to say it's all in my head.\"\n",
      "\"All right,\" he replied, standing up from the table and putting his arms behind his back. \"Let us prove to you that this isn't all in your head, young man.\" He turned to Professor Kuznetsov. \"Please ask him to leave this room while we prepare some samples for testing.\"\n",
      "Professor Kuznetsov nodded and got up from his chair, leaving us alone in the conference room. The president followed him out of the room, closing the door behind him, and turned around to face me again. \"I have no idea what you are talking about, but if you are saying these creatures have some connection with us, then it must be true.\" He walked towards the windows overlooking the courtyard to one side of the room before stopping near a large cabinet against the wall. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...someone working in a tavern. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. That didn't make the temperature any better as it climbed above a hundred degrees Fahrenheit outside. I started walking toward the main plaza, where our embassy was located. A few more steps down the road, I could see the three giant pyramids standing proud and tall in the distance. They were surrounded by white sand dunes, but in the center, there was a large green park where people went to relax in the shade of the palm trees. On the other side of the park was one of the buildings that housed our embassy, our scientific research facility, and our cultural center. We were also responsible for administering Mars' many cities and towns, so it made sense to have an office right next to the embassy. I was thankful my apartment wasn't in the capital, which meant I only had to go out when necessary.\n",
      "The day after landing on Mars was always rough. For one, there's no way to sleep well at night when you know your bed is still two thousand miles away. For another, all the sensory information from the planet, coupled with the lack of any familiar sights or sounds, makes it tough to get comfortable enough to sleep. You're constantly bombarded with noises and visuals you never would've imagined possible on another planet. The gravity of Mars feels like you're being punched in the stomach. And then there's the heat, which was already up to a hundred and twenty-five degrees outside today. That didn't even take into account the dry air, which made breathing a chore and gave me a sore throat.\n",
      "The embassy building itself was quite small compared to the pyramid buildings and other large structures around it. There were only a handful of scientists working here, and that number was shrinking every year. With the economy in flux and Earth's space program facing budget cuts, many people left to find jobs elsewhere on the planet or on other planets in the Solar System. Most of them came back though, especially once they saw just how much work needed to be done in order to make Mars habitable for humans. I would have stayed on Earth if I could, but since that wasn't an option, this seemed like my best chance.\n",
      "I made it inside and made my way to the president's office, where I found him sitting behind his desk. \"What's up?\" he asked as I took a seat across from him. His hairline was receding a bit and his eyes had a bit more gray than the last time we talked, but otherwise he looked pretty much the same. He was also wearing his blue dress uniform instead of his usual Hawaiian shirt, which was a good sign. That meant everything was going according to plan, so far.\n",
      "\"It's about the meteorite,\" I told him. \"The samples you asked us to take back to Earth were successfully collected.\" I showed him the data chip he'd sent me and inserted it into his computer.\n",
      "\"Good work,\" he said. \"That's exactly what we wanted you to find out. So what happened with the other samples?\"\n",
      "\"Well, all the data I gathered was analyzed by my team and deemed not significant enough to bring back. It wasn't anything dangerous—just some rocks we found on the surface of the meteorite that we weren't expecting.\" I showed him the report and gave a brief overview of my findings. The president didn't seem surprised. He simply nodded his approval at the end of it. \"And your crew?\" he asked after I finished reading the final page. \"Are they back to normal yet?\"\n",
      "\"They're fine. They actually were a lot better than the others. They're still tired from being on Mars, but the rest of their symptoms have subsided. I'll be sending them home in a couple weeks. It'll take that long for them to recover fully.\"\n",
      "\"Very well,\" he said. \"We need to figure out where we go next. If we stay here, we're only going to keep digging ourselves deeper into debt.\" He picked up the phone, which was lying on his desk. \"Get me Dr. Sato.\"\n",
      "She came in a few seconds later and gave him a report of her own. \"There are a couple things we want to get started on right away,\" she said. \"First, I'm going to be taking control of our research center and moving it out to one of the abandoned cities that used to house our crews. There will be more people there, so we can do some field work and research that can help us improve our chances of surviving on Mars. Also, if we need to move to a different planet, it's good to have a backup plan.\"\n",
      "\"And the second thing?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"It's a big project that won't be done in a couple days. We need to build an artificial greenhouse to grow plants here on Mars. Not just any plants, either. The ones we find growing on the meteorite. With some genetic engineering, we might be able to replicate the growth patterns of plants from Earth and recreate the food chain that used to exist. I think we could easily create a self-sustaining ecosystem here with that in place.\"\n",
      "\"That sounds good to me,\" the president said. \"I think we should start on it as soon as possible.\"\n",
      "The room was quiet for a minute before I spoke again. \"Sir, if you don't mind my asking, what is this really about? You know I'm not really the military type.\"\n",
      "\"Don't worry,\" he said. \"It has nothing to do with the military. That was all a cover to give us a reason to come out here. What I want you to do isn't something we can pull off without your help.\"\n",
      "\"So what is it?\" I asked. \"What can I do to help?\"\n",
      "\"As I said, it's not exactly something you can do. You're going to have to build a spaceship, and you'll be the first person to go through hyperspace.\"\n",
      "\"I don't understand. Are we talking about one of those old ships like you used in the war?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"No, it's more than that,\" he said. \"But it'll still be a smaller craft compared to what you're imagining.\"\n",
      "\"Oh,\" I said. \"Do you mean an interstellar ship?\"\n",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"You'll need to create a propulsion system that will take you to a nearby star system, where you'll then find another ship waiting to take you to the next one.\"\n",
      "\"Are you sure this isn't just some crazy conspiracy theory?\"\n",
      "He laughed. \"I wish it was. It would've been easier.\" He put his phone down and looked over at me. \"There are people who think there's life on other planets—at least one planet, anyway. And if that's true, we have no way to know if it's dangerous or not. They could be planning to invade, as you might say. We have to send a message out to warn them. So we need a spaceship to do that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...someone waking up in a spaceship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. This is why most Martian settlements are located near their equator, where there is more light all year round than in almost any other place in the world. The solar panels on my roof were even able to produce enough energy to power my air conditioner in the middle of summer.\n",
      "As someone working at one of the largest scientific companies in human history, I'm sure that makes me sound pretty spoiled. But it's true: as far as our race has come, most people back on Earth still live without access to electricity or running water. Most don't even know what it means to not have enough food for their families. It was those who had nothing but a dream of reaching the stars that first took us beyond our old home planet, and it is those same people—many of them living in poverty and misery today—who will be the ones working toward the next frontier.\n",
      "The president's office was the kind of thing you would expect from a large corporation: large, with high ceilings and walls of glass overlooking a garden. There was a small reception area where a secretary offered me a seat and took my name and ID number. When she returned, she informed me that the president was ready to see me. She escorted me down a hallway lined with portraits of past presidents and eventually stopped outside of the large double doors leading to the main area.\n",
      "\"Mr. Mokri?\" a deep voice asked. I turned and saw a middle-aged man standing in the doorway. He was wearing a dark gray suit, white shirt, and red tie. His hands were folded behind his back, and he wore a warm smile on his face.\n",
      "\"Yes,\" I replied, stepping forward and offering him my hand. He clasped it firmly as we shook. \"It's nice to finally meet you, Mr. President.\"\n",
      "\"Please, Tomohiro, just call me John.\"\n",
      "We both smiled as I led him into the room. I introduced him to Dr. Sato. Once everyone was settled, I pulled over two chairs for us so that we could all be comfortable.\n",
      "\"First of all, thank you for taking the time to meet with me,\" I began. \"You must have been extremely busy lately to be able to set aside some private time for me.\"\n",
      "John nodded and folded his hands together as if in prayer.\n",
      "\"Of course, Tomohiro,\" he said. \"Your work is important to us, and we want to make sure that you're taken care of. We are proud to have someone of your caliber working for us.\"\n",
      "\"But I need to ask you about that,\" I replied quickly. \"Because when I look at this company, I don't see you hiring the greatest minds from around the world. Instead, I see a lot of Japanese employees.\"\n",
      "The president frowned but let out a deep sigh.\n",
      "\"It pains me to see that you're right, Tomohiro. As much as I'd like to deny it, I think that's true for most large corporations. In an age dominated by globalization, our country has fallen further and further behind. But I also see the opportunity to change that. If we can show that we're willing to take on international talent, we may have a chance to pull ourselves up. Our company, as well as the rest of the nation, will benefit.\"\n",
      "I wasn't completely convinced.\n",
      "\"You don't seem to understand how difficult this is. There is prejudice against foreigners on Earth, and it's hard to convince anyone to leave everything they know to come to a cold and desolate place like Mars.\"\n",
      "\"I understand,\" the president replied. \"That's the reason I asked you to come here. The problem is that many of our workers are afraid to try anything new. They're comfortable where they are, and moving them away from their homes doesn't seem to make sense for them. I want you to help convince them that this is what is best for all of humanity. If we don't, we'll never be able to advance.\"\n",
      "He paused for a moment.\n",
      "\"Are you really willing to do this? Because this is going to be incredibly difficult.\"\n",
      "I thought for a moment before responding.\n",
      "\"I guess my only question is whether you're willing to let me start right away.\"\n",
      "The president smiled warmly.\n",
      "\"We've already put in a request to the Board of Directors, and I think it will go through. We're in a unique position where no one's expecting us to succeed. If we fall apart, it won't cause any real problems for the company. So I'm sure they'll be happy to give us the green light for your project.\"\n",
      "\"Great. Then I'm ready to go.\"\n",
      "\"Excellent,\" John replied. \"I'm glad we finally got to sit down and talk. I think I can confidently say that you are exactly the person I wanted to find.\"\n",
      "\"Really?\" I asked. \"That's quite a bold statement. I'm not sure I deserve such high praise.\"\n",
      "\"Don't worry about that,\" John said. \"All I care about is that you are the kind of person who will go above and beyond to bring about change, even at your own expense. If we can work together towards that goal, then I am confident that we'll see great results.\"\n",
      "After I left the president's office, I walked across the lobby to the elevator. Just before the doors closed, I heard another voice echo down the corridor.\n",
      "\"Hey, Tomohiro! Wait up!\"\n",
      "It was Dr. Okubo. I turned and raised my eyebrows as she hurried over to me. She looked exhausted.\n",
      "\"What's wrong?\" I asked her. \"I saw you looking like something was bothering you on your way in.\"\n",
      "She sighed deeply, and I noticed that she was trembling. Maybe it was the temperature in the building. She held onto the railing for support as the elevator rose to the top floor.\n",
      "\"It's nothing serious,\" she told me. \"It's just, I've been assigned to a new project, and I don't know if I'm going to be able to keep up with the pace anymore.\"\n",
      "This was news to me, and I was surprised by her reaction.\n",
      "\"Why do you say that?\" I asked. \"From what I hear, your team has done great work in the past.\"\n",
      "Dr. Okubo gave me a confused look, almost as if she didn't believe me.\n",
      "\"That's just what they tell you so you'll stay,\" she said, shaking her head. \"I've actually been working on a new experiment on the fourth level of Level Four. It's a brand-new technology that uses the heat produced by the fusion reactor to drive nanobots in a way that should allow them to do many different things. We're using it to try to increase the efficiency of the power grid in our facilities.\"\n",
      "\"And it's not going well?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"Not at all,\" she replied. \"In fact, it's getting worse. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...a noise coming from a mirror. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. A beautiful creature in black leather and red silk, with an air of mystery about her. He didn't know why she caught his eye as he served drinks to customers, but when her eyes met his... well, he could only stare, mouth agape for several seconds before he could think clearly again and make himself get back to work. But it was too late; she'd seen him looking at her, and now he had no idea what to do next.\n",
      "She wasn't wearing a sword—that much he knew for certain—so he didn't feel any danger from her at that moment. Yet, as soon as he got away from the bar area to go back on service duty, someone tried to mug him. Luckily, two of his friends were nearby at their table, and they took care of it quickly enough. He never asked who they were, even though they'd told him, simply because he liked not knowing anything about them. They made sure the man got away without killing or hurting anyone—except for the mugger—and left him lying half-dead in the street after giving him a few more bruises than needed. Then they went off to have fun elsewhere.\n",
      "He couldn't forget how she looked as she walked by. Not just once either; several times she passed him, and each time it was different. The first time there was such fire in her eyes he thought she might start shooting him out of hand for looking at her. The second time she looked down at the ground, almost hiding her face. The third time she smiled at him, although briefly. And then she turned to walk away. By the fourth time she passed by his table, she was smiling at him again.\n",
      "\"I don't think so,\" she said, when he finally managed to say something to her. \"You're not my type.\" Her voice was low and throaty, yet sweet and gentle at the same time. He couldn't remember having heard anything more beautiful in his life.\n",
      "\"Why's that?\" he asked, feeling like a fool even as he spoke. How could he ask her that, when she obviously wanted nothing to do with him? And why would she tell him anyway, if all he had going for him was a nice smile?\n",
      "\"Well, I've never been interested in men who work in taverns. Especially ones who look like you do.\"\n",
      "That stung, but not too badly. \"So what do you want?\" he asked, trying hard to sound like he hadn't taken offense at her words. Or maybe it was his looks she didn't like? He certainly wasn't ugly or anything; he'd had a lot of admirers over the years. But none of them came close to her. \"Maybe some of your fancy dresses?\" he joked, trying to lighten the mood between them. \"Or perhaps jewelry, to keep you safe and warm through the cold winter months?\"\n",
      "Her laughter filled the room, and she reached out and touched his chin lightly, making him grin. \"Oh, you can keep your jewels to yourself, mister! I wouldn't take them off unless I absolutely had to.\"\n",
      "\"And how are we going to know when that happens?\" he asked.\n",
      "She laughed again, shaking her head at him while still looking down at the table top in front of him. \"I'm not telling you anything,\" she finally said, then stood up.\n",
      "He felt so stupid. What had he expected her to say? That he was the most handsome man she'd ever seen, and she'd be happy to give him whatever he wanted from her? Of course not, silly! She probably wanted to get rid of him. No wonder she hadn't wanted to talk to him earlier; she didn't know him at all, after all. He'd been a bit of a flirt, asking her questions that were completely unnecessary, and she'd gotten tired of his attitude and decided to ignore him. So, what did she mean, he couldn't take off her clothes? If she didn't want to see him anymore, she should just tell him.\n",
      "Instead, she'd made him feel like a total idiot. He'd thought maybe she could help him find what he was looking for—a wife, to raise a family with and live happily ever after—but now he wasn't even sure that was possible. After all, it was obvious she didn't want to see him again, not really. She'd just said so. Now he wished he could call off his search altogether, because it seemed to be useless. He would never find anyone like this woman; there was no chance she'd marry someone like him.\n",
      "\"Hey,\" he called out, when she'd walked past him on her way out of the tavern.\n",
      "\"What?\" she replied, but she stopped walking and turned back toward him.\n",
      "\"Don't go just yet!\" he cried, realizing what a fool he must have looked like pleading with her like that. \"I'm sorry I bothered you.\" He started backing away, hoping she didn't notice how pathetic he sounded.\n",
      "\"Oh, I don't mind talking to you,\" she replied, sounding amused. \"But you're a little young for me, and not very good looking, either.\"\n",
      "His heart sank. \"I'm sorry I wasted your time,\" he muttered miserably.\n",
      "\"No need to apologize,\" she said softly. \"I actually enjoy being around you.\"\n",
      "He stared at her in shock. \"How did you know that?\"\n",
      "\"Because I can tell,\" she replied. \"And you haven't bothered me since you apologized, so let's leave it at that.\" With that she turned around and walked out of the tavern, leaving him staring after her in utter disbelief. What was happening here? Had she changed her mind about wanting to avoid him, or was he imagining things? Either way, the idea that she might like him made his heart soar in joy. He couldn't believe it was real; it had to be a dream. But it seemed to be more than a dream...\n",
      "\"Hello?\" A female voice cut through his thoughts as he sat at the bar again, waiting for customers to order drinks. When he looked up, he found the beautiful woman standing in front of his table, looking down at him.\n",
      "\"Hi there,\" he said shyly, unable to take his eyes from hers. \"I hope I'm not bothering you. You just surprised me by showing up like that.\"\n",
      "\"I thought you looked familiar,\" she replied, leaning forward slightly toward him. \"I think we talked to each other last week. But I don't remember your name.\"\n",
      "He shook his head. \"Not that it matters. My friends call me Dovian.\"\n",
      "\"Dovian?\" She frowned for a moment, but then smiled. \"That's a strange name, if you don't mind me saying so.\"\n",
      "\"It means 'dream' in a foreign language,\" he explained, smiling back at her. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...someone working in a tavern. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't my own; it had an old man's features. The eyes were sunken in its wrinkled skin, and it was wearing a white robe with a hood pulled over his head.\n",
      "\"Who are you?\" I asked. \"What do you want?\"\n",
      "The face didn't answer right away. Instead, he just stared at me for what seemed like forever before finally speaking.\n",
      "\"You're going to die,\" he said.\n",
      "It was then that I realized this was no dream. This was real life, and someone was standing behind me watching me sleep. I turned around quickly, but the person was gone. I looked down at myself, but everything was fine. There was nothing wrong with me. My arms and legs felt normal. Then I remembered the voice I'd heard earlier. I went back to the mirror and saw the same thing staring back at me.\n",
      "\"Why did you say that?\" I asked him. \"Do you know something about me? What is your name?\"\n",
      "Again, he didn't respond right away. He just stood there silently as if he couldn't move or speak. After a while, he started moving again and spoke.\n",
      "\"My name is Death.\"\n",
      "Death? That's not really a name. It sounds more like a title than anything else.\n",
      "\"Well, why don't you tell me who you are instead?\" I asked. \"If you're going to be telling me I'm going to die, shouldn't we get to know each other first?\"\n",
      "He didn't respond right away, so I waited patiently. Finally, he answered.\n",
      "\"I am Death,\" he said. \"And you will die tonight.\"\n",
      "Then he disappeared. I turned around to see where he went, but he was nowhere to be seen. I shrugged my shoulders and headed back to bed. Maybe he was just some kind of hallucination brought on by the painkillers I'd taken. But when I closed my eyes, I could still feel him staring at me through the mirror.\n",
      "I woke up to another knock on the glass. I opened my eyes and sat straight up in bed. I looked over at the clock beside my bed. It read 5:30 AM. I looked back at the mirror and saw the same old man standing behind me.\n",
      "\"Is this a joke?\" I asked. \"Are you trying to scare me? If so, it isn't working.\"\n",
      "He didn't respond right away. Instead, he just kept staring at me. His face was expressionless. I decided to try and talk to him again.\n",
      "\"Look, I'm sorry,\" I said. \"But I don't have time for your games. You can go now.\"\n",
      "That's when he moved. He stepped forward and grabbed hold of my neck. Before I knew it, he was choking me. I tried to fight back, but I couldn't even breathe. I reached out for the lamp next to my bed, but I missed. As soon as I let go, he released me. I fell to the floor gasping for air. I looked up and saw him standing over me.\n",
      "\"Now, I'm going to kill you,\" he said.\n",
      "Before I could react, he punched me in the stomach. I doubled over, and all I could do was gasp for breath. He grabbed hold of my throat again and squeezed until I passed out.\n",
      "When I awoke, I was lying on the ground. I looked up and saw the same old man standing over me.\n",
      "\"Hello, David,\" he said. \"I've been waiting for you.\"\n",
      "I wanted to ask him how he knew my name, but I was too weak to get up. All I could do was stare up at him.\n",
      "\"You're going to die tonight,\" he repeated.\n",
      "I nodded my head. I couldn't speak. I was too tired.\n",
      "\"Good,\" he said. \"Because you're mine now.\"\n",
      "Then he disappeared.\n",
      "I woke up the next morning feeling refreshed. I looked over at the clock beside my bed. It read 7:00 AM. I hadn't slept long enough to feel rested, but I felt better than I had in days. I got up and went to take a shower. I needed to wash off the blood and dirt that covered my body. I took a quick look at my reflection in the mirror. I didn't recognize myself. My face was pale and gaunt. I looked like I'd aged ten years since yesterday.\n",
      "I finished getting dressed and headed downstairs to make breakfast. When I walked into the kitchen, my mom was sitting at the table drinking coffee. She looked up at me and smiled.\n",
      "\"How are you feeling today?\" she asked.\n",
      "I shrugged my shoulders and sat down across from her.\n",
      "\"I think I'll live,\" I said. \"Where's dad?\"\n",
      "She shook her head.\n",
      "\"He hasn't gotten up yet,\" she replied. \"He's been sleeping in the living room ever since you came home last night. Do you remember anything?\"\n",
      "I looked down at the table.\n",
      "\"No,\" I said. \"I don't remember anything.\"\n",
      "\"Maybe you should call Dr. Greenfield,\" she suggested.\n",
      "I nodded my head and dialed the number. After a few rings, he picked up.\n",
      "\"Dr. Greenfield, this is David,\" I said. \"I need to talk to you about something.\"\n",
      "He sighed and put down the phone.\n",
      "\"David?\" he said. \"What happened to you?\"\n",
      "I told him everything that had happened. When I was done, he was silent for several seconds.\n",
      "\"I see,\" he said. \"Well, I guess we'd best get you to the hospital then.\"\n",
      "\"Wait, what?\" I asked. \"Why?\"\n",
      "\"Don't worry about that right now,\" he said. \"Just come over here and let me examine you.\"\n",
      "I hung up the phone and headed back upstairs. I packed my things and waited for my mom to come home from work. When she arrived, I helped her carry my father to the car. We drove to the hospital and checked him in. They ran some tests, and they found nothing wrong with him. A couple hours later, the doctor called us into his office.\n",
      "\"I'm afraid your father has suffered a severe stroke,\" he said. \"We're going to run some more tests, but I'm pretty sure he won't make it through the night.\"\n",
      "My mother started crying. I held her hand and wiped away the tears that were streaming down her cheeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...the description of a small village. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He hadn't recognized her at first, not until she spoke to the man beside her. Then it all came back to him-the day she had saved his life. The same day he'd lost hers.\n",
      "Now she was here again, in the village where he lived, the very village that he hated because she had lived there, too. It made no sense. She must have moved away after the fire burned their family home, after he'd left to find work in another town. He would have remembered if she had stayed behind. But now she was back and he couldn't escape the thought that everything had led up to this moment.\n",
      "This woman had ruined the rest of his life. Why should he care that she had returned? It would only make matters worse, as though the fire and the loss of his family had not been bad enough. Still . . . she was beautiful.\n",
      "She looked much younger than he remembered, but she still had a kind of innocence about her eyes. They were large and blue and framed by thick dark lashes. Her skin was flawless, pale almost white, as though she never ventured out in the sun. Her hair was as black as night, the strands twisted up off her head so that only her face was visible, but it fell down over one shoulder and brushed her breastbone. Her dress was simple brown, long enough to touch the ground. There was nothing in it to attract attention, but then, why would she need to attract anyone's attention? She'd never be able to marry anyone in the village because everyone knew what she'd done.\n",
      "And yet, even knowing all that, she was still very attractive. How could he have let her go? And now he wouldn't be able to stop thinking about her; he would always see her when he closed his eyes. And in his dreams, he would have her again and feel that terrible pain she had caused.\n",
      "It was the wrong sort of woman for him. She was too innocent, too trusting. The way he felt today—he would never be able to keep himself from using her and then leaving her when he got what he wanted. It went against his nature, but that didn't mean he could control it.\n",
      "\"I'm sorry I kept you waiting,\" she said, coming around the table and dropping into the chair next to him. \"You're sitting on my knee. My name is Isabella.\"\n",
      "He was surprised; she hadn't given him time to reply before she started talking.\n",
      "He looked at her in surprise. \"Your knee?\" His own voice sounded flat, empty of passion. How could he feel anything toward this woman? He was a rake and she was a saint.\n",
      "There was a note of challenge in her voice. \"What do you mean?\"\n",
      "He shook his head. How could she possibly want him? What she did was wrong. Wasn't it, though? Everyone else seemed to think so. But he wasn't going to argue. He was a rake, and he had been raked.\n",
      "Isabella smiled. \"I'm sorry if I've offended your sense of propriety. It's just that I don't want you to think I'm trying to seduce you, or any such thing. I don't want to frighten you.\"\n",
      "\"Why would you do something like that?\" he asked. He had to know. She was too intriguing a creature for him not to want to hear her story. He was still young and strong and virile. Why shouldn't he enjoy a little diversion before he married someone proper and settled down to raise children?\n",
      "Her brow furrowed. \"That's what you're wondering, isn't it? That's why I asked you to meet me here. I thought you might ask that question. It's important that I answer it.\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sure I understand.\"\n",
      "She smiled a bit shyly. \"When you asked to see me, it wasn't so much out of desire, although that helped, I suppose. I didn't plan this when I first met you.\"\n",
      "\"You planned on seducing me?\" He laughed, but there was nothing funny about his laughter. It was just a release, to get rid of the pain.\n",
      "\"I didn't plan on having my hand burned.\"\n",
      "\"But you still came to see me.\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"Why?\"\n",
      "\"I don't know,\" she admitted.\n",
      "He shrugged. If she'd had her hand burned because of him, what did that matter? It wasn't as though she would remember anything once he left her.\n",
      "\"I wanted you to tell the village that I'm not a witch.\" She spoke almost hesitantly, as though afraid he would somehow know who she was.\n",
      "\"So that's what it was all about?\"\n",
      "She nodded.\n",
      "He looked at her and suddenly realized how strange their relationship had been up to this point. There had been an attraction between them the first time he'd seen her, before she saved his life. They seemed to have some sort of understanding, as if they'd known each other from somewhere before this, but neither of them had spoken a word to the other until the night of the bonfire.\n",
      "They had never actually shared a conversation. He couldn't remember what she had looked like and she couldn't remember how he had looked. There had been a bond between them, though, an intangible something that was there whenever they were together. Now it was broken.\n",
      "\"All right. Tell them whatever you want.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you.\" She seemed embarrassed.\n",
      "He looked around. This wasn't a place to talk. There were too many people here, listening to every word. \"Let me buy you a drink,\" he suggested. \"We'll talk more privately later on.\"\n",
      "She smiled. \"That would be wonderful.\"\n",
      "They stepped into the bar and ordered drinks. They were served by two girls who were serving beer and ale to some customers. As they waited for their drinks, the girl with the empty pitcher leaned over the counter.\n",
      "\"Hey, Isabella,\" she called to her. \"Did you know there's a big snake in your garden?\"\n",
      "Isabella laughed, as though it was funny. \"I'm not sure. Do we have a snake in our garden?\"\n",
      "\"Yeah. It's huge, bigger than a wolf. It's been in the yard for three days now. You better check on it.\"\n",
      "Isabella laughed again. \"That's funny. Thanks for the warning, though. Maybe you should tell Mr. Jenkins about it.\"\n",
      "The girl looked confused. \"What do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"Mr. Jenkins lives right next door to you.\" Isabella smiled at the girl. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...the description of a small village. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. My boss had told me he would be waiting for me when I arrived so I headed down the street toward the big white dome where the government offices were located.\n",
      "The walk was nice; it made me feel like I could breathe again after being cooped up in my tiny apartment all morning. The air was crisp and clean outside, and the sky was clear blue as far as the eye could see. In most places on Earth, people couldn't even see that much because of all the pollution. But not here—Mars was almost completely free from any traces of biological contaminants or toxins.\n",
      "There were still some areas, though, where there wasn't enough oxygen to support life. Places such as the polar caps, which made up nearly half of the planet's total surface area and covered more than three quarters of its land mass. These cold and inhospitable regions were off limits to humans—no one lived there. Not anymore, anyway.\n",
      "But then, how long ago did people live there? Only about forty years ago, right? It wasn't long after that that humanity first set foot on Mars and began colonizing the planet. They'd built cities, farms, and factories—establishing a thriving community within just a few short decades. We found water in abundance beneath the soil, and soon the population exploded from hundreds to millions overnight. There were no more wars, and everyone seemed content to live together in peace.\n",
      "That is, until the incident.\n",
      "It happened four years ago, and has been referred to as the \"Great Mistake.\" No one knew what exactly caused the catastrophe, but the city of New Tokyo was destroyed in an instant by what appeared to be a massive solar flare. Every single person on the planet vanished without a trace. All our technology stopped working, too. Communication was impossible, and we had no way of knowing if anyone was alive anymore. Some scientists believed it was a natural occurrence that had somehow gotten out of control, while others thought it might have been caused by an alien invasion.\n",
      "In either case, the world was plunged back into the dark ages, and we lost everything.\n",
      "Then, several months later, we discovered that they were alive. It turned out that the vast majority of us had simply teleported away from Earth when the disaster struck. A fleet of ships left the planet with hundreds of thousands of people aboard them. The ships were programmed to go straight for Mars, and they arrived less than one week after the disappearance. That's when the real trouble started.\n",
      "We learned that the people who had left behind were not happy about being abandoned, and many of them were willing to do anything in their power to get back home. The situation quickly devolved into chaos as the humans on Mars fought among themselves for food and supplies. Eventually, the United Nations stepped in to quell the violence, and took control of the Martian colony.\n",
      "It wasn't long before the UN realized that the problem wasn't going to go away. If we were to ever become a truly independent nation, we needed to build a secure border between our new home and Earth. This was the main reason why we didn't allow anyone else to settle on Mars, and why we only allowed refugees to come here in small numbers. It was also the reason why I joined the military instead of continuing my studies at MIT.\n",
      "As I approached the dome and entered through the front doors, I felt the familiar rush of excitement that I always got when entering the grounds of the government building. The lobby was bustling with activity as workers hurried around, trying to make sure everything was ready for the president's arrival. They all looked frantic, and I guessed it was because the meeting was supposed to take place within the next hour.\n",
      "After checking in and giving them my ID, I walked down the corridor toward the elevator and found myself in the middle of a group of soldiers who were standing around talking. Most of them wore matching black uniforms and had a similar look about them, but that wasn't the only thing they had in common. I recognized one of the men from my training sessions last week. He was a big guy, standing tall and confident with broad shoulders. As I drew closer, I saw that his eyes were dark and piercing, and that he had a scar running along his jawline.\n",
      "\"Hey, Mike! What are you doing here?\" I asked.\n",
      "He gave me a big grin. \"Just checking out what the other guys look like. You know, to make sure I'm not the only one wearing camo pants.\"\n",
      "His words made me laugh. \"You're definitely not alone there. Everyone seems to love those things.\"\n",
      "Mike shook his head. \"Yeah, well, looks like we're all gonna have to suffer together. At least it's better than the old fatigues. Still, these will probably change eventually, too. It's hard to say what they'll do next.\"\n",
      "I nodded. \"True. It's funny, I never really thought about it before, but you're right. Technology has changed so much since the first colonists came here. The first computers weren't even invented yet, and now we have smart phones that can access the internet from anywhere on the planet.\"\n",
      "Mike shook his head. \"Smart phone? What's that?\"\n",
      "I laughed and slapped him on the shoulder. \"Whoa, sorry man. I forgot that you grew up in the Stone Age.\"\n",
      "He grinned. \"Don't worry about it. I hear that your generation is going to be pretty different from ours. They've already done some amazing stuff, like inventing the teleportation device.\"\n",
      "I smiled. \"Really? That's awesome!\"\n",
      "\"And they're even talking about cloning, and creating artificial intelligence.\"\n",
      "My eyes widened. \"Wow...that sounds like something out of a science fiction movie.\"\n",
      "\"Well, it is, but that's not the worst part,\" Mike added.\n",
      "A chill ran down my spine. I was pretty sure I knew what he was getting at. \"Oh yeah?\"\n",
      "\"They're already planning to terraform Earth, too. Apparently, we're going to try to make the planet more like Mars so that we can live there someday.\"\n",
      "The elevator dinged, and we both stepped inside. Once the doors closed, Mike continued. \"Can you believe that?\"\n",
      "I thought for a moment before answering. \"It's true, isn't it?\"\n",
      "\"Yeah, I guess so. I mean, it makes sense. Look at it this way, Earth has lots of resources that we don't need, and we have plenty of room here on Mars. Why not try to turn it into a second home for us?\"\n",
      "He had a point. I'd heard the same thing from a few other people, too. I didn't want to sound pessimistic, but it did seem strange that we would try to recreate the conditions on Earth when there was a perfectly good home here on Mars in the first place.\n",
      "We reached the top floor and exited the elevator, then started walking toward the president's office. As we walked past the reception desk, two women sat there talking quietly. One of the ladies noticed us and waved. \n",

      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...the description of a small village. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "\"I have a message for you from the president,\" said Dr. Sato, handing over an envelope to me. \"He's asking that we meet with him at his office this afternoon.\" I took it and thanked her before walking out of my apartment building into the bright sun. It was already noon on Mars—the longest day in the year here on the planet. The sun shone down like a golden orb, lighting up the blue-green clouds. They were low enough to see now that the spring had finally arrived. I looked back at my apartment, which was situated at the very top of one of the tallest buildings in downtown Athens. There wasn't much to look at there besides my place and the other three units on the floor, but I'd lived there since my arrival two years ago and felt comfortable. I turned to go down the stairs when a sudden thought hit me.\n",
      "\"Sato! What do you mean the president wants us to meet with him? Is he going to tell us something new about this mission?\" I asked as soon as I reached the ground floor.\n",
      "She gave me a confused look. \"The president doesn't want to tell you anything. He wants you to be surprised.\"\n",
      "\"That's not very reassuring,\" I replied. \"And what does he think is going to surprise us?\"\n",
      "\"You'll see. Just make sure you're there on time.\" She headed back toward her car.\n",
      "I made my way through the crowds on the streets to the parking garage where my rover was parked. It was still early for the rush hour traffic, so it wasn't too hard to get out of the garage and onto the road. The rover took off smoothly as soon as I started driving, heading east toward the city center. The roads were wide here on Mars, and there was no need for lane markers or traffic lights. Instead, there were large yellow lines painted down the middle of each road, separating the lanes into sections. I drove at a steady pace, keeping an eye on the road ahead and scanning the sky. I didn't have to look far to spot the first signs of spring—a flock of birds flying in a V formation, and a single bright red flower growing on the side of a small hill. As I approached the city center, I saw the government buildings on the left, and then the massive white dome of the UN building on the right. The sun glittered off its curved surface, which reflected the light of the midday sun. It was a sight that never failed to impress me.\n",
      "\"Welcome to Athens,\" I said as I pulled into the parking garage of the government complex. The guards recognized me and waved me through, letting me into a secured parking area reserved for government officials. A security officer came over to check my ID. He scanned it and handed it back before waving me inside. I parked and walked across the foyer to the main reception area. It was a large open space with tall glass windows looking out into the city. A couple of people were sitting behind the counter, and they stood up as I approached. One of them was Sato, who greeted me with a warm smile.\n",
      "\"Hello, Takahashi-san,\" she said. \"Are you ready?\"\n",
      "I nodded as I looked around. \"As always,\" I replied.\n",
      "She led me past the waiting room and down a long hallway. At the end of the hallway was a door, which was closed. We stopped outside and waited until a woman dressed in a dark blue suit opened it. She looked at us before nodding to Sato and walking away. Sato turned to me.\n",
      "\"We'll be leaving from the president's office,\" she said.\n",
      "\"So, he doesn't want to talk to me?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"He wants to talk to everyone,\" she answered. \"You're one of his most trusted advisors.\"\n",
      "The woman led us into an elevator and up to the top floor, where the president's office was located. As soon as we stepped off, she led us to a private meeting room and left us alone. We sat down and looked around. There were two men standing by the window, looking out at the city. They smiled when they saw Sato enter the room. I followed her gaze and saw the president sitting on a leather chair behind the desk, flanked by two women in business suits. The president waved to us before turning his attention back to the window. He was tall and wore a black suit. His skin was dark, like mine, but there was something different about him—a hint of a beard and a pair of thick glasses resting on his nose. It took me a second to recognize that this was the man who had been elected to be president of the UN.\n",
      "\"Takahashi-san, please take a seat,\" he said.\n",
      "Sato and I sat down, and the two men moved to stand behind us. They placed their hands on our shoulders as if we were children being shown to their seats for the first time. The president walked over to a table in the middle of the room and poured himself a glass of water before taking a seat. He sat down with his feet stretched out in front of him and smiled at us.\n",
      "\"Thank you for coming, Takahashi-san,\" he said. \"I know how busy you are, so I appreciate you taking the time to meet with us.\"\n",
      "I nodded. \"Of course, Mr. President. It's an honor to have been asked to come here today. I hope I can help.\"\n",
      "\"As do I,\" he replied. He took a sip from his glass and looked at Sato. \"Please tell me what you want me to know.\"\n",
      "Sato gave me a curious glance before starting to speak. She told him everything that had happened since the last time we'd spoken. About the incident with the Chinese ships and the discovery of the alien artifacts, as well as the recent discovery of a new artifact deep beneath the ice on Pluto. By the time she finished, I could see the president's face was dark with worry.\n",
      "\"So, this is all connected?\" he asked. \"All these incidents? They're related somehow?\"\n",
      "Sato nodded. \"It's possible they're all connected, yes.\"\n",
      "The president leaned back in his chair and rubbed his forehead. \"I've got some bad news for you, Takahashi-san,\" he said.\n",
      "\"What's that?\" I asked.\n",
      "\"Your mission will not be ending when it's supposed to.\"\n",
      "I looked at him in surprise. \"How can you say that?\" I asked. \"We've already completed all our objectives! We found the alien artifacts, and we returned to Earth without a single problem. We even came back ahead of schedule!\"\n",
      "\"But that wasn't the point of your mission, was it?\" he answered. \"You were sent out to find evidence of extraterrestrial life, and that's exactly what you did.\"\n",
      "I shook my head. \"That's not what we were tasked to do. You said yourself that there's nothing in the reports that says we need to bring back any samples or data. We just have to come back.\"\n",
      "He took another sip of water and looked at me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...the description of a small village. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "The first time he saw her, the sight of her was like a slap across his face. She'd come into the tavern where he worked and sat at one of the tables in front of him. He couldn't help but stare as she ate from the bowl that had been placed on the table before her. It wasn't just because she looked so beautiful—though she did, with long black hair and eyes that were green enough to make him think of spring leaves. No, it was more than that; there was something about her that made him want to know everything about her. But when he finally got up the nerve to ask if she wanted anything else, she turned away and left without saying a word.\n",
      "He hadn't seen her since then, though he often thought about her. And now here she was again, sitting at another table in the same tavern, this time eating alone. She seemed different somehow, though he couldn't say exactly what it was. The way she carried herself, perhaps? Or maybe it was how she held herself, as if she were afraid someone would see her. That was why he kept his distance, watching from afar.\n",
      "She finished her meal quickly and rose to leave. As soon as she stood up, he hurried over to her table. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"I'm sorry I didn't get your name.\"\n",
      "\"It's not important,\" she replied curtly.\n",
      "\"Well, if you don't mind my asking...?\"\n",
      "Her expression softened slightly. \"My name is Aella,\" she told him. Her voice was soft and sweet, and he could tell right away that she was a woman who knew how to use it.\n",
      "\"Aella,\" he repeated. \"That's an unusual name.\"\n",
      "\"Not really,\" she said. \"There are many people named Aella in the city, including myself.\"\n",
      "\"How interesting,\" he murmured. Then he leaned forward and whispered, \"If you're ever in need of a friend, you can always count on me. I'll be happy to talk with you anytime.\"\n",
      "She smiled at him and nodded. \"Thank you for your kind offer, but I have no need for friends. My life has been very lonely, after all.\"\n",
      "He felt terrible. What must she be going through? How sad! He wanted to take her by the hand and lead her out of the tavern, but he resisted the urge. Instead, he took her arm gently in his own and led her outside.\n",
      "\"You seem troubled,\" he remarked. \"Would you like some company until you feel better?\"\n",
      "She looked at him curiously. \"Why would you do such a thing?\"\n",
      "\"Because I want to,\" he answered simply.\n",
      "\"But why?\" she asked. \"What good will it do?\"\n",
      "\"Perhaps nothing. Perhaps a great deal,\" he replied. \"I'm just trying to show you that you aren't alone anymore.\"\n",
      "She stared at him for a moment, then smiled and said, \"Thank you. You've helped me a lot today.\"\n",
      "As they walked down the street together, she suddenly stopped in front of a shop window. There was something inside that caught her attention. \"Look!\" she exclaimed excitedly. \"Isn't this pretty?\"\n",
      "He followed her gaze and saw a pair of earrings in the display case. They were silver and shaped like flowers. \"Yes, they are,\" he agreed. \"They look lovely on you.\"\n",
      "\"Oh, thank you!\" she gushed. \"This is my birthday present from my mother. I haven't even had a chance to wear them yet.\"\n",
      "\"Then let me give you mine instead,\" he said. \"After all, I already have two pairs of earrings, and I rarely wear either of them. This way, you can have both.\"\n",
      "\"Really?\" she asked, looking pleased.\n",
      "\"Of course. Now, shall we go back to the tavern?\"\n",
      "\"Good idea,\" she replied.\n",
      "Back at the tavern, she put on the earrings, and he admired their beauty. \"These are gorgeous,\" he said. \"Wherever did you find them?\"\n",
      "\"At this shop,\" she replied. \"Do you know it?\"\n",
      "\"No, I don't,\" he admitted.\n",
      "\"It's called 'The Flower Shop,' and it's located near the market square. I think you'd enjoy visiting it sometime.\"\n",
      "\"I'd love to,\" he said. \"Maybe next week, if you're free.\"\n",
      "\"Great! I'll meet you there.\"\n",
      "And so, every day after work, he went to the flower shop with her. Sometimes they talked about the weather or the latest news in the city. Other times they simply enjoyed each other's company.\n",
      "One evening, she mentioned that her birthday was coming up. \"Have you decided what you're going to get for your gift?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"No, I haven't,\" she confessed. \"But I know what I want. I want a man who loves me.\"\n",
      "\"I can't promise you that,\" he told her. \"But I can try to help you find him.\"\n",
      "\"You mean you'll introduce us?\" she asked eagerly.\n",
      "\"Yes, I suppose I will,\" he replied. \"If he seems like someone you might like, I'll bring him to the tavern one night. If you approve, I'll ask him to join our little group.\"\n",
      "\"That sounds wonderful!\" she exclaimed. \"Will you do that for me?\"\n",
      "\"Of course,\" he assured her. \"Now, what should I call him? Do you have any suggestions?\"\n",
      "\"His name is Cade,\" she said. \"Cade, this is Aella.\"\n",
      "\"Pleased to meet you,\" he replied.\n",
      "\"Likewise,\" she responded. \"I hope you'll come visit me again soon.\"\n",
      "\"I will,\" he promised. \"In fact, I'll see you tomorrow night.\"\n",
      "When she left, he sat at the table for a while, thinking. He hadn't expected things to turn out quite this way, but he liked it very much indeed.\n",
      "He returned to the tavern and found his friends gathered around the table. \"Did you hear the news?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"What news?\" asked one of them.\n",
      "\"Aella and Cade are getting married!\"\n",
      "\"Who's marrying whom?\" asked another.\n",
      "\"Don't you know?\" asked the first. \"They're engaged!\"\n",
      "\"Engaged?\" gasped the second. \"Are you sure?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I'm sure!\" he answered. \"Aella told me herself.\"\n",
      "\"So, when's the wedding?\" the third asked.\n",
      "\"Tomorrow afternoon,\" he replied. \"She wants to celebrate tonight.\"\n",
      "Everyone cheered. \"We'll have to throw her a party!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...with a message from the president. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "The sun was high in the sky when they arrived at their destination. The valley of the River Tethys flowed into a wide, shallow lake surrounded by mountains on all sides. A small village sat along its shores with two towers standing guard over it from either side like sentinels. It looked to be deserted but for some smoke rising up out of chimneys and the occasional bird flying overhead or flitting through trees.\n",
      "\"Well this looks suspicious enough,\" said Grumph. He had his hand on his sword, which he hadn't even drawn yet.\n",
      "\"It does look quite peaceful,\" agreed Dirk. \"There are no bodies lying about though.\"\n",
      "\"Maybe they all got away in time. The trouble is, we're not exactly dressed for the occasion. We need to find out what happened here before we can do anything else.\"\n",
      "\"Agreed,\" said Rufus. \"I'll see if I can sneak up to one of the towers and take a peek inside.\"\n",
      "The wyvern was already on its way. As soon as Rufus left sight, Dirk took a deep breath.\n",
      "\"Okay, everyone stay here. This is going to get rough, so just hang tight for a few moments. When the time comes, you will need to keep low and try to remain unseen. If anyone sees us, the mission's failed and we have no choice but to flee.\"\n",
      "Dirk and Rufus ducked down behind a row of trees as soon as they were close enough. The trees grew thick there, and a good hiding place.\n",
      "Rufus paused only briefly, long enough to peer over the lip of the tower. His nose twitched as he spotted a couple of horses tied up nearby, but that wasn't what made him stop. It was a man lying near the edge of the building, sprawled out face-up in front of the window with a bloody knife sticking out of his back.\n",
      "A young girl wearing a stained white dress knelt beside the corpse, her eyes wide with horror.\n",
      "Rufus felt something tugging at his chest, some sense of familiarity he couldn't quite place. The girl glanced up as she heard his approach, her brown eyes huge and frightened. He recognized those eyes now, although he still didn't know where from.\n",
      "\"Hello,\" Rufus said as he stopped. \"Don't be alarmed, I mean you no harm.\"\n",
      "Her expression softened, and she dropped the knife in her hand before taking a step away from the body. Rufus wanted to make sure she knew that she had nothing to fear from him.\n",
      "\"I'm Rufus. Are you all right?\"\n",
      "He put a comforting hand on her shoulder and looked into her eyes again.\n",
      "\"It's okay. No one is going to hurt you.\"\n",
      "She nodded but kept staring at him with wide eyes. It was odd for a little kid her age to look so much like a terrified rabbit, but it wasn't the strangest thing Rufus had seen this day.\n",
      "\"Do you know who killed him?\"\n",
      "The girl shook her head.\n",
      "\"My name is Fay,\" she said after a moment. \"My father called me Faye. Father always told me not to go outside alone, but he went with them to market and left us behind. Now he's dead!\"\n",
      "She covered her mouth as she began to cry, but Rufus quickly held her arms down and waited until she regained control.\n",
      "\"Is there anyone else in the village? Are you sure there's no one else hurt?\"\n",
      "Fay nodded. She wiped at her eyes and sniffled. \"No. I don't think so. I saw only that man. Everyone else is gone. We never thought to lock the doors or leave a guard behind.\"\n",
      "Rufus stood and turned to look back at the building. It wasn't possible to see inside, but it didn't seem as though anyone was waiting around. He walked up to the body and studied it.\n",
      "\"Whoever killed him seems to be long gone, but we have to find out why he did it. I suppose you'll need to come along if we're going to find out anything.\"\n",
      "Faye nodded again.\n",
      "\"I would be grateful to you,\" she said. \"You can't imagine what my life has been like lately.\"\n",
      "Rufus couldn't even begin to guess. She looked far too young for something like this, and he could tell by her eyes that she had seen more than her fair share of horrible things.\n",
      "He pulled the dagger from the corpse's back, then quickly scanned the ground. The killer hadn't been fast enough to get very far, so he should have no problem tracking them down.\n",
      "\"Let's get out of here and start looking,\" he said, herding the girl down the path toward the village. \"We may not find anything, but at least we might learn something useful.\"\n",
      "Fay glanced over her shoulder nervously once as they went, but Rufus didn't pay it much mind. At the very least, he hoped to be able to show Faye that there was still good in the world. If nothing else, maybe she wouldn't be afraid of him anymore.\n",
      "They continued to make their way down the path until they arrived at a clearing. A wooden house sat in the center, surrounded by gardens with large pots full of plants. Rufus spotted two people walking towards them, both dressed in dirty clothing.\n",
      "The man wore a stained gray tunic and a leather belt across his chest. His hair was long and greasy, and the top of his head was covered by a thick growth of dirt. His companion appeared to be wearing some sort of cloak made out of animal hide. She carried an empty basket over her arm and wore an expression of confusion as she turned to look back at the village.\n",
      "Rufus knew the man before he even saw his face. He was the local priest and had been leading prayers in the village square every evening for some time now.\n",
      "\"Father!\" cried Rufus as he ran up to him, the little girl following close behind. \"Thank goodness you're all right!\"\n",
      "\"I'm sorry to interrupt,\" the man said as he looked down at the dead body. \"But I have no idea how we can continue to perform our prayers when this sort of thing is happening.\"\n",
      "\"No one has any idea,\" said Rufus, trying to sound soothing. \"Now please, let's get inside so we can discuss what happened.\"\n",
      "The priest nodded.\n",
      "\"Come on, then, let's go find your daughter and see if she needs help.\"\n",
      "Fay followed along silently, clutching Rufus's hand. The priest and Dirk both kept looking at her in surprise. It was clear to Rufus that they were thinking she was a little girl who was far too young to be helping with such important business. He wasn't sure why the priest looked so shocked though.\n",
      "Rufus glanced down at the girl once more. She was standing there, looking at the corpse and shaking, but he couldn't blame her for being afraid. She had been through a lot lately, and Rufus felt a twinge of guilt knowing that she had seen things she shouldn't have.\n",
      "\"Where's your mother?\" he asked Fay as they entered the house. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Participant said this story began with...\n",
      "...with a message from the president. \n",
      "\n",
      "Actual story was:\n",
      "I woke up to hear knocking on glass. At first, I thought it was the window until I heard it come from the mirror again. I got out of bed and walked over to the mirror. When I looked into it, there was a face looking back at me. It wasn't mine or anyone I knew. The face was pale with long dark hair. A single tear fell down her cheek. \"Who are you?\" I asked. She didn't answer so I asked again, but she still didn't respond.\n",
      "\"What do you want? Why can't you talk?\" I asked. Her mouth opened and she started to scream.\n",
      "A loud crash came from downstairs. My heart stopped beating when I heard my name being called. \"Bethany!\" I ran to the door and turned the knob. As soon as I did, I felt a sharp pain in my chest. I collapsed onto the floor and blacked out.\n",
      "When I awoke, I was laying on top of an old oak desk. I sat up slowly, afraid that if I moved too quickly, I might pass out again. After several minutes, I finally stood up. I put my hand against the desk and found a piece of paper. I picked it up and read the words written there.\n",
      " Dear Bethany,\n",
      " If you're reading this, then either you've already gone crazy like I have, or you haven't yet. Either way, you'll never be normal again after seeing what I'm about to show you. This is your last warning. Don't open the door! If you don't listen to me, you will die. Your life is worth more than any amount of money. Please keep yourself safe and remember who's watching over you. You know who I am, but only by my voice. You mustn't tell anyone else what I have shown you. Not even your mother. Do not look behind you. There is something evil waiting for you there. I wish you luck.\n",
      " Love,\n",
      " Mama\n",
      "There were no names signed beneath the message, just Mama's handwriting. I stared at the letter for several minutes before realizing I needed to get out of there. I had to leave before I saw anything else. I grabbed the door handle and pushed, but it wouldn't budge. I tried pushing harder, but nothing happened.\n",
      "\"Why won't you let me go?!\" I yelled, slamming my hands against the mirror.\n",
      "The glass shattered with a loud crack. Shards flew everywhere, cutting my arms and legs. I screamed, falling backward and landing on my stomach. Blood dripped from the wounds on my legs.\n",
      "I rolled over and saw a figure standing right above me. It took me a second to recognize it, but when I did, my heart skipped a beat. It was Mama. But she wasn't my mother anymore. All the color left her skin; instead, she was covered in blood. It oozed from every wound on her body. The stench made me gag. Her eyes were wide open, staring blankly into space. They reminded me of those dead fish I'd seen floating in the water once. Her teeth were stained red, showing where they'd been gnawed on.\n",
      "She smiled, revealing her bloody gums. \"Come closer,\" she said, her voice coming out as a raspy whisper. \"It's time we met.\"\n",
      "My breath caught in my throat and I couldn't move. How could someone be alive without their soul? That's impossible!\n",
      "Her lips pulled back from her teeth and she bared them at me. \"Do you see now why you need to stay away?\" she hissed.\n",
      "I shook my head frantically, backing away from her. \"No...no, I don't understand. What are you talking about?\"\n",
      "\"You cannot escape,\" she said, reaching out to grab me. \"This is all you deserve.\"\n",
      "I ran, stumbling through the hallway, tripping over broken pieces of glass. I kept running until I reached the front door. I threw it open and slammed it shut.\n",
      "I ran around the house, searching for a car, but it was nowhere to be found. Then, I remembered Mama always drove a white Mercedes. I looked around the driveway, but didn't see one. I glanced inside the garage and spotted it. It was parked under a blue tarp, hiding the damage. I pulled the tarp off and climbed inside. The interior smelled of cigarette smoke, which I didn't mind. It calmed my nerves. I started the engine and backed out of the driveway, heading toward town.\n",
      "I drove aimlessly, hoping to find someone who would help me, but none of them would stop. Some people told me I should turn myself in, others told me I was lucky to be alive, but no one offered to help me. Finally, a police officer approached me while I was driving down Main Street. He leaned against his cruiser, blocking my path. \"Can I help you?\" I asked.\n",
      "He smirked and pointed at my shirt. \"Is this your car?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"Yes, it is. Why do you ask?\" I asked.\n",
      "He tapped his chin, thinking. \"Well, it doesn't belong to you. I just reported a stolen vehicle earlier today. Now, here you are, driving it.\"\n",
      "\"That makes sense,\" I said, nodding. \"Thank you for telling me.\"\n",
      "He nodded back and walked back to his patrol car. I continued down the street, passing cars that sped past me. A few of the drivers gave me dirty looks, but most ignored me completely. I stopped at a light and waited impatiently, tapping my foot. The light turned green and I sped forward, weaving in between traffic. I passed another police cruiser and waved, trying to catch its attention. Nothing happened.\n",
      "I drove around the block and pulled into a parking lot, pulling my phone out of my pocket. I dialed a number that I hadn't used since I was little, but the person answered anyway.\n",
      "\"Hello?\" Daddy asked.\n",
      "\"Daddy, please come get me,\" I pleaded.\n",
      "\"Where are you, sweetheart?\"\n",
      "\"I'm at home,\" I lied.\n",
      "\"Okay, I'll be there shortly. Just wait for me, okay?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"I'm sorry, Daddy. I love you.\"\n",
      "\"I love you too, baby. Hang tight. I'm on my way.\"\n",
      "When I hung up the phone, I started crying. I was so scared, but I knew I wasn't alone. Daddy was on his way and would make sure I was safe.\n",
      "As soon as I saw the headlights of my father's car, I began to cry again. I wiped the tears from my eyes and stepped out of the car. Daddy opened the passenger door and held out his hand. When I grabbed hold of it, I noticed the ring on his finger. \n",
