# AISS-v1
The AISS measures the following story aspects:
* **Coherence**: Does the story feel plausible, coherent and has a clear thread? (higher = more coherent)
* **Avoiding Repetition**: Does the story avoid repetitions of elements? (higher = less repetitive)
* **Creativity/Quality**: Does the story feel innovative and of high quality? (higher = more creative/higher quality)
* **Pace**: Does nothing ever happen, or do things happen with a fast pace? (higher = faster pace)
* **Consistent Characterization**:  Are characters described consistently, with no contradictions? (higher = more consistency)

_Note: The questions are sorted by the story aspect that they measure. For an actual study, however, it is recommended to shuffle the order of the questions randomly.\
Some questions are marked with (reverse). These questions measure the opposite of the story aspect and answers need to be reverse-coded for analysis (a score of 1 gets coded as 5, 2 gets coded as 4, etc.)_

## Rating Points

1|2|3|4|5
-|-|-|-|-
Strongly disagree|Somewhat disagree|Neither agree or disagree|Somewhat agree|Strongly agree
